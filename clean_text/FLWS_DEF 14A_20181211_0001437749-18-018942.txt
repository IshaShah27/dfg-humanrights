October 29, 2018
This Proxy Statement is furnished to stockholders of record of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (the "Company") as of October 12, 2018 (the "Record Date") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), which will be held at One Old Country Road, Carle Place, New York 11514, Fourth Floor Conference Room (the "Meeting Place"), on Tuesday, December 11, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. eastern standard time or any adjournment thereof.
In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to every stockholder, we are now furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders on the Internet. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you may not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials other than as described below. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you as to how you may submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail and did not receive proxy materials by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's rules permit us to deliver a single Notice or set of Annual Meeting materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is referred to as "householding" and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have delivered only one proxy statement and annual report to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We agree to deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice or Annual Meeting materials, as requested, to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. If you prefer to receive separate copies of the proxy statement or annual report, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1.800.542.1061 or in writing at Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. If you are currently a stockholder sharing an address with another stockholder and wish to receive only one copy of future Notices, proxy statements and annual reports for your household, please contact Broadridge at the above phone number or address.
Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the owner is present in person or by proxy. All properly executed and unrevoked proxies in the accompanying form that are received in time for the Annual Meeting will be voted at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof in accordance with instructions thereon, or if no instructions are given, will be voted "FOR" the election of ten Directors named in this proxy statement, "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal and will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the person appointed as proxy with respect to other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. Any person giving a proxy may revoke it by written notice to the Company at any time prior to the exercise of the proxy. In addition, although mere attendance at the Annual Meeting will not revoke the proxy, a stockholder who attends the Annual Meeting may withdraw his or her proxy and vote in person. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will be counted in tabulations of the votes cast on each of the proposals presented at the Annual Meeting, whereas broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a proposal has been approved.
The Annual Report of the Company (which does not form a part of the proxy solicitation materials) is being made available on www.proxyvote.com concurrently herewith to stockholders.
The mailing address of the principal executive office of the Company is One Old Country Road, Suite 500, Carle Place, New York 11514.

The Board has no policy that requires the combination or separation of the roles of Chairman or Chief Executive Officer. Mr. J. McCann served as both our Chairman of the Board and our Chief Executive Officer until June 2016, at which point he ceased serving as Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that Mr. J. McCann is the director best suited to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. As the founder of the Company, he is most familiar with the Company's business and industry. He is uniquely situated to identify strategic priorities and to lead the Board in discussions regarding strategy and business planning and operations. In addition, his service on other public company boards of directors and their committees provide the Board with valuable board-level experience. The Company does not currently have a lead independent director.
Board Oversight of Risk Management
The Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, oversees the Company's risk management process, including operational, financial, legal, strategic, marketing and brand reputation risks. The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight of the risk management process. In addition, the Board is guided by management presentations at Board meetings and throughout the fiscal year that serve to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, evaluation and management of risks the Company is facing as well as how to mitigate such risks.
Information about the Board and its Committees
Each of our Directors, other than Messrs. James F. McCann and Christopher G. McCann, qualifies as an "independent director" as defined under the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests. For example, an independent director may not be employed by us and may not engage in certain types of business dealings with the Company. In addition, as further required by NASDAQ rules, the Board has made a subjective determination as to each independent Director that no relationship exists which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Director. In making these determinations, the Board reviewed and discussed information provided by the Directors and by the Company with regard to each Director's business and personal activities as they may relate to the Company and the Company's management. In addition, as required by NASDAQ rules, the Board determined that the members of the Audit Committee each qualify as "independent" under special standards established by NASDAQ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") for members of audit committees. The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that it is critical for the Directors to have varying points of view, with a broad spectrum of experience, education, skills, backgrounds, professional and life experience that, when viewed as the collective group, provide an ample blend of perspectives to allow the Board to fulfill its duties to the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders.
The table below provides current membership and meeting information for each of the Board committees for Fiscal 2018.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reports to the Board regarding the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accountants, the scope and results of its annual audits, compliance with accounting and financial policies and management's procedures and policies relative to the adequacy of internal accounting controls. The Company's Board of Directors adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee in January 2000, as amended in August 2003, which outlines the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. A current copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is available on our website located at www.1800flowers.com under the Investor Relations section of the website.
Each member of the Audit Committee is "financially literate" as required by NASDAQ rules. The Audit Committee also includes at least one member, Eugene DeMark, who was determined by the Board to meet the qualifications of an "audit committee financial expert" in accordance with Commission rules and to meet the qualifications of "financial sophistication" in accordance with NASDAQ rules. Stockholders should understand that these designations relate to our Audit Committee members' experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters and do not impose upon any of them any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than those generally imposed on a member of the Audit Committee or of the Board.
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the Company's compensation philosophy and makes a final determination on all forms of compensation to be provided to the Company's Section 16 Executive Officers ("Executive Officers"), including base salary and the provisions of the Sharing Success Program under which annual incentive compensation may be awarded. In addition, the Compensation Committee administers the Company's 2003 Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan, as amended and restated as of October 22, 2009, as amended as of October 28, 2011 and September 14, 2016 ("2003 Plan") under which option grants, stock appreciation rights, restricted awards, performance awards and equity awards may be made to Directors, officers, employees of, and consultants to, the Company and its subsidiaries. See "Named Executive Officer Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Sharing Success Program and Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards." The Board of Directors has authorized Mr. James F. McCann to review awards for all of the Company's employees, other than its Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding Directors' compensation. The Company's Board of Directors adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee in June 2003, as amended in June 2013, which outlines the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee. All of the members of the Company's Compensation Committee are independent directors and have never been employees of the Company. A current copy of the charter of the Compensation Committee is available on our web site located at www.1800flowers.com under the Investor Relations section of the website.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the oversight of the evaluation of the Board of Directors, including its size and composition; it reviews and reassesses the adequacy of corporate governance guidelines and practices and develops and recommends to the Board the Company's corporate governance guidelines and practices; and identifies and evaluates individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board, Director nominees for election and re-election. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations for prospective nominees for the Board from other members of the Board, management and others, including Stockholders, and may employ third-party search firms. The Company's Board of Directors adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in June 2003, which outlines the responsibilities of the Committee. A current copy of the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is available on our website located at www.1800flowers.com under the Investor Relations section of the website.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No interlocking relationships exist between the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors or the compensation committee of any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past. No member of the Compensation Committee was an officer or employee of the Company at any time during Fiscal 2018.
Communication with Board of Directors
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews letters from stockholders concerning the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders and governance process, including recommendations of director candidates, and makes recommendations to the Board based on such communications. Stockholders can send communications to the Board and to the non-management Directors by mail in care of the Corporate Secretary at One Old Country Road, Suite 500, Carle Place, NY 11514, Attention: Michael R. Manley, and should specify the intended recipient or recipients. All such communications, other than unsolicited commercial solicitations or communications, will be forwarded to the appropriate Director or Directors for review. Any such unsolicited commercial solicitation or communication not forwarded to the appropriate Director or Directors will be available to any non-management Director who wishes to review it.
Attendance at Meetings 
During Fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors held five meetings and acted by unanimous written consent on four occasions. During Fiscal 2018, all incumbent Directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the meetings held by all committees of the Board of which they were a member. We expect Messrs. J. McCann and C. McCann, and no other directors, to attend the Annual Meeting; Messrs. J. McCann and C. McCann, and no other directors, attended last year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") requires our Executive Officers and Directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Commission. Executive Officers, Directors, and greater than 10% stockholders are required by Commission regulations to furnish us with copies of all reports they file pursuant to Section 16(a).
Based on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, we believe that all Section 16(a) filings requirements applicable to our Executive Officers, Directors and greater than 10% stockholders have been satisfied, with the exception of the following inadvertent late filings.  Non-executive directors Larry Zarin, Sean P. Hegarty, Katherine Oliver, James A. Cannavino, Eugene F. DeMark, Geralyn Breig, and Celia Brown each filed one late Form 4 relating to receipt of Common Stock as compensation for serving as a director, an exempt transaction under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.  James A. Cannavino also filed one late Form 4 relating to the sale of shares.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
This section discusses compensation to our Fiscal 2018 Named Executive Officers, which consist of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and the three next most highly compensated Executive Officers of the Company, as determined under the rules of the Commission (collectively, the "NEOs").
The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation programs for its NEOs, as well as all of its Executive Officers, should reflect the Company's performance and the value created for the Company's stockholders. In addition, the compensation programs should support the short-term and long-term strategic goals and values of the Company and should reward individual loyalty to the Company and contribution to the Company's success. The Company is engaged in a very competitive industry, and the Company's success depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified Executive Officers through the competitive compensation packages it offers to such individuals.
The fundamental policy of the Compensation Committee is to provide the Company's NEOs, as well as its Executive Officers, with competitive compensation opportunities based upon their contribution to the development and financial success of the Company. It is the Compensation Committee's philosophy that a significant portion of each NEO's and Executive Officer's compensation should be contingent upon the Company's financial performance. The Company also acknowledges the importance of attracting and retaining talented, motivated and success-oriented Executive Officers who share our overall corporate philosophy and will enable our Company to achieve its short and long-term goals. Accordingly, the compensation package for each NEO and Executive Officer is comprised of three elements: (i) base salary; (ii) annual incentives; and (iii) long-term incentive equity awards.
Guiding Principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Teamwork - To encourage executives to work together effectively and efficiently so that company goals can be fully realized.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Innovation - To encourage and reward creativity and innovation, including the development of new ideas and business opportunities for the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Market competitiveness - To offer a strong, comprehensive compensation package that will enable the Company to attract and retain qualified executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
Setting Executive Compensation 
We compete for senior executive talent with many leading companies. In order to stay competitive in the marketplace, a critical component of which is the recruitment and retention of executive talent, we periodically review the market competitiveness of our Executive Officer compensation programs. The Compensation Committee also reviews the Company's recent historical compensation practices for its executives, and considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer regarding the compensation of his direct reports, who include the other NEOs. At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the advisory vote on executive compensation passed by an overwhelming majority.  Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not implement changes to the design of our executive compensation program as a result of the advisory vote. In connection with this review, the Compensation Committee retained the services of Mercer LLC for Fiscal 2018 ("Mercer") (see "Role of Compensation Consultant" below for further discussion of Mercer's role).
Elements of Compensation
The Compensation Committee believes that we can maximize the effectiveness of our compensation program by ensuring that all program elements are working in concert to motivate and reward performance. The elements of our executive compensation program are detailed below, together with the principal factors that the Compensation Committee considers in reviewing the components of each Executive Officer's compensation package. In general, for each compensation element, these factors include: the key role each Executive Officer performs for the Company; the benefit to the Company in assuring the retention of his or her services; the performance of the Company during the past fiscal year; the competitive market conditions for executive compensation; the executive's prior year compensation; and the objective evaluation of the Executive Officer's performance. The Compensation Committee may also, however, in its discretion, apply other factors with respect to executive compensation. We believe that our executive compensation program effectively strengthens the mutuality of interests between the Executive Officers and the Company's stockholders, which results in greater Company performance.
Base Salary. The Compensation Committee views base salary as the assured element of compensation that permits income predictability. Subject to existing employment agreements, our objective is to set base salary levels at the competitive norm. However, individual salaries may be above or below the competitive norm to reflect the strategic role, experience, proficiency and performance of the executive. Incumbents who have been in their positions for a longer period of time, and whose performance is superior, may be paid above the competitive norm. In addition, in the case of seasoned executives with strategic value who are newly hired into the Company, it may be necessary to pay above the competitive norm in order to attract the best candidates to the Company.
The minimum base salaries for Messrs. J. McCann and C. McCann are primarily prescribed in their employment agreements (see below for description of the employment agreements in the "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table"). Annual base salary increases for the NEOs and other Executive Officers are determined on the basis of the employment agreements (for Messrs. J. McCann, C. McCann), as well as the following factors: the performance of the executive versus job responsibilities; the relationship between current salary and the range for the executive's level, ranges having been set in part based on the competitive norm in the industry; the average size of salary increase based upon the Company's financial performance; and whether the responsibilities or criticality of the position of the incumbents have been changed during the preceding year. The weight given to each of these factors may differ from individual to individual as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. Increases for Fiscal 2018 for Messrs. J. McCann, C. McCann, Shea, Hartnett, and Gallagher were approximately 0%, 0%, 11.1%, 6.3%, and 2.3%, respectively.     
Annual Incentive Award. Annual incentive awards play a significant role in the Company's overall compensation package for its Executive Officers. The annual incentive award for the NEOs is based upon the Company's financial performance and, in the case of Mr. Hartnett, also includes brand specific financial performance. This balance supports the accomplishment of the Company's overall financial objectives and rewards the individual contributions of our NEOs. Annual incentive programs for Executive Officers support the following company objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Motivation for the entire management team to work together toward a common set of goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Reward executives on the basis of results achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Deliver annual incentive opportunities and payments through a structured, performance driven, objective mechanism.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Deliver a competitive level of compensation that is fully competitive with industry practice.  
[END TABLE]
NEOs are eligible to receive annual incentive awards under the Company's Sharing Success Program.
Sharing Success Program. The Sharing Success Program is intended to cover management positions, including the NEOs. Each eligible plan participant is assigned a target award (expressed as a percentage of base salary), which represents the level of incentive award the participant can expect to earn in the event all performance measures are achieved at 100% during the ensuing fiscal year. For each fiscal year, specific performance measures are established by the Compensation Committee that reflect the key strategic and business goals established by the business plan for that year. EBITDA as used for purposes of the Sharing Success Program is defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense on a pre-bonus basis, adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions completed during the fiscal year as well as the impact of investment gains or losses on the Company's non-qualified supplemental deferred compensation plan ("Plan EBITDA"). Revenue as used for purposes of the Sharing Success Program is defined as achieving or exceeding revenue growth in line with the Company's budget adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions completed during the fiscal year ("Plan Revenue"). Brand-specific Plan EBITDA as used for purposes of the Sharing Success Program is defined as EBITDA for the brand less corporate expenses ("Brand-specific Plan EBITDA"). Corporate expenses consist of the Company's enterprise shared service cost centers, and include, among other items, Information Technology, Human Resources, Accounting and Finance, Legal, and Executive, as well as Stock-Based Compensation. In order to leverage the Company's infrastructure, these functions are operated under a centralized management platform, providing support services throughout the organization. Brand performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or Brand-specific Plan EBITDA, reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segments. Brand-specific Plan Revenue as used for purposes of the Sharing Success Program is defined as achieving or exceeding revenue growth based on the Brand's budget for the fiscal year ("Brand-specific Plan Revenue").
The following table presents the NEOs targeted incentive award opportunity, as a percentage of their salary ("target award"), and the performance measures and relative weighting of their components for Fiscal 2018:

[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)   On October 4, 2016, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. J. McCann (the "JM 2016 Agreement"). Under the JM 2016 Agreement, Mr. J. McCann became the Executive Chairman of the Board, with a salary of $975,000 in Fiscal 2018, and his annual long-term incentive award will be 75% of his salary in the form of performance restricted shares under the 2003 Plan. He no longer participates in the Company's non-equity based bonus program. The Company will annually credit an amount equal to Mr. J. McCann's base salary to his retirement account under the Company's Nonqualified Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan.  
[END TABLE]
For Fiscal 2018, in the case of Messrs. Shea, C. McCann and Gallagher, performance measures were the achievement of Company-wide Plan EBITDA and Plan Revenue. For Mr. Hartnett, performance measures were the aggregate of the achievement of: (i) brand-specific Plan EBITDA, (ii) brand-specific Plan Revenue, (iii) Company-wide Plan EBITDA, and (iv) Company-wide Plan Revenue.
When Company-wide and/or brand-specific actual results exceed or fall below performance measures, actual awards are proportionately increased or decreased from the target awards. Participants may earn no Company-wide or brand-specific bonus if the threshold performance measures are not met (defined as achievement of 90% of Company-wide Plan EBITDA and 60% of Company-wide Plan Revenue, resulting in a 37.5% and 50% pay-out of the Plan EBITDA and Plan Revenue target award, respectively), and no participant may be paid an incentive award under the Sharing Success Program in excess of maximum (defined as achievement of 150% of Company-wide Plan EBITDA and 200% of Company-wide Plan Revenue, resulting in a 200% pay-out of each target award), as presented in the table below. In addition, all participants must be actively employed at the time of payment in order to qualify for the award.

For Fiscal 2018, the Company's performance measures were a function of achieving specified EBITDA and Revenue targets and were as follows: Company-wide Plan EBITDA of $105.9 million and Company-wide Plan Revenue of $1.16 billion. Brand-specific measures for Fiscal 2018 for Consumer Floral and BloomNet were as follows: (i) Plan EBITDA of $96.5 million, and (ii) Plan Revenue of $565.1 million.
The following table reflects the relationship of actual performance against the Company's performance measures. The performance measures range from "threshold" (the minimum achievement level of the performance measure at which an executive may earn 37.5% and 50% of the target award for Plan EBITDA and Plan Revenue) to "maximum" (the maximum achievement level of the performance measure at which an executive may earn 200% of the target award). The weighting of performance measures is applied to the Target Award Multiples to produce the executive's cash bonus award.

 (1)   Per the terms of the Company's Sharing Success Program, in order to be eligible to receive a payout under the Revenue Growth Measure, the minimum EBITDA measure must also be attained. Since the Fiscal 2018 threshold for Company-wide EBITDA measure was not attained, there was no payout for the revenue growth measure.

During Fiscal 2018, the Company-wide Actual EBITDA and Revenue Award was 0%. The Company-wide Actual Award Multiple for Fiscal 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 32.5%, 56.0%, 103.7%, and 69.8%, of the target award, respectively. See "Summary Compensation Table - Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" for payout amounts for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016.
Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards. In order to structure a long-term incentive program for the Company's Executive Officers that would tie a significant portion of their compensation to the profitability of the Company, the Compensation Committee evaluated its long-term incentive equity awards. All award grants are designed to align the interests of each Executive Officer with those of the stockholders and provide each individual with a significant incentive to manage the Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the Company.
The grant of an award is set at a level intended to create a meaningful incentive based in part on the Executive Officer's and NEO's current position with the Company, the base salary associated with that position, the size of comparable awards made to individuals in similar positions within the industry, and the individual's personal performance in recent periods. The Compensation Committee also takes into account the number of awards held by the Executive Officer in order to maintain an appropriate level of incentive for that individual. The Compensation Committee has the authority to review extraordinary events that impact the Company's performance and may adjust the calculation of an award by taking into account the effect of any such extraordinary events.
In Fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an equity award grant for management level employees with a grant date of November 3, 2017. This grant was intended to align shareholder interest with the long-term growth of the Company, as well as address employee retention concerns. The Fiscal 2018 performance-based equity award provided the NEOs with the opportunity to earn 100% of their target share award if the Company achieved $105.9 million of Plan EBITDA and Plan Revenue of 4.9%, weighted such that 65% of the target share award was tied to achievement of the EBITDA metric, and 35% of the target share award was tied to the revenue growth metric. The award scaled, on a pro-rata basis, to 37.5% of their target share award if the Company achieved a minimum of 90% of its Fiscal 2018 Plan EBITDA, and 50% of their target share award if the Company achieved a minimum of 60% of its Plan Revenue. During Fiscal 2018, the Company did not achieve the minimum EBITDA metric and, as such, there was no payout under the Performance Based Equity Incentive Plan. Refer to Grants of Plan-Based Awards for disclosures of shares earned. (See "Summary Compensation Table").
Executive Benefits
The Company's NEOs are eligible for the same level and offering of benefits made available to other employees, including our 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (which includes a discretionary annual Company contribution), health care plan and other welfare benefit programs. We do not currently maintain any qualified or nonqualified defined benefit pension plans or nonqualified deferred compensation plans for our NEOs, except for the Nonqualified Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan discussed below.
During Fiscal 2018, the Company offered a Nonqualified Supplemental Deferred Compensation Plan for certain executives. Participants can defer from 1% up to a maximum of 100% of salary and performance and non-performance based bonuses. Until January 1, 2017, the Company matched 50% of the deferrals made by each participant during the applicable period, up to a maximum of $2,500 per calendar year. Participating employees are vested in the Company's contributions based upon years of participation in the Plan. Distributions are made to participants upon termination of employment or death in a lump sum, unless installments are selected.
Perquisites
We do not routinely provide any significant perquisites to our NEOs. Except for Messrs. J. McCann's and C. McCann's perquisites, which are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, the value of perquisites to each other NEO in Fiscal 2018 did not exceed $10,000.
Severance/Change of Control
We do not maintain any severance or change of control plans or agreements. However, pursuant to the terms of employment agreements and incentive plans, certain NEOs are eligible to receive severance and other benefits in the case of certain termination events and in the case of a change in control. See "Potential Payments upon Termination and Change in Control" below.
Management's Role in Setting Executive Compensation
Although the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes the Company's compensation philosophy and makes the final determinations on all compensation paid to our Executive Officers, the Chief Executive Officer works closely with the Senior Vice President of Human Resources to develop compensation programs and policies and make recommendations regarding annual adjustments to the Executive Officers' salaries and incentive award opportunities (other than his own compensation).
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has retained the services of Mercer to provide specialized information and targeted research to assist us in the development of compensation and retention strategies. Mercer provided general assistance to our Senior Vice President of Human Resources and the Compensation Committee and does not perform any other services for the Company. For Fiscal 2018, Mercer's services were in advising on benchmark data for base salary, bonus targets and long-term incentives for the Company. Mr. C. McCann participated in discussions with Mercer in Fiscal 2018 regarding the Fiscal 2018 compensation of the NEOs other than himself.
Compensation Deductibility Policy
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") generally places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation a public company can deduct in any year for each of its "covered employees" (which, under current law, includes the current and certain former Named Executive Officers). Although the Committee takes into account the deductibility of compensation as a factor in determining executive compensation, the Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that is designed to attract, retain and reward the executive talent necessary to the success of the Company. Accordingly, the Committee has retained the discretion to approve compensation that is not deductible under Section 162(m).
Effective for Fiscal 2018 and prior years, the limit on deductibility of Named Executive Officer compensation did not apply to compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m). Accordingly, the 2003 Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan (as amended and restated as of October 22, 2009, as amended as of October 28, 2011 and September 14, 2016) and the Section 16 Executive Officers Bonus Plan (as amended and restated as of September 14, 2016) contain certain provisions that were intended to permit any compensation deemed paid in connection with the granting of awards or bonus compensation to be able to qualify as "performance-based compensation." However, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) in fact satisfies such requirements.
Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, amendments to Section 162(m) enacted last December generally repealed the exception for "performance-based compensation" and modified the definition of "covered employees" to include the chief financial officer and certain former Named Executive Officers of the Company. In making future compensation decisions, the Committee intends to take into account any available grandfather provisions to preserve the deductibility of previously granted compensation under the amendments to Section 162(m). However, due to the repeal of the exceptions under Section 162(m) described above, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of the $1 million limit under Section 162(m) will generally not be deductible.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis provisions to be included in the Company's filings pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis referred to above be included in such filings.

Potential Payments upon Termination and Change in Control
The Company does not have a formalized severance policy. In accordance with the 2003 Plan, in the event of a Change of Control, as defined in the 2003 Plan, all outstanding Awards, pursuant to which a Participant may have rights the exercise of which is restricted or limited, shall automatically become fully exercisable immediately prior to the time of the Change of Control and all performance criteria and other conditions shall be deemed to be achieved or fulfilled and shall be waived by the Company immediately prior to the time of the Change of Control so that the Shares subject to the Award will be entitled to participate in the Change of Control transaction.
In addition, as disclosed in Potential Payments Upon Termination and Change in Control, certain executives within the Company have individual employment agreements that contain negotiated provisions that trigger payments or provision of benefits upon termination or a change in control. Payment and benefit levels under the various circumstances that trigger payments or provision of benefits upon termination or a change in control for Messrs. James McCann and Christopher McCann were calculated and presented in accordance with the provisions of their respective employment agreements. For Fiscal 2018, potential payments under the circumstances triggered upon termination or change of control did not have a material impact on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of all other elements of compensation or total compensation.
The following table sets forth the potential payments to our NEOs under existing agreements, plans or arrangements, for various scenarios involving a change in control or termination of employment, assuming a July 1, 2018 termination date and using the closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on July 1, 2018 ($12.55). Pursuant to the terms of the Sharing Success Program, the amounts shown do not include the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards that were earned as of July 1, 2018. The exact amount of payments and benefits that would be provided can only be determined at the actual time of the NEO's separation from the Company.

Upon termination for Good Cause, voluntary resignation without Good Reason or termination due to death, Mr. McCann is not entitled to any compensation from the Company, except for the payment of any base salary, bonuses, benefits or unreimbursed expenses accrued but unpaid as of the termination date. As discussed above, Mr. McCann is restricted from participating in a competitive business for a period of two years after a voluntary resignation or termination for Good Cause. He is also bound by confidentiality provisions, which prohibit him from, among other things, disseminating or using confidential information about the Company in any way that would be adverse to the Company.
2003 Long Term Incentive and Share Award Plan
The 2003 Plan provides that, unless otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee at the time of the award grant, in the event of a change of control, (i) all outstanding awards pursuant to which the participant may have rights the exercise of which is restricted or limited, shall become fully exercisable immediately prior to the time of the change of control so that the shares subject to the award will be entitled to participate in the change of control transaction, and (ii) unless the right to lapse of restrictions or limitations is waived or deferred by a participant prior to such lapse, all restrictions or limitations (including risks of forfeiture and deferrals) on outstanding awards subject to restrictions or limitations under the 2003 Plan shall lapse, and all performance criteria and other conditions to payment of awards under which payments of cash, shares or other property are subject to conditions shall be deemed to be achieved or fulfilled and shall be waived by the Company immediately prior to the time of the change of control so that the shares subject to the award will be entitled to participate in the change of control transaction.
Executive Pay Ratio
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median associate, which is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules, based on our payroll and employment records. The 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee, other than Mr. Christopher McCann, was $26,624. Mr. McCann's 2018 annual total compensation was $1,492,750, and the ratio of those amounts is 1-to-56. For purposes of identifying the median compensated employee, we took into account salary, bonus, and grant date fair value of restricted stock awards granted during Fiscal 2018 for all our employees as of July 1, 2018. We annualized this compensation for employees who did not work the entire year, except for employees designated as seasonal or temporary.

Each of the Group Members other than James F. McCann, Public, and the Marylou McCann Trust executed the McCann Family Stockholders' Agreement dated as of July 18, 2017 (the "Stockholders' Agreement"), which was filed as Exhibit 3 to the Schedule 13D filed by the Group Members with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2017.  
Under the Stockholders' Agreement, the Children's Trusts, the 2012 Trusts, and the Family Partnerships (collectively with each person that acquires Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock and becomes a party to the Stockholders' Agreement, the "Stockholders") have agreed to vote as a group with respect to any matter on which any of the shares of Common Stock held by them are entitled to vote. In the case of the 1996 Family Partnership, such agreement applies only to that percentage of the shares owned by the partnership that represents ownership interests other than the limited partnership interest of Christopher G. McCann.
Decisions on how the Stockholders will vote with respect to their shares of Common Stock will be made in accordance with the determination of the McCann Family Committee. The McCann Family Committee consists of Marylou McCann, Christopher G. McCann and the three children of James F. McCann and Marylou McCann: Erin Moore Lenehan, James F. McCann, III, and Matthew E. McCann. The McCann Family Committee generally acts by vote of a majority of the members, except in respect of a Change in Control (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement) of the Company. The prior approval of at least 75% of the members of the McCann Family Committee is required for any disposition that will result in a Change in Control.
Subject to the other transfer provisions, if a Stockholder proposes to sell any shares of Common Stock to a person other than a Permitted Transferee (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement), the other Stockholders will have a right of first refusal to buy such shares and, if the other Stockholders do not elect to purchase all such shares, the members of the McCann Family Committee shall have the right to purchase the remaining shares.
The prior approval by a majority of the McCann Family Committee members is required for any gift or bequest by any Stockholder of shares of Class A Common Stock to anyone other than a Permitted Transferee and of shares of Class B Common Stock to anyone other than an Affiliate (as defined in the Stockholders' Agreement).
The foregoing summary of the Stockholders' Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stockholders' Agreement.
Certain Business Relationships with Directors and Officers
The Company has a policy providing that all material transactions between it and one or more of its Directors, Executive Officers, nominees for Director or a member of their immediate families must be approved either by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board or by the stockholders of the Company.
While the policy is not in writing, the Company's legal and finance staff is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from the Directors and Executive Officers with respect to related person transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether the Company or a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. This includes inquiries of its Directors and Executive Officers, as well as a questionnaire that Directors and Executive Officers are required to complete periodically. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the disinterested members of the Board will consider the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include the relationship of the individual with the Company, the materiality of the transaction to the Company and the individual, and the business purpose and reasonableness of the transaction.  As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to the Company or a related person, are disclosed in the Company's proxy statement. The Company considers individual transactions, or any series of transactions which, in the aggregate exceed $120,000, to be material and requiring of disclosure.
Below are the transactions that occurred during Fiscal 2018 in which, to the Company's knowledge, the Company was or is a party, in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000, and in which any Director, Director nominee, Executive Officer, holder of more than 5% of the Common Stock or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
For Fiscal 2018, Julie Mulligan, the sister of Directors and Executive Officers, James F. McCann and Christopher G. McCann, was employed as a Senior Vice President of Product Development and Content. Ms. Mulligan's compensation was unanimously approved by the Independent Directors of the Board. Ms. Mulligan's earned $160,000 in Fiscal 2018. Ms. Mulligan was not eligible to receive a bonus under the Company's annual incentive plan ("Sharing Success Program") for Fiscal 2018.
For Fiscal 2018, James F. McCann III, the son of Executive Chairman James F. McCann and nephew of Director, CEO and President Christopher G. McCann, was employed as a Director, Business Development. Mr. McCann's compensation was unanimously approved by the Independent Directors of the Board. Mr. McCann's base salary for Fiscal 2018 was $126,694. Mr. McCann did not receive a bonus under the Sharing Success Program for Fiscal 2018.
Effective July 9, 2018, Gerard M. Gallagher transitioned from his role as General Counsel, Senior Vice President and Corporate Secretary to the role of Senior Vice President, Business Affairs. Mr. Gallagher is the founder and managing partner in the law firm of Gallagher, Walker, Bianco & Plastaras, LLP based in Mineola, New York. Compensation for Mr. Gallagher's services are paid to the law firm. The Company, with the approval of the Board, also pays the law firm fees for services rendered by other members of the firm on the Company's behalf.
In Fiscal 2018, the Company paid the firm (i) $443,000 for services provided by Mr. Gallagher and (ii) $703,000 in fees for legal services provided by other members of the firm and $27,000 in disbursements. The Company believes that collectively these fees and disbursements are fair and reasonable.
October 29, 2018
  To the Board of Directors  of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INC. (the "Company"):
We, the members of the Audit Committee, assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company's financial accounting, reporting and controls. We also evaluate the performance and independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. We operate under a written charter that both the Board and we have approved. A current copy of the Audit Committee charter can be found on the Company's website located at www.1800flowers.com under the Investor Relations section of the website.
The Board annually reviews the NASDAQ listing standards definition of independence for audit committee members and has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets that standard. In addition, although the Board has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee meets NASDAQ regulatory requirements for financial literacy and that Eugene DeMark is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by Commission rules, and is financially sophisticated under NASDAQ requirements, we would like to remind our stockholders that we are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not technical experts in auditing or accounting.
The Company's management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, including setting the accounting and financial reporting principles and designing the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. The Company's management is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of the Company's system of internal control. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP ("BDO"), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The independent registered public accounting firm is also responsible for expressing opinions on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as well as management's assessment thereof. Although the Board is the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including oversight of the management of the Company, the Audit Committee's purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing these processes, as well as overseeing the qualifications and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has policies and procedures that require the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of all fees paid to, and all services performed by, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Annually, the Audit Committee approves the proposed services, including the nature, type and scope of service contemplated and the related fees, to be rendered by the firm during the year. In addition, Audit Committee pre-approval is also required for those engagements that may arise during the course of the year that are outside the scope of the initial services and fees approved by the Audit Committee. For each category of proposed service, the independent accounting firm is required to confirm that the provision of such services does not impair their independence. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the fees and services provided (as noted in the table below) were authorized and approved by the Audit Committee in compliance with the pre-approval policies and procedures described herein.
We reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board No. 16. We received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firms' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with BDO their independence. This review included a discussion with management and the independent registered public accounting firm of the quality (and not merely the acceptability) of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in the Company's Financial Statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies.
Based on the reports, discussions and reviews described in this report, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PROPOSAL 2
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors has appointed BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and the Board is asking stockholders to ratify such selection at the Annual Meeting. The stockholders' ratification of the appointment of BDO will not impact the Audit Committee's responsibility pursuant to its charter, to appoint, replace and discharge the independent auditors. In the event the stockholders fail to ratify this selection, the matter of the selection of independent auditors will be reconsidered by the Board of Directors.
We are not required to submit the appointment of BDO for ratification by our stockholders. However, we are doing so as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of BDO, the audit committee may reconsider its decision. In any case, our audit committee may, in its discretion, appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it believes that such change would be in the Company's best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.
The affirmative votes of the majority of the Company's outstanding Common Stock present in person or by proxy is required to ratify the appointment of the independent registered accounting firm. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holder will vote the proxies received by him "FOR" the ratification of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2019. A representative of BDO USA, LLP will attend the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and will also be available to answer inquiries.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION AND APPROVAL OF THE SELECTION OF BDO USA, LLP TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL 2019.
Fees Paid to Independent Public Accounting Firms

In addition, the Audit Committee also may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis, as required.
PROPOSAL 3
Give Each Share One Equal Vote
A person who purports to be the beneficial holder of no less than 500 shares of Class A Common Stock has advised the Company that he intends to have his proxy introduce the proposal set forth below at the Annual Meeting. The name and address of such shareholder is Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021. Mr. Steiner has appointed John Chevedden of 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205 Redondo Beach, CA 90278 and/or Mr. Chevedden's designee to act on his behalf in matters relating to the proposal.
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that our Board take steps to adopt a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have an equal vote per share. This would comprise all practicable steps including encouragement and negotiation with family shareholders to request that they relinquish, for the common good of all shareholders, any preexisting rights.
This proposal is not intended to unnecessarily limit our Board's judgment in crafting the requested change in accordance with applicable laws and existing contracts.
With the McCann family stock having super-sized voting power our company takes our public shareholder money but does not let us have an equal voice in our company's management. Without a voice, we as shareholders cannot hold management accountable.
The McCann family controls 92% of FLWS stock. Meanwhile regular shareholders only get one vote per share. Yet insider shareholders get a wholping10 votes per share.
News Corp. is another company like ours. "If you are buying shares in [News Corp.], it's buyer beware," says Sydney Finkelstein, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. "There is no management or leadership reason to have two classes of stock except to retain control."
The Council of Institutional Investors, whose members manage $3 trillion of assets, asked NASDAQ to stop listing new companies that offer dual share classes. The effort is a new approach to curbing a structure it has criticized for years as unfair and harmful to long-term stock returns.
Our clearly improvable corporate governance (as reported in 2018) is an added incentive to vote for this proposal. Limits on shareholder rights and management-controlled takeover defense mechanisms currently in place at FLWS include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The board's unilateral ability to amend the company's bylaws without shareholder approval  
● Business combination provisions that failed to include protections of shareholder interests  
● Fair price provisions that failed to insure that all shareholders are treated fairly  
● Limits on the right of shareholders to convene a special or emergency meeting  
● The absence of confidential voting policies  
[END TABLE]
Additional concerns included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Threat of Delisting  
● Related Party Transactions  
● Entrenched Board — Two directors had 31-years tenure each.  
● Overboarded Director  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Excessive Severance Vesting  
● Controlling Shareholder Concerns  
● Multiple Equity Classes with Different Voting Rights  
● Asset-Liability Valuation  
● The company paid long-term incentives to executives without requiring company performance above the median of its peer group. Incentive pay plans that pay for mediocre performance undermine the critical link between executive pay and company performance.  
● The company failure to establish and disclose specific standards regarding minimum stock retention for its CEO and directors may weaken the ability of equity pay to align executives' interests with long-term value creation.  
[END TABLE]
Returning to the core topic of this proposal from the context of our clearly improvable corporate performance,
Please vote to protect shareholder value:  Give Each Share One Equal Vote — Proposal 3
Company Opposing Statement 
Our Board of Directors believes that our capital structure has provided significant stability and has fostered the growth of the Company. Since founding the Company in 1976, the McCann family's involvement in the Company has been one of its greatest strengths. Their commitment to the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders has been, and continues to be, the primary purpose of their involvement. As a direct result of the dual-class structure, the McCann family has a special interest in the long-term success of the Company and provides stability in the face of short-term market pressures and outside influences. This structure also ensures that the Company has a solid and loyal investor base throughout economic downturns and crises.
In addition, the share structure has been in place since the Company went public in 1999 and has been disclosed in detail in public filings with the SEC. Every investor purchasing a share of Class A stock is aware of this capital structure and many are attracted to our stock by the long-term stability that our founders and majority shareholders, the McCann family, provide to the Company. The Proposal seeks to upend the established relationship among the Company's shareholders by ignoring the foundational compact on which the relationship was formed, as well as the fundamental equitable interests that the holders of both classes of stock established by their reliance on that structure.
Moreover, dual class capital structures are recognized and valid under applicable federal and corporate law and stock exchange regulations, and are not uncommon among public companies. Various companies have had dual class capital structures for many years and companies continue to implement dual class capital structures.
Shareholders are also protected within the capital structure through the Company's commitment to sound corporate governance practices, which is in part reflected in the Company's declassification of the Board of Directors at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In addition, eight out of ten of the members of our Board of Directors are independent under applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules, and each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. We believe the independent members of our Board of Directors provide valuable guidance to management and are the stewards of the Company's strong commitment to long-term success and shareholder value.
 As a result of the foregoing, we believe the current share capital structure is in the best interests of our shareholders and that our current corporate governance structure is sound and effective. Therefore, the Board of Directors recommends a vote "against" this Proposal.
The affirmative votes of the majority of the Company's outstanding Common Stock present in person or by proxy is required to approve the foregoing shareholder proposal. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holder will vote the proxies received by him "AGAINST" Proposal 3.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 3.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board of Directors does not intend to bring any other business before the Annual Meeting, and so far, as is known to the Board, no matters are to be presented for action at the Annual Meeting other than those set forth above. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote the shares represented by proxies in their discretion on such matters.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING
Shareholders who, in accordance with Commission Rule 14a-8 wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed in connection with next year's Annual Meeting Proxy Statement must submit their proposals so that they are received at the Company's principal executive offices no later than the close of business on July 1, 2019. As the rules of the Commission make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included.
In accordance with our Bylaws, in order to be properly brought before the 2019 Annual Meeting, a shareholder's notice of the matter the shareholder wishes to present, or the person or persons the shareholder wishes to nominate as a director, must be delivered to the secretary of the Company at its principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary date of the 2018 Annual Meeting date. As a result, any notice given by a shareholder pursuant to these provisions of our Bylaws (and not pursuant to the Commission's Rule 14a-8) must be received no earlier than August 13, 2019 and no later than September 12, 2019. If, however, our 2019 Annual Meeting date is advanced by more than 30 days before, or delayed more than 70 days after, the one year anniversary of the 2018 Annual Meeting date, then proposals must be received no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day before the 2019 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the date on which the 2019 Annual Meeting date is publicly announced.
To be in proper form, a shareholder's notice must include the specified information concerning the proposal or nominee as described in our Bylaws. A shareholder who wishes to submit a proposal or nomination is encouraged to seek independent counsel about our Bylaws and Commission requirements. The Company will not consider any proposal or nomination that does not meet the Bylaws requirements and the Commission's requirements for submitting a proposal or nomination. Notices of intention to present proposals at the 2019 Annual Meeting should be addressed to: Corporate Secretary, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., One Old Country Road, Suite 500, Carle Place, New York 11514. The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
Proxies are being solicited by the Board of Directors of the Company. Proxies may be solicited by officers, Directors and regular supervisory and executive employees of the Company, none of whom will receive any additional compensation for their services. Such solicitations may be made personally or by mail, facsimile, telephone, telegraph, messenger, or via the Internet. The Company may pay persons holding shares of Common Stock in their names or in the names of nominees, but not owning such shares beneficially, such as brokerage houses, banks and other fiduciaries, for expenses of forwarding solicitation materials to their principals. All of the costs of solicitation will be paid by the Company.
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
The Company will provide without charge to each beneficial holder of its Common Stock on the Record Date who did not receive a copy of the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018, on the written request of such person, a copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Commission. Any such request should be made in writing to the Secretary of the Company at the address set forth on the first page of this Proxy Statement.
By order of the Board of Directors
/s/ Christopher G. McCann
