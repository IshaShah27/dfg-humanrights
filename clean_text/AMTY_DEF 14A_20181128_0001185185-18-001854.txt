Dear Amerityre Shareholders:
During fiscal 2018 Amerityre continued to implement changes that in the long run will make it a more stable and successful company. While our overall results showed a net loss before preferred dividends of approximately $39,000 and virtually flat year-over-year sales, these figures do not tell the complete story. Despite challenging conditions in several target markets which were in contrast to the improving overall U.S. economy, we were able to maintain our overall sales in FY2018 compared to the previous fiscal year. Over the past 12 months, many of our suppliers raised prices as demand for chemicals and other raw materials increased with the higher economic activity. While we expected raw material prices would increase during the year, the level of these price increases were higher than expected. Our strategic plan was adjusted accordingly during the year to account for these changes in market conditions. We made a conscious decision not to raise our prices through Fiscal Year 2018, but in September 2018 we were forced to finally implement price increases to help offset higher costs. Despite this price increase, we expect to see continued pressure on gross margins.
We acknowledge that our long term success is directly tied to our ability to increase our revenue. Our cost control discipline has stabilized the company, but a substantial increase in company profitability can only be achieved by growing our customer base and increasing our sales per customer. During the past year we have invested in our Sales and Marketing team to enable us to broaden our reach into new markets. We continue to approach companies with larger marketing and distribution organizations about potential partnerships to increase our exposure in markets we underserve due to the size of our Sales team. We continue to see growth opportunities in our large tire (golf cart and baggage cart) and bicycle tire markets. The significant growth opportunities in these markets continue to be with large OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Our sales efforts to date in these product segments have been more successful with aftermarket tire distributors, although we continue to have discussions with OEMs regarding evaluation programs for our tires. The proliferation of bike and scooter rental companies also represents a market opportunity that we are aggressively pursuing. We continue to believe that our success in improving our market share lies in our ability to educate the marketplace about the superior value Amerityre provides relative to competitor offerings.
Our limited resources require us to continue to carefully manage our business cost drivers as well as remain selective in choosing the Research and Development programs we pursue. During the past year we developed a new elastomer formulation which provides better load bearing capability and abrasion resistance compared to our polyurethane foam formulation. We see this new elastomer as ideal for applications such as baggage carts, agricultural tires, and certain lawn mower equipment applications. Our Amerityre team is excited about the potential of this new product and we currently have customers testing this formulation in several applications. Our new product focus will continue to be developing tire solutions that address identified market needs not adequately served by current tire products. Amerityre continues to have the best flat free technology and tire products in every market segment we compete. Our success is dependent on leveraging this performance advantage to gain market share among customers who value quality and premium tire performance.
We expect this upcoming year to continue to be challenging for Amerityre. It is too early to determine the impact of the new tariffs being levied against China will have on our business. We expect that these tariffs will negatively impact our international business, and we are already paying higher prices for the wheel rims we import from overseas. Given the new tariffs being levied on U.S. agriculture products we are hesitant to call an end to the low farm income environment that has adversely impacted demand for our products in the Agricultural market. That said, we expect that our competitors who solely import their tires from China will also have challenges going forward. We remain optimistic that our product performance and quality advantages over competitor offerings will enable us to grow our customer base during the upcoming year.
I appreciate the efforts of our employees and the support of those shareholders who continue to support our strategy and program to establish a solidly profitable company I remain optimistic about the potential of Amerityre going forward, and I thank you for your patience as we continue to work toward the success of Amerityre. I encourage you all to attend the Annual Meeting this year to meet our team and to see firsthand the improvements in our company.

The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board oversees the Company's risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk. At least annually, the full Board reviews strategic risks and opportunities facing the Company. Certain other important categories of risk are assigned to the committees below (which are comprised mostly of independent directors) that report back to the full Board. In general, the committees oversee the following risks:
- The Audit Committee oversees risks related to financial controls, capital structure of the enterprise (including borrowing, liquidity, allocation of capital, major capital transactions and expenditures), legal, regulatory and compliance risks, and the overall risk management governance structure and risk management function.
- The Compensation Committee oversees the Company's compensation programs to ensure they do not incentivize excessive risk-taking.
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 the full Board received reports from management on the most important strategic issues and risks facing the Company, as well as, reports regarding enterprise risk assessments and risk management practices.
The Board believes that its leadership structure supports the risk oversight function.  Additionally, as indicated above, certain important categories of risk are assigned to committees, consisting of mostly independent directors that receive, review and evaluate management reports on risk, thereby preserving the benefit of independent risk oversight along with full Board responsibility and review.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 
APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES AUTHORIZED
FROM 75,000,000 SHARES TO 100,000,000 SHARES
At our 2014 Annual Stockholder's Meeting, and as reiterated at each Annual Stockholder's meeting thereafter, we presented a plan focusing on "Profitability as a Mindset".  The result of our emphasis on proper product pricing and new marketing campaigns resulted in our first ever, full year, reporting of Net Income in Fiscal Year 2017.  However, due to limited available resources the Company has not made major investments to strengthen its market presence or to upgrade production equipment or facilities to support the production of its evolving product portfolio.
The Company currently is authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock. As of the September 30, 2018, there are 45,632,142 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 71,944,000 common stock equivalents consisting of outstanding common stock, stock option plans, conversion features of the Company's Preferred Stock and vesting stock awards.
The Board of Directors believes that it might be necessary in the future to raise additional funds through an equity issue to take advantage of potential market opportunities and grow revenues to a level where the Company is consistently profitable and further self-sustaining.  As shares of Amerityre are currently trading at approximately $0.02 per share, an issuance of 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 common shares would result in an equity raise between $400,000 and $600,000.  However, currently there are only approximately 700,000 shares available for issuance.
 Our common shareholders approved an identical measure last year but our Preferred Shareholder did not give their approval, so the proposal was not implemented. We are asking our common shareholders to re-approve the proposal. Concurrent with this year's shareholder proposal, the Company is working again with its Preferred Shareholder to obtain the necessary written approval also required per the Preferred Share Agreement for the share increase.  Should the shareholders approve the increase but the Preferred Shareholder not approve the increase, the Company will not increase the authorized shares of the Company until such time as the Preferred Shareholder approval can be attained.
The company has no immediate plans to utilize these additional shares, and given the currently low price of Amerityre stock the company is hesitant to conduct an equity financing at this time. However, having these shares approved will enable the company to move quickly to take advantage of potential opportunities should the right opportunity present itself. Specifically, we expect that additional capital would be required in the future for the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Upgrade manufacturing equipment to support new manufacturing technologies;  
● Hire additional sales representatives; and,  
● Working capital.  
[END TABLE]
It is the Board's determination that there is insufficient authorized common stock remaining to raise the necessary capital for the above initiatives.   The Board of Directors unanimously recommends increasing the authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 100,000,000 shares.  This action is being recommended to provide the Company with additional equity to invest in initiatives to support revenue growth to make Amerityre consistently profitable and self-sustaining.
Reasons to Approve the Increase in Authorized Shares
At the end of 2016, we were able to obtain term bank debt financing to finance critical manufacturing equipment and operating enhancements which will be placed in service in early fiscal year 2017.  In 2018, we used our internally generated cash resources to invest in the Company. Management continues to evaluate financing options but is choosing to delay financing at terms that will subject the Company to high costs of debt. Management is also reluctant to raise money through stock sales at what we believe are highly dilutive share prices.  Additionally, Management has notified our preferred shareholder that we have suspended future payments of their preferred cash dividend payments to allow the Company to increase its working capital levels.  A discussion of these efforts can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's June 30, 2018 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 14, 2018. Even with these efforts, the Company has not had the ability to invest to support revenue growth at a level that would make the Company consistently profitable and self-sustaining. Therefore, the Board believes it is not only prudent, but crucial, to have additional equity capital available for use by the Company.
At September 12, 2018, our total cash balance was $283,329, none of which is restricted; accounts receivables were $246,385; and inventory, net of reserves for slow moving or obsolete inventory, and other current assets was $591,788. Our total indebtedness was $447,734 and includes $230,250 in accounts payable, $72,227 in accrued expenses, $23,899 in deferred revenue, $19,042 in current portion of long-term debt, and $40,001 in long-term debt.
We have been working to improve our liquidity and access to capital resources. In order to fully execute the strategic business plan, we required more capital resources. However, management decided that an equity financing at the current market conditions would be too dilutive and not in the best interests of shareholders. We will continue to investigate potential opportunities to secure short-term loans, long-term bank financing, revolving lines of credit with banking institutions and equity based transactions with interested financial firms and strategic industry partners in our effort to improve the Company's financial position and enhance shareholder value.
The Company currently does not have an existing revolving credit facility but we were able to obtain term bank debt financing at the end of 2016 to finance critical manufacturing equipment and operating enhancements, the majority of which was placed in service in fiscal year 2017. We continue to work with our vendors to obtain extended credit terms and increase credit lines where needed. Additionally, we continue to focus on adherence to established collection policies and proactive communication with repeat customers, including adjusting credit limits to allow for increased sales volume where warranted.
We are intent on focusing on the sale and distribution of profitable product lines. Management continues to look for further financing facilities at affordable terms that will allow the Company to maintain sufficient raw material and finished goods inventory to capitalize on sales growth opportunities. We are limiting our capital expenditures to that required to maintain current manufacturing capability or support key business initiatives identified in our strategic sales plan.  We continue to work to reduce our overall costs wherever possible.
The issuance of the additional shares will cause some dilution to current shareholders, but we anticipate that the opportunity to increase Company revenue and profitability would generate additional shareholder value that would more than offset the effects of any dilution.
Effects of the Increase in Authorized Shares
The Company currently is authorized to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par value common stock. As of the September 30, 2018, there are 45,632,142 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 71,944,000 common stock equivalents consisting of outstanding comment stock, stock option plans, conversion features of the Company's Preferred Stock and vesting stock awards.  Following approval of the requested increase in common shares, we will have approximately 25,700,000 shares authorized and available for issuance. 
Currently we do not have any arrangements or understandings for the remaining portion of the authorized but unissued shares, although management has had preliminary discussions with financial institutions about obtaining additional capital via equity financing to grow revenues to a level at which the Company is solidly profitable and self-sustaining.  It is the opinion of Amerityre management that the approximately 700,000 currently authorized but unissued shares are insufficient, given the current price of AMTY common shares.
If approved, the additional authorized but unissued and unreserved shares of our common stock could be issued by the board without further shareholder approval. It is our present intention to issue additional shares (1) fund revenue growth initiatives and (2) enhance our manufacturing capabilities as identified above.  
Exchange Act Matters
Our common stock is registered under the Exchange Act, and we are subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. Any increase in authorized capital, if implemented, will not affect the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act or our reporting or other requirements. Our common stock is currently quoted, and following any increase will continue to be quoted, on the OTCQB Marketplace. We do not expect that our common stock will be traded under a new symbol, nor do we expect that the CUSIP number for our common stock will change. Any increase in authorized common stock will be reflected on new certificates issued by the Company and in electronic entry systems but will not otherwise affect outstanding shares.
Accounting Matters
The increase in authorized shares will not affect total shareholders' equity on our balance sheet.
Tax Consequences
To our best knowledge, any increase in our authorized shares will have no tax consequences for our shareholders.
Effect of Not Obtaining the Required Vote for Approval
If the increase in authorized shares is not approved, our ability to continue operations and pursue business opportunities might be severely limited. We might be unable to meet our obligations, or raise additional funds to meet future obligations. Our ability to raise additional funds will be severely constrained, and, without funding, we may not have sufficient remaining equity to retain officers, directors and employees, or engage necessary consultants.
Procedure for Effecting the Increase in Authorized Shares
The increase will become effective as of the date of filing the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada, with such date being referred to as the "effective time." The form of the Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation is included below:

Vote Required
Approval of the increase in authorized shares of the Company's common stock  requires the approval of a majority of the voting power represented by shares at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, assuming that a quorum is present or represented at the Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the increase from 75,000,000 authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. It is intended that in the absence of contrary specifications, proxies will be voted for the increase. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be counted in the vote for the increase.
PROPOSAL NO. 4
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
In accordance with the SEC's proxy rules, we are seeking an advisory, non-binding stockholder vote with respect to the compensation of the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement for fiscal year 2018 and as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. This vote is commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote.
We believe that our compensation programs and policies for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were  effective  in aligning  the Company's developmental goals with shareholder interests,  and remain worthy of continued stockholder support. Accordingly, we ask for our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation paid to the named executive officers by voting FOR the following non-binding resolution at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 listed in the Summary Compensation Table in the 'Executive Compensation' section of the proxy statement and as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K."
Vote Required
Approval of this proposal requires that votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast against the proposal. Your vote is advisory and the result is not binding upon the Company. Although not binding, our Board values the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote, along with other relevant factors, in deciding whether any actions are necessary to address any concerns raised by the vote and when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers. The Board recommends that the stockholders vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers, as stated in the above non-binding resolutions.  It is intended that in the absence of contrary specifications, proxies will be voted for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers.  Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be counted in the advisory vote for the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers.
PROPOSAL NO. 5
 ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF VOTING ON THE
COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
In addition to the Say-on-Pay advisory vote, we are seeking an advisory, non-binding vote regarding the frequency of future advisory Say-on-Pay votes in accordance with the SEC's proxy rules, known as a "Say-on-Pay Frequency" advisory vote.
Stockholders will be able to vote that we hold this Say-on-Pay advisory vote every year, two years, or three years, or stockholders may abstain from voting on this proposal.
After due consideration, the Board has decided to recommend that this Say-on-Pay advisory vote on executive compensation occur every three years. While there are valid arguments for annual and biennial votes, we believe that a vote once every three years is the best approach for the Company and its stockholders for a number of reasons, including that a triennial vote will allow our stockholders to better evaluate our executive compensation program in relation to our short- and long-term company performance. Additionally, a triennial vote will provide us with time to respond to stockholder concerns and implement appropriate revisions.
The Board's decision was based further on the premise that this recommendation could be modified in future years if it becomes apparent that a vote once every three years is not meaningful or a more frequent vote is recommended by best corporate governance practices.
Vote Required
The frequency (one year, two years or three years) that receives the highest number of votes cast by the stockholders will be deemed the frequency for the advisory Say-on-Pay vote preferred by the stockholders. Your vote is advisory and the results are not binding upon the Company. Although not binding, the Board values the opinions of our stockholders and will review and consider the outcome of the vote, along with other relevant factors, in evaluating the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The Board recommends that stockholders vote for the option of "THREE YEARS" as the preference for the frequency of holding future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers.  It is intended that in the absence of contrary specifications, proxies will be voted for the approval of three years for the frequency of advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.  Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be counted in the advisory vote on the frequency of approval of the compensation of the named executive officers.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the duties, responsibilities and role of our Compensation Committee as well as the material elements of compensation for the our executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table set forth below (the "Named Executive Officers").  Over the past year, the Compensation Committee has reviewed our compensation practices and the components of executive compensation.  The information below provides the description of compensation policies applicable to executive officers and other highly compensated individuals under employment and/or consulting arrangements.
Objectives of Our Compensation Program
The primary objective of our compensation program, including our executive compensation program, is to: maintain a compensation program that will fairly compensate our executives and employees; attract and retain qualified executives and employees, who are able to contribute to our long-term success; encourage performance consistent with clearly defined corporate goals; and align our executives' long-term interests with those of our stockholders. To that end, our compensation practices are intended to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.     Tie total compensation to the Company's performance and individual performance in achieving financial and non-financial objectives;  
 2.     Align senior management's interests with stockholders' interests through long-term equity incentive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, our other executive officers. In addition, the Compensation Committee is responsible for adopting, reviewing and administering our compensation policies and programs, including the cash bonus incentive plan and equity incentive plans, which are discussed in more detail below. Our Compensation Committee adheres to a compensation philosophy that (i) seeks to attract and retain qualified executives who will add to the long-term success of the Company, (ii) promotes the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, and (iii) compensates executives commensurate with each executive's level of performance, level of responsibility and overall contribution to the success of the Company.
In determining the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers the financial condition and operational performance of the Company during the prior year. In determining the compensation for executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and comparable market rates.
 The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation practices of other companies, based in part on market survey data and other statistical data relating to executive compensation obtained through industry publications and other sources. The Compensation Committee does not seek to benchmark the Company's compensation program directly with other publicly traded companies or other companies with which we may compete for potential executives, since some of these competitors are privately held companies for which executive compensation information is not available.
Components of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017
The elements of the Company's current compensation program are base salary and long-term equity incentives. Our compensation program is designed to provide our executives with incentives to achieve our short-term and long-term performance goals and to pay competitive base salaries. Each Named Executive Officer's current and prior compensation is considered in setting future compensation.
Each of the elements of our executive compensation program is discussed in the following paragraphs.
Base Salaries
Base salaries are based on a number of factors, including the executive's experience level and scope of responsibility, performance level, estimate of future potential and overall contribution. The value of base salary also reflects the employee's long-term performance, skill set and the market value of that skill set. Base salaries for our Named Executive Officers and other highly compensated individuals are reviewed on an annual basis and adjustments made to reflect performance-based factors, as well as competitive conditions. The Company does not apply specific formulas in setting base salaries.
Long Term Equity Incentives
Long term incentive awards are a key element of the Company's total compensation package for individuals in significant positions of responsibility. Such awards may be made under the 2017 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan (the "2017 Plan") to senior management and select employees who are key to the Company's achievement of its long-term goals. The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to promote the long term growth and profitability of Amerityre by (i) providing certain officers and employees with incentives to maximize stockholder value, and (ii) enabling Amerityre to attract, retain and reward the best available persons for positions of responsibility. The 2017 Plan provides for a variety of long-term awards including incentive or non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and performance awards.
The Plan is administered by the Board unless and until the Board delegates administration to the Committee as defined by the 2017 Plan. Awards granted under the 2017 Plan may be incentive stock options, or ISOs, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, or stock bonus awards which are awarded to our employees, including officers, who, in the opinion of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, have contributed, or are expected to contribute, materially to our success.
All of our employees and officers are eligible to participate under the 2017 Plan.  A maximum of 3,000,000 shares are available for grant under the 2017 Plan. Under the 2017 Plan, the Board and the Compensation Committee have broad authority to award equity-based compensation arrangements to any eligible employee, director, consultant, or advisor of Amerityre.
Perquisites and Other Benefits
The Company does not provide significant perquisites or personal benefits to executive officers different from those of non-executive employees.
Employment Agreements
On September 26, 2018, Michael F. Sullivan, the Company's Chief Executive Officer finalized the negotiation of the replacement and extension of his employment contract.
The Agreement replaces the current employment agreement and extends his term of employment to December 31, 2019.
Mr. Sullivan's compensation package is a summarized below.  See the full agreement as filed as Exhibit 10.1 for Form 8-k, which was filed on October 2, 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation.  
[END TABLE]
(a)     Annual salary of $150,000 per year
(b)     Stock award of 1.98 million shares of the Company's common stock vesting ratably during the calendar year of 2019;
(c)     Bonus compensation up to twenty (20)% of annual salary under Section 5(a) based on certain financial performance objectives as described in Section 5(c ); and,
(d)     Health and medical insurance as available for full-time employees, and participation in any retirement, pension, profit-sharing, stock option, or other plan as in effect from time to time on the same basis as other employees.
Lynda R. Keeton-Cardno, who devotes approximately 25% of her time to the Company, receives an annual salary of $36,000, renegotiable yearly.  In January 2018, Ms. Keeton-Cardno's employment agreement was extended for 1 year with the annual compensation increasing from $28,986.10 to $36,000, respectively. With the January 2018 extension, 60,000 stock aware was granted, valued at $0.02 per share, vesting ratably January 2018 through December 2018.  All other terms remain the same.
The Compensation Committee, at its discretion, may award bonuses to the executive officers of the organization in addition to the terms of the above employment contract. For the year ended June 30, 2018 the following bonuses were awarded:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Michael F. Sullivan: $7,500 payable in cash; $7,500 payable in stock (representing 375,000 share of stock).  
● Lynda R. Keeton-Cardno: $5,000 payable in cash.  
[END TABLE]
Employee Benefits
The Company offers employee health insurance benefits coverage to provide our workforce with a reasonable level of financial support in the event of illness or injury. Health insurance benefits are available to all full time employees, including executive officers of the Company. The executive officers of the Company, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible on the same basis as all other employees. Due to the changes in health and dental costs in association with federal laws, the cost of employee benefits is contributory where the Company contributes a maximum of $575 toward each eligible employee's benefits and any remaining amount is borne by the employee. This amount was adjusted to $625 effective September 1, 2018 due to increase health insurance costs.
Accounting Matters
The Company has adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation (ASC 718), formerly SFAS 123(R), which requires the fair value of options to be recorded as compensation cost in the financial statements. The adoption of ASC 718 has resulted in $28,792 and $27,807 in stock based compensation costs recognized in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Stock Option and Stock Bonus Awards
General Option Information
On August 10, 2015, the Board of Directors cancelled the "Directors' 2011 Stock Option and Award Plan" as all options under this plan had been granted and adopted the "2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" which contains provisions for up to 3,000,000 stock options to be granted to employees, consultants and directors.  The 2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan did not obtain the necessary shareholder approval in the Company's annual proxy process, resulting in certain U.S. Internal Revenue Service provisions to be ineffective.
On April 25, 2017, the Board of Directors cancelled the "2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" as all options and stock awards under this plan had been granted and adopted the "2017 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" which contains provisions for up to 3,000,000 stock options to be granted to employees, consultants and directors.
Prior Issuances of options
On December 1, 2016, 480,000 options were granted to the Company's Chief Executive Officer as part of his employment offer.  The options have a strike price of $0.10, vest December 1, 2017 and expire December 1, 2020.  Year to date expense related to these options is $1,021 as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, $729 in expense was related to this issuance.
Expense related to the above options is $16,097 as of June 30, 2017.
As of June 30, 2017, there was $729 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options that will be recognized over the vest period (December 2017) of the underlying option.
Option issuances and vesting during the period ending June 30, 2018 and 2017
No stock options were issued in fiscal year 2018.
Stock Ownership Requirements
The Board of Directors has historically encouraged its members and members of senior management to acquire and maintain stock in the Company to link the interests of such persons to the stockholders. However, neither the Board of Directors nor the Compensation Committee has established stock ownership guidelines for members of the Board of Directors or the executive officers of the Company.
Compensation Committee Report On Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee, comprised of independent and non-independent directors, reviewed and discussed the above Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") with the Company's management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A relating to the upcoming annual meeting and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Incentive Plan
On August 10, 2015, the Board of Directors cancelled the "Directors' 2011 Stock Option and Award Plan" as all options under this plan had been granted and adopted the "2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" which contains provisions for up to 3,000,000 stock options to be granted to employees, consultants and directors.  The 2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan did not obtain the necessary shareholder approval in the Company's annual proxy process, resulting in certain U.S. Internal Revenue Service provisions to be ineffective.
In the October 2015 Board meeting, the Board granted all non-executive Board members 100,000 options, with the audit committee chair receiving an additional 50,000 options, for Board services rendered for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.  The options have a strike price of $0.10, vest at the end of the Board term on December 3, 2015 and expire December 3, 2017.  
On January 19, 2016, the Board granted all non-executive Board members 100,000 options, with the audit committee chair receiving an additional 50,000 options, for Board services rendered for the Board term ending December 2016.  The options have a strike price of $0.10, vest at the end of the Board term in December 2016 and expire December 2019.  
As of January 31, 2017, 225,000 shares were granted to the Company's Board of Director's as Board compensation for the term ending November 2017.  Each non-executive Board member receives 50,000 shares, with the Audit Committee Chair receiving 75,000 shares.  The shares vest ratably January – December 2017, valued at a fixed rate of $0.0155, the closing stock price on January 31, 2017.  All shares related to this have been issued.
On April 25, 2017, the Board of Directors cancelled the "2015 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" as all options and stock awards under this plan had been granted and adopted the "2017 Omnibus Stock Option and Award Plan" which contains provisions for up to 3,000,000 stock options to be granted to employees, consultants and directors.
On November 30, 2017, 265,000 shares were granted to the Company's Board of Directors as Board compensation for the term ending November 2018.  Each non-executive Board member receives 60,000 shares, with the Audit Committee Chair receiving 85,000 shares.  The shares vest ratably December 2017 – November 2018, valued at a fixed rate of $0.02, the closing stock price on November 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, 132,500 shares of stock have been issued.
In the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation or any other change in our corporate structure affecting common stock, or a sale by us of all or a substantial part of its assets, or any distribution to stockholders other than a cash dividend, our Board of Directors will make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of shares authorized by the 2017 Plan, and any adjustments to outstanding awards as it deems appropriate.  However, no fractional shares of common stock will be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and the fair market value of any fractional shares resulting from adjustments will be paid in cash to the awardee.
All options and restricted stock granted to an awardee shall automatically terminate and be null and void as of the date an eligible Director's service on the Board of Directors terminates if the directorship is terminated as a result of any act of (a) fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or (b) embezzlement, misappropriation, or conversion of assets or opportunities of our company.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS,
AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, Michael F. Sullivan acted as both CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.  No other Board member received compensation outside of the Board of Director options/stock awards disclosed in the compensation disclosure and tables above.
As of this filing, Mr. Sullivan is not deemed independent as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, because of his involvement as officers or employees of the Company.
Director's Terry Gilland, George Stoddard, David Clark and David Hollister, are deemed to be independent under the definition of independence per NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2), which standard for independence has been adopted by the Company.  In addition, these directors meets the additional requirements for audit committee members under NASDAQ Rule 5605(c), including meeting the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Act (subject to the exemptions provided in Rule 10A-3(c) under the Act), not having participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past three years, and being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including the Company's balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. See compensation tables above.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
Common stock
The following tables set forth as of September 30, 2018, the name and address and the number of shares of our Common Stock held of record or beneficially by each person who held of record, or was known by us to own beneficially, more than 5 percent of our issued and outstanding common stock, and the name and shareholdings of each director and of all officers and directors as a group. The information on share numbers and percentage ownership listed assumes: a) the exercise of options by the beneficial owner (all included options are currently exercisable); and b) a corresponding increase in the number of shares issued and outstanding. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC.  In determining the number of shares beneficially owned by a person, options or warrants to purchase common stock held by that person that are currently exercisable, or become exercisable within 60 days following, are deemed outstanding; however, such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.  We believe that all of the persons named in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable and except as indicated in the other footnotes to this table.

   (2)   480,000 options were awarded to Mr. Sullivan in his 2/23/17 employment agreement. The options were inadvertently excluded from the option table in the Company's Form 10-K filed on September 14, 2018. The financial consequence of this was deemed both qualitatively and quantitatively immaterial by Management, but we have included these options here for full disclosure.  
[END TABLE]
FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
The Company's most recent audited financial statements and other information are contained in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending June 30, 2018. Such reports once filed, are available to stockholders on the Company's web site at http://www.amerityre.com, upon written request addressed to the Company at the Company's executive offices or on the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR website at http://www.sec.gov.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the external reporting process and the adequacy of our internal controls. Specific responsibilities of the Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, which is available on our website.
The members of the Committee are Terry Gilland, George Stoddard, and David Hollister. All meet the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
The members of the Committee reviewed and discussed with our management and Haynie & Company PC the audited financial statements contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and also discussed with Haynie & Company PC the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114 (Communications with Audit Committees), as amended. The members of the Committee received from Haynie & Company PC the written disclosures required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence.
Based on their review of our audited financial statements, and on their discussion with our management and with Haynie & Company PC, the members of the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
No proposals have been submitted by stockholders of the Company for consideration at the Annual Meeting.  It is anticipated that the next annual meeting of stockholders will be held during November 2019.  Stockholders who, in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed in connection with next year's Annual Meeting Proxy Statement must submit their proposals so that they are received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on June 30, 2019, and are otherwise in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the governing provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company.  As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included.
Stockholder proposals and director nominations for our 2019 Annual Meeting not intended for inclusion in the proxy materials for the meeting must be delivered to our principal executive offices no earlier than July 15, 2019 and no later than August 19, 2019 to be considered timely.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our Directors, executive officers and 10 percent stockholders, which we refer to as reporting persons, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our common stock.  Reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.  To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received or written representations from certain reporting persons that no other reports were required, we believe that during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 all reporting persons filed all such reports and that six reports were not filed timely.
CODE OF ETHICS
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all our directors, officers and employees.  A copy of the code of ethics will be provided free of charge upon written request to our Secretary at the address shown on the cover page of this proxy statement and is accessible, free of charge at our website, www.amerityre.com.  If we grant waivers from or make amendments to this code of ethics that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the Exchange Act or applicable listing requirements, we will make those disclosures on our website within four business days following the date of such waiver or amendment.
STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME LAST NAME AND ADDRESS
In accordance with notices that we sent to certain stockholders, we are sending only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement to stockholders who share the same last name and address, unless they have notified us that they want to continue receiving multiple copies. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs as well as natural resources.
If you received a household mailing this year and you would like to have additional copies of our annual report and/or proxy statement mailed to you, or you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings, please submit your request by mail to Amerityre Corporation, 1501 Industrial Road, Boulder City, Nevada 89005. We will promptly send additional copies of the annual report and/or proxy statement upon receipt of such request. You may also contact us if you received multiple copies of the annual meeting materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future.
Unfortunately, householding for bank and brokerage accounts is limited to accounts within the same bank or brokerage firm. For example, if you and your spouse share the same last name and address, and you and your spouse each have two accounts containing Amerityre stock at two different brokerage firms, your household will receive two copies of our annual meeting materials—one from each brokerage firm.
OTHER MATTERS
Management does not know of any business other than referred to in the Notice which may be considered at the meeting.  If any other matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, such matters will be properly addressed and resolved and those in attendance will vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
