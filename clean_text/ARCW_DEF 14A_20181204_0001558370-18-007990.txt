QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the matters to be addressed at the Annual Meeting.  These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as an ARC shareholder.  Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement and the documents referred to in this Proxy Statement, which you should read carefully.  See "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 30.
Except as otherwise noted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· References in this Proxy Statement to "ARC," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to the business of ARC Group Worldwide, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
[END TABLE]
Q:          Why am I receiving these materials?
A:          We are providing you with this Proxy Statement in connection with the Annual Meeting of our shareholders, which will take place on December 4, 2018, starting at 11:00 AM Mountain Standard Time, at the offices of ARC Group Worldwide, Inc., 7040 Weld CR 20, Longmont, CO, 80504.  As a shareholder, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.
Q:          What am I being asked to vote on?
A:           You are being asked by the Board of Directors of ARC to consider and vote on the following matters:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The election of the five nominees as directors whose names are set forth on the proxy card to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of shareholders or until their respective successors have been elected and qualified, referred to in this Proxy Statement as Proposal No. 1; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP to serve as our certified independent accountants for the year ending June 30, 2019, referred to in this Proxy Statement as Proposal No. 2; 
[END TABLE]
Q:          What quorum and vote is required in connection with each of the proposals?
A:           A quorum, consisting of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock entitled to vote as of the Record Date of the Annual Meeting, must be present in person or represented by proxy before any action may be taken at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated only as shares that are present for purposes of ascertaining whether there is a quorum sufficient for the Annual Meeting to be convened and conduct the business of the meeting.
Regarding Proposal No. 1 pertaining to the election of five directors of the Company, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to elect each director.
The approval of a majority of all shares of Common Stock present and voting in person or by proxy will be required to approve Proposal No. 2. 
Q:          What happens if I do not vote?
A:          The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock entitled to vote is required for us to ascertain a quorum and convene our Annual Meeting.  If you do not vote, we may not be able to obtain a quorum to properly conduct the Annual Meeting.  If you do not wish to vote, we request that you return your proxy indicating that you consent to being present for purposes of obtaining the quorum.  In this manner, we will be able to conduct the Annual Meeting even if you do not vote your shares on any of the proposals submitted to the vote of the shareholders. Q:          What happens if I abstain?
A:           If you vote "ABSTAIN" by proxy or if you otherwise vote "ABSTAIN" at the Annual Meeting, your shares will be counted only for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will not be considered to be abstentions unless explicitly marked "abstain" and will otherwise only be present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of ascertaining a quorum.
Section 8 of Article II of the Company Bylaws provides that if a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action. Election of directors is determined by plurality voting and therefore abstentions will not have an effect on the outcome of the election of directors. Abstentions will not have an effect on the outcome of voting on any matters submitted to the vote of the shareholders.
Q:          What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A:          Many of our shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name.  As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially.
Shareholder of Record—If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares and the notice is being sent directly to you by us.  As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this Proxy Statement, if you are the shareholder of record, please submit your proxy in accordance with the instructions set forth in the proxy card so that your shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Ownership—If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares.  As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting.  However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee.  Your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed a voting instruction card with this Proxy Statement for you to use in directing such institution regarding how to vote the shares you beneficially own.
See "How to Vote Your Shares" beginning on Page 6.
Q:          If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?
A:          If your shares are held in "street name", your broker may, under certain circumstances, vote your shares.  Certain brokerage firms have authority to vote a client's unvoted shares on some "routine" matters but cannot vote a client's unvoted shares on "non-routine" matters.  If you do not give voting instructions to your broker on a "non-routine" matter, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." A broker non-vote occurs on a matter when a broker returns an executed proxy but indicates that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.  Broker non-votes are not deemed to be votes cast and, therefore, are not included in the tabulation of the voting results on these proposals.
You should instruct your broker to vote your shares.  If you do not instruct your broker, your broker may not have the authority to vote your shares for any of the proposals at the Annual Meeting.
Please check with your broker and follow the voting procedures your broker provides. Q:          How can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?
A:          Shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting.  If you choose to do so, please bring your proxy card and proof of identification to the meeting.  Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.  If you hold your shares in "street name," you must request a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee in order for you to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Q:          How can I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?
A:          If you do not plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we request that you vote your shares as promptly as possible.  You may vote electronically on the Internet, by mail by using the proxy card, or by using the toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card.  Please see "How to Vote Your Shares" on Page 6.
For shares held in "street name," you may vote your shares by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee.  A voting instruction card will be provided by your broker, bank or other nominee.
Q:          May I change my vote after I have submitted a proxy electronically, by telephone or mailed my signed proxy card?
A:          Yes.  You may change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. You can do this in several ways.  If you hold your shares as a shareholder of record, you can send a written notice stating that you want to revoke your proxy, or you can complete and submit a new proxy card, in either case dated later than the prior proxy card relating to the same shares.  You must submit your notice of revocation or your new proxy card to: ARC Group Worldwide, Inc., 810 Flightline Blvd., Deland, FL 32724, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.
You can also attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the Annual Meeting, however, will not revoke your proxy; you must vote at the Annual Meeting to revoke your proxy if you have not previously revoked your proxy.
You can also change your vote by submitting a proxy at a later date by fax or mail if you have previously voted in connection with the Annual Meeting, in which case your later-submitted proxy will be recorded and your earlier proxy revoked.
If your shares are held in "street name" and you have instructed your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, the preceding instructions do not apply, and you must follow the voting procedures received from your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.
Q:          Who can attend the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders in person?  Must I RSVP prior to the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting? 
A:          You may attend the Annual Meeting only if you are a shareholder of our Company who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, or if you hold a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting.  If you plan to attend the 2018 Annual Meeting in person, you must RSVP no later than 5:00 pm (Eastern Standard Time) on Wednesday, November 28, 2018 to InvestorRelations@arcw.com.   In order to be admitted into the Annual Meeting, your name must appear on the attendance list and you must present government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license).  Shareholders holding stock in brokerage accounts must bring a brokerage statement or other evidence of share ownership dated as of November 5, 2018, in order to be admitted to the meeting. 
Q:          If I want to attend the Annual Meeting, what do I do?
A:          If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, you must RSVP as noted above.  On December 4, 2018, the date of the Annual Meeting, you should come to the place of our Annual Meeting, located at ARC Group Worldwide, Inc., Longmont, CO, 80504 at 11:00 AM Mountain Standard Time.  Shareholders of record as of the Record Date  Table of Contents for the Annual Meeting can vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  If your shares are held in "street name," then you must ask your broker, bank or other nominee holder how you can vote at the Annual Meeting.
Q:          Do I have dissenters' or appraisal rights as a holder of ARC's Common Stock?
A:          No.  Dissenters' rights, also referred to as appraisal rights, will not be available to holders of ARC Common Stock under the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act.
Q:          Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
A:          The total expense of this solicitation will be borne by ARC. Solicitation of proxies may be made personally or by mail, Internet, e-mail or facsimile by officers and other management employees of ARC, who will receive no additional compensation for their services.
Q:          Who can help answer my additional questions about the Annual Meeting?
A:          If you have questions about the Annual Meeting and the matters to be voted upon, please contact:

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY
This summary highlights selected information also contained elsewhere in this proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") related to the matters you are being asked to vote upon and may not contain all of the information important to you.  You should read this entire document and the other documents to which this Proxy Statement refers you to fully understand the matters you are being asked to vote upon.  Each item in this summary refers to the page where that subject is hereinafter discussed in more detail.
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
Date, Time, Place and Purpose
The Annual Meeting of ARC's shareholders will be held on December 4, 2018 at 11:00 AM, Mountain Standard Time (the "Annual Meeting") at the offices of ARC Group Worldwide, Inc., Longmont, CO  80504 for the following purposes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.      To elect a Board of Directors consisting of five directors; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.      To ratify the selection of Moss Adams LLP to serve as our certified independent accountants for the year ending June 30, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Solicitation of Proxies
This Proxy Statement is provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by ARC's Board of Directors, to be voted at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.  We anticipate that notice of the Annual Meeting will be first mailed, given or otherwise provided to shareholders on or about November 8, 2018.
Under Rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have chosen to provide our shareholders with proxy materials on the Internet, rather than sending printed copies of such materials through the mail.  In connection with this decision, a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials is being mailed to our shareholders who have not previously requested electronic access to our proxy materials or paper proxy materials.  This notice contains instructions on how you may access and review our proxy materials on the Internet and how you may vote your shares.  The notice also contains information concerning how to request our proxy materials in printed form or by e-mail, at no charge.  If you hold shares of our Common Stock in "street name" through a broker, rather than directly in your own name, you should contact your broker to request paper proxy packages.
If you hold shares beneficially in "street name" and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." A broker non-vote occurs on a matter where a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given.  In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered votes cast on that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained.  In particular, please note that brokers may not vote your shares on certain matters in the absence of your specific instructions as to how to vote, so we encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares.
A shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by delivering written notice of revocation to our Chief Executive Officer, by substituting a new proxy executed at a later date, or by requesting, in person at the Annual Meeting, that the proxy be returned.  Shareholders do not have dissenters' rights of appraisal for any action proposed to be taken at the Annual Meeting.  The solicitation of proxies by the Company is to be made by mail, telephone and oral communications with shareholders.  Our officers, directors and employees may solicit proxies, but these persons  Table of Contents will not receive compensation for that solicitation other than their regular compensation. Arrangements also will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to beneficial owners of the shares held of record by those persons.  We may reimburse those persons for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in so doing.  We will pay all expenses involved in preparing, assembling and mailing this Proxy Statement and the enclosed material.
Record Date, Shares Outstanding and Entitled to Vote
The close of business on November 5, 2018 has been fixed as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of holders of record of the Company's Common Stock, $.0005 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), entitled to notice and to vote at the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, 23,349,478 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Each share, unless otherwise set forth herein, is entitled to one vote.  A majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, represented either in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at any meeting of the shareholders.  If a quorum of votes has not been received prior to the meeting date, we intend to postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting in order to solicit additional votes.  At any postponed or adjourned meeting, we will vote any proxies received in the same manner described in this Proxy Statement with respect to the original meeting.
How to Vote Your Shares
We will send a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to all shareholders of record as of the Record Date for the Annual Meeting.  The Notice will give you the opportunity to request a set of printed proxy materials, and you will be sent proxy materials if you request them.  That set of printed proxy materials will also include a proxy card.
You are encouraged to review our Proxy Statement and Annual Report before you cast your vote.

[Proxy Statement Continues on Following Page] PROPOSAL NO. 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The terms of the current directors expire upon the election and qualification of the directors to be elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors has nominated five persons for election at the Annual Meeting to serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
The directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast (which means that the nominees who receive the most affirmative votes will be elected to serve as directors).  Cumulative voting is not permitted in the election of directors.  Each record holder of stock shall be entitled to vote in the election of directors and shall have as many votes for each of the shares owned by him or her as there are directors to be elected and for whose election he or she has the right to vote.  As a result, a shareholder may vote all of his or her shares for each nominee, but may not cumulate the votes to vote more than the total number of shares owned for any one nominee.  In the absence of instructions to the contrary, the person named in the accompanying proxy shall vote the shares represented by that proxy for the persons named below as the Board of Directors' nominees for directors.  Each of the nominees currently is a director of the Company.
Each of the nominees has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve on the Board of Directors if elected.  It is not anticipated that any of the nominees will become unable or unwilling to accept his nomination or election, but, if that should occur, the persons named in the proxy intend to vote for the election of such other person as the Board of Directors may recommend.
The following table sets forth, with respect to each nominee for director, the nominee's age (as of the date of the filing), his position(s) and office(s) with the Company, and the year in which he first became a director.  Individual background information concerning each of the nominees follows the table, as well as a brief discussion of the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the conclusion that such individual should be nominated.  For additional information concerning the nominees, including stock ownership and compensation, see "Executive Compensation," "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management," and "Certain Transactions with Management and Principal Shareholders."

Audit Committee Report
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process.  The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board - United States ("PCAOB") and to issue a report thereon.  The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and to engage and discharge the Company's auditors.  It is not our duty or our responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures.  We may not be, and we may not represent ourselves to be or to serve as, accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing.  Therefore, we have relied, without independent verification, on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and on the representations of the independent auditors included in the report on the Company's financial statements.  Our oversight does not provide us with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.  Furthermore, our considerations and discussions with management and the independent auditors do not assure that the Company's financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  Table of Contents that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with auditing standards of the PCAOB, or that the Company's independent accountants are in fact "independent."
In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions separately with management and the independent accountants.  Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management and the independent accountants.  Management concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at June 30, 2018 and the identification of a material weakness in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.  The Audit Committee discussed with the independent accountants matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard 16, regarding communications with audit committees.
The Company's independent accountants also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosure required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence.  The Committee discussed with the independent accountants that firm's independence.  No non-audit services were provided by the Company's independent accountants in the year ended June 30, 2018. 
Based on the Audit Committee's discussion with management and the independent accountants, and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of the management and the report of the independent accounts to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 filed with the SEC.

[Proxy Statement Continues on Following Page] EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis addresses the aspects of our compensation programs and explains our compensation philosophy, policies, and practices, with respect to our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which we collectively refer to as our Named Executive Officers.
Oversight of Executive Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our executive compensation programs.  Each member of the Compensation Committee is an "independent director" as defined by the federal securities laws and in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.  The Compensation Committee is empowered to advise management and make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to the compensation and other employment benefits of executive officers and key employees of the Company.  The various components of the compensation programs for executive officers are discussed below in "Elements of Executive Compensation Program." 
Objectives of Executive Compensation and What the Programs are Designed to Reward
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to integrate compensation with the achievement of our short-term and long-term business objectives and to assist us in attracting, motivating and retaining the highest quality executive officers and rewarding them for superior performance. 
We believe that the compensation of our executive officers should reflect their success in attaining key operating objectives, such as growth, maintenance of market position, development of new products, maintenance and development of customer relationships and long-term competitive advantage.  We also believe that executive compensation should reflect achievement of individual goals established for specific executive officers, as well as specific achievements by such individuals over the course of the year such as development of specific products or customer relationships or agreements or executing or integrating acquisitions and strategic arrangements.  
Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee did not utilize the services of a compensation consultant in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, as the Compensation Committee believed that there was no current need for the services of such consultant with respect to review, assessment and determinations of Company executive compensation. 
Elements of Executive Compensation Program
Compensation elements include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· base salary; 
· annual cash or equity incentive awards; 
· long-term equity incentive compensation; and 
· other health, welfare and pension benefits. 
[END TABLE]
Base Salary
Base salary is designed to provide competitive levels of base compensation to our executives based on their experience, duties and scope of responsibilities.  We pay base salaries because it provides a base compensation that is required to recruit and retain executives of the quality that we must employ to ensure the success of our Company. Annual Cash or Equity Incentive Awards
Annual incentive compensation is designed to provide competitive levels of compensation based on experience, duties and scope of responsibilities.  Incentive awards are influenced by the Company's profitability and achievement of planned profitability, as well as other factors. The awards are also intended to promote executive retention, as unvested stock options are generally forfeited if the executive voluntarily leaves the Company.
Through our market-based stock option awards, we seek to align the interests of the named executive officers with those of our shareholders and provide each individual with a significant incentive to manage the Company from the perspective of an owner.  In order to vest in the market-based stock options, the Company's stock price is required to double by December 31, 2018 to $8.80 per share from the grant date price of $4.40 per share on February 10, 2017.  The size of the option grant to each executive officer is generally set at a level that is intended to create a meaningful opportunity for share ownership based on the individual's current position with the Company.  The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration the individual's potential for future responsibility and promotion, the individual's performance in recent periods, and the number of options held by the individual on the date of grant.  Further, the Compensation Committee considers overall shareholder dilution when determining the size of the equity awards.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
The Compensation Committee does not have a regular schedule for awarding equity-based compensation and the timing of such awards is subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee.  We do not backdate options or grant options retroactively or stock options with a so-called "reload" feature.  In addition, we do not plan to coordinate grants of options so that they are made before the announcement of favorable information, or after the announcement of unfavorable information.  
Other Health, Welfare and Retirement Benefits
Employees may participate in our health and welfare benefit programs, including medical, dental and vision care coverage, disability insurance, and life insurance.  We provide these benefits to meet the health and welfare needs of employees and their families.
401(k) Plan
The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan and matches employee contributions as determined by Company management.  Our executives are also eligible for the Company matches, subject to regulatory limits on contributions to 401(k) plans.
We do not currently provide pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executives or employees, although we may consider such benefits in the future.  In addition, we do not provide any nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plans, although we may consider such benefits in the future.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") for eligible executives and employees.  Executives and employees may authorize payroll deductions up to 10% of their base pay to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price at the beginning or end of each six-month purchase period, subject to regulatory limits.
Employment Agreements and Other Post-Employment Payments
Effective at the close of business on June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Jason T. Young, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, in connection with Mr. Young's separation from the Company.  The agreement was negotiated with Mr. Young, and the Compensation Committee determined that the payments and benefits under the separation agreement were appropriate in light of his service to the Company.  Pursuant  Table of Contents to the separation agreement, following the termination of Mr. Young's employment at the close of business on June 30, 2017, the Company agreed to provide the following severance payments and benefits to Mr. Young: (i) severance of $110,000, payable incrementally monthly over twelve months commencing July 1, 2017, (ii) continuation of health and related insurance through December 31, 2017, and (iii) at Mr. Young's election, the extention of the exercise period for his vested stock options for five years (in lieu of 90 days otherwise required for exercise following the termination of employment). 
Effective July 1, 2017, Drew M. Kelley was appointed to the position of Interim Chief Executive Officer.  On the same date, Mr. Kelley was also appointed to serve as a director on the Board of Directors. The Company was not party to a written employment agreement with Mr. Kelley.    During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, Mr. Kelley's annual salary was $300,000.  Mr. Kelley received a bonus of $100,000 with respect to such fiscal year.  The annual base salary of Mr. Kelley for his services as an officer of the Company for the 2018 fiscal year was $340,000.  Effective May 10, 2018, Mr. Kelley resigned from the Company.  As such, he was not eligible for a discretionary bonus for the fiscal year 2018.  Mr. Kelley did not receive separate or additional fees with respect to his services rendered as a director on the Board of Directors. 
Tax Implications of Executive Compensation
We do not currently intend to award compensation that would result in a limitation on the deductibility of a portion of such compensation pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; however, we may in the future decide to authorize other compensation in excess of the limits of Section 162(m) if it determines that such compensation is in the best interests of the Company.
Although deductibility of compensation is preferred, tax deductibility is not a primary objective of our compensation programs.  We believe that achieving our compensation objectives set forth above is more important than the benefit of tax deductibility and we reserve the right to maintain flexibility in how we compensate our executive officers that may result in limiting the deductibility of amounts of compensation from time to time.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.
 Submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors:

Certain Transactions with Management and Principal Shareholders
We do not employ specific written procedures for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions involving our directors, officers and employees or their family members, but we consider such transactions on a case-by-case basis.  The Company requires that any material related party transactions be disclosed to the independent directors of  Table of Contents the Board of Directors who shall review and assess the fairness of such transactions without the participation in the deliberation or voting of any interested parties.  The Board of Directors follows fiduciary standards mandated under state law when considering all such matters. 
During the past two fiscal years, and subsequent to such period, the Company has been involved with the following related party matters with certain members of management and certain shareholders.
Everest Hill Group Inc. ("Everest Hill Group") owns approximately 52.7% of the shares of ARC.  Everest Hill Group also owns Quadrant Management, Inc. ("QMI").  Mr. Alan Quasha is affiliated with QMI as Chairman and Mr. Eli Davidai is affiliated with QMI as a Managing Director.  Prior to his resignation on June 30, 2017, Mr. Jason T. Young served as Managing Director of QMI.   None of Mr. Alan Quasha, Mr. Eli Davidai nor Mr. Jason Young possess any voting power or powers of disposition over any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Everest Hill Group.  Mr. Alan Quasha serves on the Board of Directors of the Company and the board of directors of ARC subsidiary Quadrant Metals Technologies LLC ("QMT").  Mr. Eli Davidai serves on the Board of Directors of the Company.  Prior to his resignation on June 30, 2017, Mr. Jason Young also served on the Board of Directors of the Company and the board of directors of QMT. Mr. Alan Quasha has elected not to receive any compensation for his serving as a member of the Board of Directors for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and no compensation for serving as CEO for the period May 3, 2018 through June 30, 2018 related to fiscal year 2018.   In addition to fees paid in consideration for his services as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company commencing in fiscal 2016, Mr. Alan Quasha received no fees for his services on the board of QMT with respect to fiscal years 2017 and 2018, respectively.  In addition to fees paid in consideration for his services as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and his executive compensation, Mr. Jason Young received no compensation for his services on the board of QMT during fiscal year 2017. 
On November 7, 2014 (the "Closing Date"), the Company and its subsidiaries AFT, ARC Wireless, Inc., Flomet LLC, General Flange & Forge LLC, Tekna Seal LLC, 3D Material Technologies, LLC, and QMT, entered into a subordinated term loan credit agreement, together with McLarty Capital Partners SBIC, L.P. ("McLarty Capital"), as administrative agent, and other lenders from time to time party thereto (the "Subordinated Loan Agreement"), regarding an extension of credit in the form of a subordinated term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $20,000,000.  The subordinated term loan under the Subordinated Loan Agreement will mature five years after the Closing Date.  The interest rate set forth in the Subordinated Loan Agreement is 11.00% per annum.  Upon an event of default under the Subordinated Loan Agreement, the interest rate increases automatically by 2.00% per annum.  The Subordinated Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, affirmative covenants and negative covenants and prepayment terms.
Mr. Alan G. Quasha, a member of our Board of Directors, has business relationships with McLarty Capital through indirect interests that he has through the Everest Hill Group (see, "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management").  The Everest Hill Group has an indirect investment interest in McLarty Capital through a limited partner of McLarty Capital.  McLarty Capital has also invested in various entities in which Everest Hill Group also has indirect interests.  As a result of the Everest Hill Group business relationships with McLarty Capital, the Board of Directors determined prior to the inception date of the McLarty Capital Subordinated Loan Agreement that Mr. Quasha had interests in, or in connection with, the Subordinated Loan Agreement that could be different from the interests of the Company's shareholders generally.  The Board of Directors therefore created a special committee of directors (the "Special Committee"), none of whom is an officer or executive of the Company and none of whom has any interest in, or in connection with McLarty or the Subordinated Loan Agreement, that may be different from the interests of the Company's shareholders generally, to independently review, consider, evaluate, and possibly take action with respect to the Subordinated Loan Agreement.  The Special Committee consisted of the Company's independent directors Messrs. Eddie W. Neely, Gregory D. Wallis and Todd A. Grimm.  The Special Committee was given extensive authority to evaluate and negotiate the Subordinated Loan Agreement, and to make recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding such transaction.  The Special Committee was also granted authority to engage its own legal counsel and its own financial advisors to negotiate the Subordinated Loan Agreement independently of management.  The Board of Directors also determined that it would not enter into the transaction without the authorization of the Special Committee.  For purposes of ascertaining the fairness and reasonableness of the transaction with McLarty Capital, the Special Committee reviewed comparative public company information regarding similarly-situated subordinated loan transactions over the 18 months prior to the transaction and summaries of the material terms and conditions applicable to comparable transactions.  Following their independent review, the Special Committee determined that it would be in the best interest  Table of Contents of the Company and its shareholders for the Company to enter into the Subordinated Loan Agreement and related loan documents.
Except as set forth herein, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2017, and subsequent to such date through the date hereof, there were no transactions between the Company and its directors, executive officers or known holders of greater than five percent of the Company's Common Stock in which the amount involved exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or one percent (1%) of the average of our Company's total assets at the applicable year end period, in which any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, and there is no such currently proposed transaction.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2: RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF MOSS ADAMS LLP 
TO SERVE AS OUR CERTIFIED INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
On December 15, 2015, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors dismissed its former certified public accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant") and engaged Hein & Associates LLP ("Hein") as the Company's independent registered public accountant.  Hein previously served as the Company's independent registered public accountant until April 10, 2014.  In deciding to select Hein, the Audit Committee reviewed auditor independence issues and existing commercial relationships with Hein and concluded that Hein has no commercial relationship with the Company that would impair its independence.  Effective November 16, 2017, Moss Adams LLP ("Moss Adams") acquired Hein, and Moss Adams served as the independent public accounting firm that audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, as filed with the SEC on September 28, 2018 as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
The Board of Directors and its Audit Committee recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of ratifying the selection of the certified public accounting firm of Moss Adams as the auditors who will continue to audit financial statements and perform other approved services for the year ending June 30, 2019, or until the Audit Committee and Board of Directors, in its discretion, replaces them. 
An affirmative vote of the majority of shares represented at the meeting is necessary to ratify the selection of auditors.  There is no legal requirement for submitting this proposal to the shareholders; however, the Board of Directors believes it is of sufficient importance to seek ratification.  Whether the proposal is ratified or defeated, the Board of Directors may reconsider, at its discretion, its selection of Moss Adams.  Representatives of Moss Adams are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting.
The Audit Committee reviews and determines whether specific projects or expenditures with our independent registered public accounting firm (auditor), potentially affects their independence.  The Audit Committee's policy requires that all services the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (auditor) may provide to the Company, including audit services and permitted audit-related services, be pre-approved in advance by the Audit Committee.  In the event that an audit or non-audit service requires approval prior to the next scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee, the auditor must contact the Chairman of the Audit Committee to obtain such approval.  Any approval will be reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
Audit Fees of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to us by Moss Adams LLP (and its predecessor, Hein) for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.
