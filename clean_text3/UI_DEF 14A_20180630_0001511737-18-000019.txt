Dear Stockholders:
We are pleased to invite you to attend our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held virtually on December 11, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (the "Annual Meeting").
The virtual Annual Meeting can be accessed by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/UBNT2018, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live, submit questions and vote online. We believe that a virtual stockholder meeting provides greater access to those who may want to attend and therefore have chosen this over an in-person meeting.
The matters to be considered at the meeting are described in detail in the attached proxy statement. You will have an opportunity to submit questions or comments on matters of interest to stockholders generally. Included with the proxy statement is a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Please use this opportunity to take part in the affairs of Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. by voting on the business to come before this meeting. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote your proxy as soon as possible. Returning the proxy card does not deprive you of your right to attend the meeting and to vote your shares in person, and may save us from incurring additional proxy solicitation costs.
Thank you for your ongoing support of Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. We look forward to your attendance at the virtual Annual Meeting.

PROXY STATEMENT
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND THE ANNUAL MEETING
[BEGIN TABLE]

The virtual Annual Meeting can be accessed by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/UBNT2018, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live, submit questions and vote online. We believe that a virtual stockholder meeting provides greater access to those who may want to attend and therefore have chosen this over an in-person meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What items of business will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The items of business scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are: 
[END TABLE]
• The election of two Class I directors to serve until the third annual meeting of our stockholders following their election or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified;
• To ratify the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"); and
• To conduct a non-binding advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation; and
• To conduct a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of holding an advisory stockholder vote on executive office compensation.
We will also consider any other business that properly comes before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

• For "TWO YEARS" as the frequency of future stockholder votes on executive compensation, on an advisory and non-binding basis (Proposal No.4)
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What information is contained in these proxy materials? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You are receiving a proxy card, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Annual Report") for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") and this proxy statement (collectively, the "proxy materials"). The information in this proxy statement relates to the  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, the voting process, the compensation of our directors and most highly paid executive officers, corporate governance and information on our Board and certain other required information.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What shares can I vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 (the "Record Date") is entitled to be voted on all items being voted on at the Annual Meeting. You may vote all shares owned by you as of the Record Date, including (1) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record, and (2) shares held for you as the beneficial owner in street name through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee. On the Record Date there were 72,410,601 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many votes am I entitled to per share? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: For all matters described in this proxy statement for which your vote is being solicited, each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held as of the Record Date. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Most of our stockholders hold their shares as a beneficial owner through a broker or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
[END TABLE]
Stockholder of Record
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and we sent the proxy materials directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You may also vote on the internet or by telephone, as described in the proxy materials and below under the heading "How can I vote my shares without attending the virtual Annual Meeting?"
Beneficial Owner
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, trust, or other similar organization, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and the proxy materials were or will be forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee how to vote your shares, and you are also invited to attend the virtual Annual Meeting.
Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting. If you do not wish to vote in person or you will not be attending the Annual Meeting, you may direct your broker, bank trustee, or other nominee how to vote your shares. You may vote in accordance with the instructions provided by your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee, as described in the proxy materials and below under the heading "How can I vote my shares without attending the virtual Annual Meeting?"
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How can I vote my shares in person at the virtual Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted by you in person at the virtual Annual Meeting. Shares held beneficially in street name may be voted by you in person at the virtual Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the  
[END TABLE]
broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the virtual Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may:
• vote via the virtual meeting website—any stockholder can attend the virtual Annual Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/UBNT2018, where stockholders may vote and submit questions during the meeting. The meeting starts at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). Please have your 16-Digit Control Number to join the Annual Meeting. Instructions on how to attend and participate via the Internet, including how to demonstrate proof of stock ownership, are posted at www.proxyvote.com;
• vote via telephone or Internet—in order to do so, please follow the instructions shown on your proxy card; or
• vote by mail—complete, sign and date the proxy card enclosed herewith and return it before the Annual Meeting in the envelope provided. Table of Contents
Votes submitted by telephone or Internet must be received by 11:59 pm Eastern Time on December 10, 2018. Submitting your proxy, whether via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail, will not affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the virtual Annual Meeting.  If you are not the stockholder of record, please refer to the voting instructions provided by your nominee to direct your nominee on how to vote your shares.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How can I vote my shares without attending the virtual Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the virtual Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy. You can vote by proxy over the internet by following the instructions provided in the proxy materials, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can also vote by mail or telephone pursuant to instructions provided on the proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may direct your nominee how to vote your shares over the internet by following the instructions provided in the proxy materials, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can also direct your nominee how to vote your shares by telephone or mail by following the voting instruction card provided to you by your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You may change your vote at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. If you are the stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy by (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the methods described above (and until the applicable deadline for each method), (2) providing a written notice of revocation to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 prior to your shares being voted, or (3) attending the virtual Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the virtual meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request. For shares you hold beneficially in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee following the instructions they provided, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the virtual Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Is my vote confidential? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either among our employees or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card, which are then forwarded to our management. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How can I attend the virtual Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Any stockholder can attend the virtual Annual Meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/UBNT2018, where stockholders may vote and submit questions during the meeting. Please have your 16-Digit Control Number to join the Annual Meeting. The virtual meeting will begin promptly at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on December 11, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to hold the meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, even if you wish to abstain from voting on some or all matters introduced at the meeting, if you are present and vote in person at the meeting or have properly submitted a proxy card. Both abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How are votes counted? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In the election of directors (Proposal 1), you may vote "FOR" some or all of the nominees or your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to some or all of the nominees. 
[END TABLE]
For the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 (Proposal 2), and the non-binding advisory vote on NEO compensation (Proposal 3), you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN." If you elect to "ABSTAIN," the abstention has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." If you  Table of Contents provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If no instructions are indicated, the shares will be voted as recommended by our Board
For the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder votes on executive compensation (Proposal 4), you may vote "ONE YEAR," "TWO YEARS", "THREE YEARS" or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card or over the telephone or internet, the shares will be voted as recommended by our board of directors. (See "How does our Board recommend that I vote?" above for additional information.)
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A plurality of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote is required for the election of directors, which means that the two nominees received the highest number of affirmative vote will be elected. The affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required to approve the ratification of appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 (Proposal 2), and the non-binding advisory vote on NEO compensation (Proposal 3). The option, "1 YEAR", "2 YEARS" or "3 YEARS," that receives the most votes for the non-binding, advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder votes on executive compensation (Proposal 4) will be considered the option selected by stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" such proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained. Abstentions are considered votes cast and thus have the same effect as votes against the matter. 
We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank or brokerage firm by voting your proxy. This action ensures your shares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your wishes.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: No. You may not cumulate your votes for the election of directors. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Other than the four items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the person named as proxy holder, Hartley Nisenbaum or Kevin Radigan, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If for any reason any nominee is not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by our Board. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who will serve as inspector of elections? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The inspector of elections will be Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will assist the inspector of elections with tabulating the votes. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: We will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. If you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the internet, you are responsible for internet access charges you may incur. If you choose to vote by telephone, you are responsible for telephone charges you may incur. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. The estimated cost of the proxy materials is $13,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish them on our website at http://ir.ubnt.com/index.cfm. We will also disclose voting results on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") within four business days after the Annual Meeting, which will also be available on our website.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I obtain a separate set of proxy materials or request a single set for my household? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of the notice and our annual report and proxy statement unless one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees. Each stockholder who participates in householding will continue to be able to access or receive a separate proxy card.

  Director Independence 
In October 2018, our Board undertook a review of the independence of our directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise the director's ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out the director's responsibilities, among the other criteria for "independent directors" as defined under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"). In evaluating the directors' independence, the Board considered the nature of any executive officer's personal investment interest in the director affiliated entities (active or passive), the level of involvement by the director or executive officer as a partner in the director affiliated entities, any special arrangements between the parties which would lead to a personal benefit, any personal benefits derived as a result of business relationships with the Company, any other personal benefit derived by any director or executive officer as a result of the disclosed relationships or any other relevant factors. As a result of this review, our Board determined that each of Messrs. Michael E. Hurlston, Ronald A. Sege and Rafael Torres, who are currently serving on our Board, are "independent directors" as defined under the rules of NASDAQ and constitute a majority of directors of our Board as required by the rules of NASDAQ. Additionally, our Board previously determined that Messrs. Michael E. Hurlston, Ronald A. Sege and Rafael Torres, who served on our Board during the last fiscal year, were "independent directors" as defined under the rules of NASDAQ, constituting a majority of independent directors of our Board during the last fiscal year as required by the rules of NASDAQ.
 Board Composition
Our Board is currently composed of four members. Our bylaws permit our Board to establish by resolution the authorized number of directors and four directors are currently authorized.
Our directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal in size as is practicable, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term of office for each Class is three years. At each annual meeting of stockholders, each of the successors elected to replace the directors of a Class whose term shall have expired at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the third annual meeting next succeeding his or her election and until his or her respective successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. Currently, the terms of the directors expire upon the election and qualification of successor directors at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held during 2018 for the Class I directors, 2019 for the Class II director and 2020 for the Class III director.

Board Leadership Structure
Robert J. Pera is the Chairman of our Board and our largest stockholder. Mr. Pera has also served as our Chief Executive Officer since our company was founded. The Board believes that Mr. Pera brings a strategic perspective to the position of Chairman, and that it remains in the best interests of shareholders for him to continue to serve in that role.
Ronald A. Sege is the lead independent director of the Board. In light of the size of our Board and the oversight provided by, and involvement of, our independent directors and Board committees in the leadership of our company, our Board considers that our current leadership structure and conduct combines appropriate leadership with the ability to conduct our business efficiently and with appropriate care and attention.
Our Board has as an objective that its membership be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. The nominating and governance committee selects candidates for director based on their independence, character, judgment, diversity of experience, business acumen and ability to act on behalf of all stockholders. In seeking qualified candidates, diversity of background, including diversity of gender, race, or ethnic or national origin is also a relevant factor in the selection process in order to promote a well-balanced board with varying perspectives. The nominating and governance committee believes that nominees for director should have experience that may be useful to us and our Board, such as experience in operational management, accounting and finance, legal and compliance, or industry and technology knowledge, as well as high personal and professional ethics and the willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties as a director. The nominating and governance committee believes it appropriate for at least one, and preferably multiple, members of our Board to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules, and for a majority of the members of our Board to meet the definition of "independent director" under the rules of NASDAQ. The nominating and governance committee also believes it appropriate for certain key members of our management to participate as members of our Board.
Our Board is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect us as further described in "Board's Role in Risk Oversight" below. This oversight is conducted primarily through the committees of our Board, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees described in "Committees of the Board of Directors" below and in the charters of each of the committees, but our Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks.

We believe that the respective charters and functioning of each of the nominating and governance committee, the audit committee and the compensation committee comply with the applicable requirements of NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations. We intend to comply with future requirements to the extent they become applicable to us.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Our Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management.

In its oversight role, our Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Board holds strategic planning sessions with senior management to discuss strategies, key challenges, risks and opportunities for us.

Additionally, our Board regularly receives updates from senior management and outside advisors regarding certain risks we face, including various operating risks. Our senior management attends meetings of our Board and its committees on a quarterly basis, and as is otherwise needed, and are available to address any questions or concerns raised by our Board on risk management and any other matters.

PROPOSAL TWO
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The audit committee of our Board has appointed KPMG as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019. Since the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, KPMG has served as our independent registered public accounting firm. Even if this appointment is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may appoint another independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the audit committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. If the appointment is not ratified by our stockholders, the audit committee may reconsider whether it should appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Representatives of KPMG are expected to attend the virtual Annual Meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. As previously disclosed, the Company dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective as of December 5, 2016, and on December 7, 2016, engaged KPMG to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company.
Changes in Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 
As previously disclosed, on December 5, 2016, the audit committee of our Board decided that, effective immediately, it would dismiss PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. On December 7, 2016, the audit committee engaged KPMG as its independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. 
The report of PwC on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and such report was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and the subsequent interim period through December 5, 2016, the Company has not had any disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in their report on the Company's financial statements for such years.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and the subsequent interim period through December 5, 2016, there were no reportable events, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except as set forth below.
As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, management concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, due to the material weaknesses described below.
Management determined that the Company did not maintain an effective control environment, attributable to a lack of sufficient, competent personnel necessary for effective financial reporting. This resulted in the lack of comprehensive and up-to-date accounting policies and procedures, skepticism on the part of key accounting personnel, internal control training, leadership and adequate communication of roles and responsibilities. Growth in the complexity of the business without commensurate growth in the capabilities of the finance and accounting organization contributed to this deficiency.
The Company's failure to maintain an effective control environment contributed to a second deficiency in the form of ineffectively designed and maintained controls required for safeguarding of the Company's funds and timely detection of improper transactions in the general ledger. Specifically, the Company's disbursement authorization policies were not updated timely for changes in personnel and positions, nor were authorization requirements clearly stated, including those for non-routine transactions.
The Company's failure to maintain an effective control environment also contributed to a third deficiency in the form of ineffectively designed and maintained controls over user access and transaction privileges to modify and post entries to the general ledger and subsidiary ledgers. In particular, the scope of user access and transaction privileges to the general ledger and subsidiary ledgers is not sufficiently restricted to provide reasonable assurance of effective process and review controls over postings to the general ledger. Additionally, general ledger changes were completed without due consideration of collateral impacts on segregation of duties controls.
The subject matter of these material weaknesses was discussed by the audit committee with PwC. The audit committee had authorized PwC to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm concerning these material weaknesses.
As disclosed in the Company's Form 8-K dated December 8, 2016, the Company provided PwC a copy of the above disclosures in the Form 8-K and requested that PwC provide the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PwC agreed with the statements above made by the Company in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K.  A copy of PwC's letter dated December 7, 2016 furnished by PwC in response to that request was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Form 8-K. Table of Contents
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and through the effective date of KPMG's engagement, the Company did not consult with KPMG regarding (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed or (b) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, in either case where a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice provided that KPMG concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues. Additionally, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and through the effective date of their engagement, the Company did not consult with KPMG regarding any other matter that was either the subject of a disagreement between the Company and its former auditor or was a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, respectively).
Required Vote
Ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 requires the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted "FOR" ratification of the appointment of KPMG.
Recommendation
Our Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

PROPOSAL THREE
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the SEC's rules in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on us, the compensation committee or our Board. The say-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the compensation committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond. Our Board and our compensation committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will communicate directly with stockholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote, consider our stockholders' concerns and the compensation committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2018 executive compensation program. See the "Executive Compensation" section below for more information.
The compensation committee oversees the development and administration of our executive compensation program. In order to create long-term value for our stockholders, the executive compensation program is intended to reflect the following principles:
• Total compensation opportunities should be competitive with market leaders. We believe that our total compensation programs should be competitive with market leaders so that we, as a lesser known company, can attract, retain and motivate talented executive officers who will help us to perform better than our competitors. We expect our executive officers to run a high-performance, efficient organization that rewards individual contributors for their ownership of various aspects of our business. We compensate our executive officers using the same philosophy.
• Total compensation should be related to our performance. We believe that a significant portion of our executive officers' total compensation should be linked to achieving specified financial and business objectives that we believe will create stockholder value and provide incentives to our officers to work as a team.
• Equity awards align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. We believe that in certain circumstances, an executive officer's total compensation should have an equity component because stock-based equity awards help reinforce the executive officer's long term interest in our overall performance and thereby align the interests of the executive officer with those of our stockholders. We do not generally provide refresher grants to our executive officers due to the ownership of common stock or options that the executive receives when commencing employment. To recognize the changes in our capital structure and management, we anticipate that the compensation committee will assess vested and unvested equity holdings regularly.
We believe that the information we have provided above and within the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement demonstrates that our executive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to ensure management's interests are aligned with our stockholders' interests to support long-term value creation.
Required Vote
The advisory vote "FOR" approval of our executive compensation requires a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on each proposal at the annual meeting. As this is an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on the Company, our Board or the compensation committee, although our compensation committee will consider the outcome of the vote when evaluating our compensation principles, design and practices.
 Recommendation
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Ubiquiti stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in Ubiquiti's Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure." Table of Contents
PROPOSAL FOUR
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY
OF HOLDING AN ADVISORY STOCKHOLDER VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Act also enables our stockholders to indicate, at least once every six years, how frequently we should seek a non-binding advisory stockholder vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, such as Proposal Three. By voting on this Proposal Four, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer a non-binding advisory stockholder vote on named executive officer compensation once every one, two, or three years. Stockholders may also abstain from voting.
After careful consideration, our Board has determined that a non-binding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation that occurs once every two years is the most appropriate alternative for us, and therefore our Board recommends that you vote for a non-binding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation once every two years.
In formulating its recommendation, our Board considered that given the nature of our compensation programs, a vote every two years would be sufficient for our stockholders to provide us with their input on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices. Such frequency provides regular input by stockholders, while allowing time to evaluate the effects of our compensation program on performance over a longer period.
We understand that our stockholders may have different views as to what is the best approach for us, and we look forward to hearing from our stockholders on this proposal.
Required Vote
The option of one year, two years or three years that receives the highest number of votes cast by stockholders will be the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation that has been selected by stockholders. However, because this vote is advisory and not binding on us, the compensation committee or our Board, our Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and us to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our stockholders.
Recommendation
Our Board recommends a vote for "TWO YEARS" as the frequency with which stockholders are provided a non-binding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation. Table of Contents
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The following report of the audit committee does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by Ubiquiti under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The audit committee assists our Board in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee management's implementation of our financial reporting process. It is not the duty of the audit committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls and disclosure controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In discharging its oversight role, the audit committee reviewed and discussed with our management and independent registered public accounting firm the audited financial statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report as well as management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting.
The audit committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by AS No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), as amended by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 90. Audit Committee Communications. In addition, the audit committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from us and our management, including the matters in the written disclosures required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and considered whether the provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the registered public accounting firm's independence.
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the audit committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report for filing with the SEC.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for fiscal 2018 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations, and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.
Overview
The compensation committee of our Board is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring our executive compensation program. Our Board or the compensation committee, as the case may be, seeks to ensure that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is fair and reasonable. Currently, we have two executive officers-our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, whom we refer to as the named executive officers. Details of our fiscal 2018 compensation can be found in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. We provide types of compensation and benefits (e.g., health care, life insurance, 401(k) plan) to our named executive officers similar to those we provide to our senior managers.
This section describes our compensation program for our named executive officers. The discussion focuses on our executive compensation policies and decisions and the most important factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. We address why we believe our compensation program is appropriate for us and our stockholders and explain how executive compensation is determined.
Compensation philosophy and objectives
Historically, our compensation packages focused on the cash component of compensation with competitive salaries and a significant percentage of total cash compensation tied to a discretionary cash bonus given at the end of the year based on our performance. Some of our executive officers received equity awards or purchased founders' stock upon joining us, and the level of their ownership of our Company may be revisited from time to time to ensure it aligns with our executive compensation philosophy. As our organizational priorities continue to evolve, our compensation committee may re-evaluate each component of our executive compensation program on a quantitative and qualitative basis to determine if the program is achieving our objectives.
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract talented, qualified executives to manage, grow and lead our Company and to motivate them to pursue and achieve our corporate objectives. Our existing compensation program includes short-term and long-term components, at-risk cash and equity elements, and performance payments in proportions that we believe will provide appropriate incentives to reward and retain our executives.
Our philosophy towards executive compensation reflects the following principles:
• Total compensation opportunities should be competitive with market leaders. We believe that our total compensation programs should be competitive with market leaders so that we, as a lesser known company, can attract, retain and motivate talented executive officers who will help us to perform better than our competitors. We expect our executive officers to run a high-performance, efficient organization that rewards individual contributors for their ownership of various aspects of our business. We compensate our executive officers using the same philosophy.
• Total compensation should be related to our performance. We believe that a significant portion of our executive officers' total compensation should be linked to achieving specified financial and business objectives that we believe will create stockholder value and provide incentives to our officers to work as a team.
• Equity awards align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. We believe that in certain circumstances, an executive officer's total compensation should have an equity component because stock-based equity awards help reinforce the executive officer's long term interest in our overall performance and thereby align the interests of the executive officer with those of our stockholders. We do not generally provide refresher grants to our executive officers due to the ownership of common stock or options that the executive receives when commencing employment. To recognize the changes in our capital structure and management, we anticipate that the compensation committee will assess vested and unvested equity holdings regularly.
Based on these philosophies, we seek to reward our executive officers as and when we achieve our goals and objectives and to generate stockholder returns by providing performance-based compensation.
Our executives' total compensation may vary from year to year based on our financial results and individual performance.
Weighting of compensation components. We do not use predefined ratios in determining the allocation of compensation between base salary, bonus and equity components. Rather, we set each executive's total compensation based on our experience regarding market conditions, geographic considerations, our experience regarding market norms and other factors. Our compensation policies related to executive  Table of Contents compensation apply equally to all of our executive officers. Differences in compensation levels among our executives generally reflect differing skill sets, experience, responsibilities and relative contributions.
Role of the compensation committee and executive officers in setting executive compensation.
The initial compensation arrangements with our executive officers, including the named executive officers, have been the result of arm's-length negotiations with each individual executive. Individual compensation arrangements with executives have been influenced by a number of factors, including the following:
• our need to fill a particular position;
• our financial position and growth strategy at the time of hiring;
• the individual's expertise and experience and prior compensation history; and
• the competitive nature of the position.
Fiscal 2018
Components of executive compensation. In fiscal 2018, our executive compensation program consisted of the following components: base salary; short-term incentive compensation, or STI, consisting of cash bonuses and, in some cases, long-term equity-based incentive awards. We believe that each individual component is useful in achieving one or more of the objectives of our program. Together, we believe these components have been effective in achieving our overall objectives to date.
• We use base salary to attract and retain executives; base salary levels reflect differences in job scope and responsibilities.
• We provide cash bonuses to encourage executives to deliver on short-term corporate financial and operating goals and individual objectives; a significant portion of our executives' cash compensation is linked to the achievement of short-term objectives.
• We in some cases use equity awards to encourage longer term perspective, reward innovation, provide alignment with stockholder interests, and attract and retain key talent.
Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pera, our Chief Executive Officer, holds a majority of our outstanding common stock. In July 2013, Mr. Pera determined to reduce his base salary to $0.00 per fiscal year. We did not grant Mr. Pera any equity awards in fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2018 as he was a majority stockholder of our company throughout those fiscal years. We pay 100% of the costs associated with Mr. Pera's general health and welfare benefits, as we do for all of our U.S.-based employees.
VP of Business Development. Mr. Moore served as our Vice President of Business Development from May 2008 to October 2018 and our Chief Executive Officer set Mr. Moore's base salary at $130,000 in connection with the commencement of his employment. Our Board increased Mr. Moore's base salary to $150,000 in December 2009 and our compensation committee increased it to $200,000 in February 2010 as a result of its evaluation of his performance and contributions to our company and upon the recommendations of Mr. Pera. Our Board and compensation committee also approved the increase in Mr. Moore's base salary in recognition of Mr. Moore's increasing responsibilities. In February 2011, in connection with entering into an employment agreement with Mr. Moore, the compensation committee increased Mr. Moore's base salary to $212,000 in lieu of continuing to provide him with a monthly allowance for automobile related expenses. In August 2011, Mr. Moore's annual base salary was increased to $250,000 and was subsequently increased to $300,000 in July 2013. In July 2017, Mr. Moore's annual base salary was increased to $330,000. Prior to entering into the employment agreement with us in February 2011, we had no agreement with Mr. Moore to pay cash bonuses to him but have done so in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2010 and we anticipate we will do so in the future. In connection with his hiring in fiscal 2008, we granted Mr. Moore options to purchase 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at $0.05 per share. On March 16, 2012 we granted Mr. Moore 5,000 RSUs, all of which vested on December 31, 2012. On July 31, 2015, we granted Mr. Moore 3,030 RSUs. These RSUs vest or vested as follows: 758 RSUs vested on July 7, 2016; 758 RSUs vested on July 7, 2017; 757 RSUs vested on July 7, 2018; and the remaining 757 RSUs vest on July 7, 2019.  On July 29, 2016, we granted Mr. Moore 2,538 RSUs. These RSUs vest or vested as follows: 635 RSUs vested on July 8, 2017; 635 RSUs vested on July 8, 2018; 634 RSUs vest on July 8, 2019; and the remaining 634 RSUs vest on July 8, 2020. See "Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2018" and "Outstanding Equity Awards at June 30, 2018" for more information regarding the option and RSU grants to Mr. Moore. We also pay 100% of the costs associated with Mr. Moore's general health and welfare benefits, as we do for all of our U.S.-based employees.  As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on October 12, 2018, Mr. Moore has resigned as the Vice President of Business Development on October 10, 2018. All unvested RSUs granted to Mr. Moore as of October 10, 2018 have been forfeited.
Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Radigan has served as our Chief Accounting Officer since May 2016 and our Chief Executive Officer set Mr. Radigan's base salary at $350,000, with an annual target bonus equal to $100,000, based on the discretion of our Board. In July 2017, Mr. Radigan's annual base salary was increased to $367,500. On August 16, 2018, we granted Mr. Radigan 2,361 RSUs. These RSUs vest as  Table of Contents follows: 591 RSUs vest on July 1, 2019; 590 RSUs vest on July 1, 2020; 590 RSUs vest on July 1, 2021; and the remaining 590 RSUs vest on July 1, 2022.  We also pay 100% of the costs associated with Mr. Radigan's general health and welfare benefits, as we do for all of our U.S.-based employees.
Benefits. Our executives participate in our standard benefit plans, which are offered to all U.S.-based employees and include our 401(k) plan. We maintain a 401(k) retirement plan which is intended to be a tax qualified defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, all of our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan following the start date of their employment, at the beginning of each calendar month. The 401(k) plan provides a salary deferral program pursuant to which participants may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed limit, equal to $18,500 in 2018, and contribute the withheld amount to the 401(k) plan. We may, in our sole discretion, make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions to the 401(k) plan on behalf of our employees who are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. It has been our practice to match up to 1% of an employee's annual salary, provided the employee contributes at least 4% of his or her salary. We offer this benefit to our named executive officers.
Our executives have the opportunity to participate in our health and welfare benefit programs which include a group medical program, a group dental program, a vision program, life insurance, and disability insurance. These benefits are the same as those offered to all of our U.S.-based employees. Through our benefit programs, each of our named executive officers receives group term life insurance in an amount equal to the lessor of twice their annual salary or $500,000.
Stock ownership guidelines. We do not currently have stock ownership guidelines.
Consideration of Say-on-Pay Vote Results. The Company provides its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a advisory vote on executive compensation once every two years (a "say-on-pay proposal"). The compensation committee will continue to consider the results of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.
Compensation Approaches
Compensation Committee. The compensation committee of our Board has overall responsibility for recommending to our Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the committee are appointed by our Board. Currently, the committee consists of three members of our Board, Messrs. Hurlston, Sege and Torres. Our Board determined that each member of our compensation committee was and remains an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, a "nonemployee" director for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act and an "independent director" as that term is defined under the rules of NASDAQ.
The fundamental responsibilities of our compensation committee are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to provide oversight of our compensation policies, plans and benefit programs including reviewing and making recommendations to our Board regarding compensation plans, as well as general compensation goals and guidelines for our executive officers and our Board; 
• to review and determine all compensation arrangements for our executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer) and to allocate total compensation among the various components of executive pay; 
• to review and approve all equity compensation awards to our executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer); and 
• to oversee and direct our equity compensation plans, as applicable to our employees, including executive officers.

The compensation committee has the authority to engage the services of outside consultants pursuant to the committee's charter. The compensation committee engaged Compensia, Inc. to serve as the compensation committee's independent compensation consultant for fiscal 2018.
In determining each executive officer's compensation, our compensation committee will review our corporate financial performance and financial condition and assess the performance of the individual executive officer. The evaluation of individual performance is conducted by the compensation committee in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, and by the Chief Executive Officer in the case of other executives. The Chief Executive Officer meets with the compensation committee to discuss executive compensation matters and to make recommendations to the compensation committee with respect to other executives. The compensation committee may modify individual compensation components for executives other than the Chief Executive Officer after reviewing the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations. The compensation committee is not bound to, and may not always accept, the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations. The compensation committee also reviews the Chief Executive Officer's performance and confer with the full board of directors (excluding the Chief Executive Officer). The compensation committee then makes all final compensation decisions for executive officers and approves any equity incentive awards for all of our executive officers. In addition, it is the committee's practice to consult with the independent members of our Board prior to making material changes to our compensation policies. Table of Contents
Although we may make many compensation decisions in the first quarter of the fiscal year, the compensation evaluation process is ongoing. Compensation discussions and decisions are designed to promote our fundamental business objectives and strategy. Evaluation of management performance and rewards are performed annually or more often as needed. The compensation committee has the discretion to adjust a component of compensation during the year in the event that it determines that circumstances warrant.
Generally, we have granted options and RSUs following an executive officer's start date. However, this practice may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each hire. The initial grants to each executive officer were principally based on the prevailing range of initial grants to our other executives with consideration given to the nature of the job and the individual's experience, as well as the current market conditions relating to equity ownership of officers in similar positions at similarly situated companies. Our compensation committee does not have any specific policy regarding the timing of equity awards and such awards have not historically been made regularly or automatically to our executive officers on an annual basis.
Severance Compensation and Termination Protection
See the sections entitled "-Employment Agreements" or "-Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control" for a description of agreements with, and the tables setting forth, the potential severance or change of control payments to be made to each named executive officer and definitions of key terms under these agreements. Our compensation committee believes that these change in control vesting and severance benefits could serve to minimize the distraction caused by a potential transaction involving a change in control and reduce the risk that an executive would leave his employment before a transaction is consummated.
Accounting and Tax Considerations
In August 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance with respect to the changes made by the Tax Cuts and Job Act ("TCJA") to the rules under code Section 162(m), which limits the federal tax deduction of compensation paid in any fiscal year to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and the three other most highly compensated officers. The TCJA expands the number of individuals covered by code Section 162(m) and eliminates the Section 162(m) "performance-based compensation" exception for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except for otherwise qualified compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not subsequently materially modified in any material respect on or after such date. 
While the compensation committee cannot predict how the deductibility limit may impact our compensation program in future years, the compensation committee intends to maintain an approach to executive compensation that strongly links pay to performance. In addition, while the compensation committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, the compensation committee intends to consider tax deductibility under Section 162(m) as a factor in compensation decisions.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and applicable SEC rules, we have prepared the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, to the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company.
For fiscal year 2018, the total compensation for the median employee of the Company was $57,000.  Our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pera does not receive compensation from the Company and, as such, the ratio is 0 to 1.  
The median employee was identified by reviewing the consistently applied compensation measure of annual cash base salary, per payroll records, for all Ubiquiti employees, including its consolidated subsidiaries, as of June 30 2018, which is the last pay period for the 2018 fiscal year. Any salaries denominated in foreign currencies were translated to U.S. dollars at the corresponding exchange rate as of June 30, 2018. We used the annual cash base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure as it represents the primary compensation component paid to all of our employees each fiscal year and is the one pay component that has a similar definition and is reported in a similar manner globally. All of the Company's full time and part time employees were included in the calculation and adjustments were made to annualize base salary for any employees not employed by Ubiquiti for the entire fiscal year or any unpaid leave during the fiscal year. Mr. Pera was excluded from the calculation of median employee for the purposes of this determination. Table of Contents
After identifying the median employee based on the criteria described above, the total compensation for this employee was calculated using the same methodology that was used in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Total compensation during 2018 for this employee includes base salary and annual cash bonus for fiscal year 2018.
This pay ratio is an estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. SEC rules do not specify a single methodology for identification of the median employee or calculation of the pay ratio, and other companies may use assumptions and methodologies that are different from those used by us in calculating their pay ratio. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio as reported above.
Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2018
There were no grants of plan-based awards to any of our named executive officers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On November 13, 2013, the Company entered into an aircraft lease agreement (the "Aircraft Lease Agreement") with RJP Manageco LLC (the "Lessor"), a limited liability company owned by the Company's CEO, Robert J. Pera. Pursuant to the Aircraft Lease Agreement, the Company may lease an aircraft owned by the Lessor for Company business purposes. Under the Aircraft Lease Agreement, the aircraft may be leased at a rate of $5,000 per flight hour. This hourly rate does not include the cost of flight crew or on-board services, which the Company will purchase from a third-party provider. The Company recognized a total of approximately $1,600,000 in expenses pursuant to the Aircraft Lease Agreement during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. All expenses pursuant to the Aircraft Lease Agreement have been included in the Company's sales, general and administrative expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other than Aircraft Lease Agreement discussed above, we did not have any transactions since the beginning of fiscal 2018 to which we were a party in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers, which are described where required under the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement.
Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions
As provided by the audit committee charter, the audit committee of our Board must review and approve any related party transaction. Furthermore, approval should be obtained prior to entering into the transaction when the audit committee is aware of such transaction. All of our directors, officers and employees are required to report to the audit committee any related party transaction prior to entering into the transaction.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and any persons holding more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to report initial ownership of such equity shares and any subsequent changes in ownership to the SEC. Such officers, directors and 10% stockholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Specific due dates have been established by the SEC, and we are required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to file required ownership reports by these dates. Based solely on our review of copies of such forms received, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no additional filings were required for such persons, we believe that, during fiscal 2018, our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements. 
 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
The following table sets forth certain information as of October 16, 2018, as to shares of our common stock beneficially owned by: (1) each person who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common stock, (2) each of our current named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, (3) each of our directors and nominees and (4) all our current directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise stated below, the address of each beneficial owner listed on the table is c/o Ubiquiti Networks, Inc., 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.
The percentage of common stock beneficially owned is based on 72,410,601 shares outstanding as of October 16, 2018. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to options held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after October 16, 2018 and RSUs that will vest within 60 days after October 16, 2018. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.  Table of Contents

(1) As previously disclosed, Mr. Pera has entered into arrangements under which he has pledged up to 25% of the shares of common stock that he beneficially owns to secure loans with financial institutions. Mr. Pera had also indicated these loans have or will have various requirements to repay all or portion of the loan upon the occurrence of various events, including when the price of common stock goes below certain specified levels. Mr. Pera may need to sell shares of our common stock to meet these repayment requirements. Upon a default under one or more of these loans, the lender could sell the pledged shares into the market without limitation on volume or manner of sale. Sales of shares by Mr. Pera to reduce his loan balance or the lenders upon foreclosure are likely to adversely affect our stock price.
