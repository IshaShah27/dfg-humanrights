APARTMENT INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMPANY 
4582 SOUTH ULSTER STREET, SUITE 1100 
DENVER, COLORADO 80237 
PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD ON APRIL 30, 2019 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco" or the "Company") has made these proxy materials available to you on the Internet, or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail. We are furnishing this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation by our Board of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting (the "Meeting"), and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. The Meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. at Aimco's corporate headquarters, 4582 South Ulster Street, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80237. 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to each stockholder entitled to vote at the Meeting. The mailing of such Notice is scheduled to begin on or about March 15, 2019. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and request a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, the Notice includes instructions on how stockholders may request proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. 
This solicitation is made by mail on behalf of Aimco's Board. Costs of the solicitation will be borne by Aimco. Further solicitation of proxies may be made by telephone, fax or personal interview by the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates, who will not receive additional compensation for the solicitation. The Company has retained the services of Alliance Advisors LLC, for an estimated fee of $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses, to assist in the solicitation of proxies from brokerage houses, banks, and other custodians or nominees holding stock in their names for others. The Company will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy material to stockholders. 
Holders of record of the Class A Common Stock of the Company ("Common Stock") as of the close of business on the record date, February 22, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote. At the close of business on the Record Date, there were 144,265,791 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 
Whether you are a "stockholder of record" or hold your shares through a broker or nominee (i.e., in "street name") you may direct your vote without attending the Meeting in person. 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote via the Internet by following the instructions in the Notice. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may also vote by signing your proxy card and returning it by mail or by submitting your vote by telephone. You should sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as guardian, executor, trustee, custodian, attorney or officer of a corporation), you should indicate your name and title or capacity. 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may be eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions in the Notice. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may also vote by signing the voter instruction card provided by your bank or broker and returning it by mail. If you provide specific voting instructions by mail, telephone or the Internet, your shares will be voted by your broker or nominee as you have directed. 
The persons named as proxies are officers of Aimco. All proxies properly submitted in time to be counted at the Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If you submit your proxy without voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Proxies may be revoked at any time before voting by filing a notice of revocation with the Corporate Secretary of the Company, by filing a later dated proxy with the Corporate Secretary of the Company or by voting in person at the Meeting. 
You are entitled to attend the Meeting only if you were an Aimco stockholder or joint holder as of the Record Date or if you hold a valid proxy for the Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record but hold shares in street name, you should provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as your most recent account statement prior to February 22, 2019, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker, trustee or nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership. 
Brokers holding shares of record for customers generally are not entitled to vote on certain matters unless they receive voting instructions from their customers. If you are a beneficial owner of shares and do not provide your broker, as stockholder of record, with voting instructions, your broker has authority under applicable stock market rules to vote those shares for or against "routine" matters at its discretion. At the Meeting, the following matters are not considered routine: the election of directors and the advisory vote on executive compensation. Where a matter is not considered routine, shares held by your broker will not be voted (a "broker non-vote") absent specific instructions from you, which means your shares may go unvoted on those matters and not affect the outcome if you do not specify a vote. 
The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 4582 South Ulster Street, Suite 1100, Denver, Colorado 80237.  PROPOSAL 1: 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Pursuant to Aimco's Articles of Restatement (the "Charter") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), directors are elected at each annual meeting of stockholders and hold office for one year, and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Aimco's Bylaws currently authorize a Board consisting of not fewer than three nor more than nine persons. The Board currently consists of eight directors. 
The nominees for election to the Board selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board and proposed by the Board to be voted upon at the Meeting are: 
All of the nominees were elected to the Board at the last Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Messrs. Keltner, Martin, Miller, and Stein and Mses. Nelson, Sperling, and Tran are not employed by, or affiliated with, Aimco, other than by virtue of serving as directors of Aimco. Unless authority to vote for the election of directors has been specifically withheld, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote for the election of Messrs. Considine, Keltner, Martin, Miller, and Stein and Mses. Nelson, Sperling, and Tran to hold office as directors for a term of one year until their successors are elected and qualify at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All nominees have advised the Board that they are able and willing to serve as directors. 
If any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason (which is not anticipated), the shares represented by the proxies may be voted for such other person or persons as may be determined by the holders of the proxies (unless a proxy contains instructions to the contrary). In no event will the proxy be voted for more than eight nominees. 
In an uncontested election at the meeting of stockholders, any nominee to serve as a director of the Company will be elected if the director receives a vote of the majority of votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted "for" a director exceeds the number of votes "against" that director. With respect to a contested election, a plurality of all the votes cast at the meeting of stockholders will be sufficient to elect a director. If a nominee who currently is serving as a director receives a greater number of "against" votes for his or her election than votes "for" such election (a "Majority Against Vote") in an uncontested election, Maryland law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." However, under Aimco's Bylaws, any nominee for election as a director in an uncontested election who receives a Majority Against Vote is obligated to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board for consideration. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept it. The Board is required to take action with respect to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation. 
For purposes of the election of directors, abstentions or broker non-votes as to the election of directors will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. Unless instructed to the contrary in the proxy, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted FOR the election of the eight nominees named above as directors. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE EIGHT NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL 2: 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The firm of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018, was selected by the Audit Committee to act in the same capacity for the year ending December 31, 2019, subject to ratification by Aimco's stockholders. The aggregate fees billed for services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, are described below under the heading "Principal Accountant Fees and Services." 
In selecting and overseeing the Company's independent auditor, the Audit Committee considers, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ernst & Young LLP's historical and recent performance on the Aimco audit, including the results  of an internal survey of Ernst & Young LLP's service and quality;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• External data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (PCAOB) reports on Ernst & Young LLP and its peer firms;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The appropriateness of Ernst & Young LLP's fees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ernst & Young LLP's tenure as Aimco's independent auditor and its familiarity with  Aimco's operations and business, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The depths of Ernst & Young LLP's capabilities, knowledge, expertise, experience, and resources  to support Aimco's business in the areas of accounting, auditing, internal control over financial reporting, tax and related matters; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ernst & Young LLP's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that Ernst & Young LLP is independent and that it is in the best interests of Aimco and our stockholders to retain Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent auditor for 2019. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Meeting and will respond to appropriate questions. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast regarding the proposal is required to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Abstentions or broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote on the proposal. Unless instructed to the contrary in the proxy, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted "for" the proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION 
OF THE SELECTION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP. 
PROPOSAL 3: 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Since the 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board has asked stockholders for an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. 
At Aimco's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 99% of the votes cast in the advisory vote on executive compensation that were present and entitled to vote on the matter were in favor of the compensation of Aimco's NEOs (also commonly referred to as "Say on Pay") as disclosed in Aimco's 2018 proxy statement. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") and management are pleased with these results and remain committed to extensive engagement with stockholders as part of ongoing efforts to formulate and implement an executive compensation program designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with our stockholders. Additionally, as required every six years, at Aimco's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders had the opportunity to provide an advisory vote on the frequency of future Say on Pay votes and our stockholders approved, following the recommendation of our Board, an annual Say on Pay vote.  In 2018 and early 2019, we engaged with stockholders representing over 73% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock as of September 30, 2018, as part of our annual process of soliciting feedback on Aimco's executive compensation program. The Company has continued to receive broad support from stockholders on the structure of its executive compensation program, the program's alignment of pay and performance, and the quantum of compensation delivered under the program as described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion & Analysis—Stockholder Engagement Regarding Executive Compensation." 
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion & Analysis," we seek to align closely the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our stockholders. Our compensation program is designed to reward our NEOs for the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic and operational goals and the achievement of total shareholder return ("TSR") greater than peers, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. 
Here are further details of the Aimco program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of the Committee are independent directors. The Committee has established a thorough process for  the review and approval of Aimco's executive compensation program, including amounts awarded to executive officers. The Committee engages and receives advice from an independent, third-party compensation consultant. The Committee selects a peer  group of companies to compare Aimco's compensation of executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco sets target total cash compensation and target total compensation near the median of corresponding  targets among the peer group, both as a measure of fairness and to provide an economic incentive to remain with Aimco. Consistent with Aimco's pay-for-performance  philosophy, actual compensation is based on Aimco's results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking spaces.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other than a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to which Aimco does not contribute, Aimco does not  maintain or contribute to any defined benefit pension or supplemental pension plan for its executive officers. Executive officers participate in Aimco's 401(k) plan on the same terms as available to all other Aimco team members.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco's compensation program, which, among other things, includes caps on cash compensation, shared  performance metrics across the organization, multiple performance metrics that align with Aimco's publicly communicated business strategy, the use of long-term incentive ("LTI") compensation that is based on TSR, and stock ownership  guidelines with required holding periods after vesting, are aligned with the long-term interests of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consistent with Aimco's  pay-for-performance philosophy, Mr. Considine's total compensation is highly variable from year to year, determined by Aimco's results.  Mr. Considine's base salary of $700,000 for 2018 is well below the median for CEOs of his experience, expertise and tenure. One hundred percent of Mr. Considine's 2018 target short-term incentive ("STI") compensation  was at risk, based entirely on Aimco's performance against its corporate goals, as determined by the Committee. One hundred percent of Mr. Considine's LTI, which comprises nearly two-thirds of  his target total compensation for 2018, is at risk, based on relative TSR over a forward looking, three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
Here is how the Aimco program was applied in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With solid 2018 results, executive officers were awarded STI amounts that were above target amounts.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco's 2018 performance highlights include the following:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco increased Net Asset Value ("NAV") per share by approximately 6%, which, with its cash  dividend, provided stockholders Economic Income of 8.5%. This was accomplished through:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Property Operations, where Same Store net operating income ("NOI") increased 3.1%, and Aimco  achieved record occupancy and peer leading NOI margin of 74.2%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Redevelopment, where Aimco invested $176 million in its redevelopment projects, and completed two  major projects at Park Towne Place in Center City Philadelphia, PA, and Saybrook Point in San Jose, CA. The two projects are on track to create nearly $70M of value for Aimco stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Portfolio Management, where Aimco exited the affordable business, made accretive acquisitions in  Philadelphia and northern Virginia, and repurchased 6% of its shares at a 20% discount to NAV, funding the leverage-neutral buyback with proceeds from the sale of lower-rated properties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco improved its already safe Balance Sheet by reducing 2019-2021 maturities by more than 50%,  lowering exposure to possible interest rate increases, providing annual interest savings of $13M, and increasing financial flexibility by adding nearly $1B to its pool of properties that are not encumbered by debt.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco has a stable and cohesive Team. Aimco's intentional culture was recognized once again when  the Denver Post named Aimco a "Top Place to Work" in Colorado for the sixth consecutive year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aimco had 4.1% TSR in 2018, and outperformed the NAREIT Apartment Index, the MSCI US REIT Index ("REIT  Index"), and the average TSR for its multi-family peers, in each case, over the three-year and five-year periods ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the overall compensation of our NEOs, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board or the Committee. However, as described above, we take seriously the views of our stockholders, and to the extent there is any significant vote against our executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of stockholders. 
To be approved at the Meeting, Proposal 3 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
We are asking the Company's stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the following resolution: RESOLVED, that the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure, is hereby APPROVED.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
This chart provides a summary overview of Aimco's governance practices, each of which is described in more detail in the information that follows. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Supermajority Independent Board. The only member of management who serves on the Board is the Company's founder, chairman and  chief executive officer. Seven of the eight members of the Board, or 87.5% of the Board members, are independent. 
 Independent Standing Committees. Only independent directors serve on the standing committees, including Audit, Compensation and Human  Resources, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Redevelopment and Construction Services. 
 Each Independent Director Serves on Each Standing Committee. To ensure that each independent director hears all information unfiltered  and to ensure the most efficient functioning of the Board, each independent director serves on each standing committee. 
 Lead Independent Director. The Company has a lead independent director who presides over regular independent director executive  sessions. 
 Board Refreshment. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has structured the Board such that there are directors of varying  tenures and perspectives, with new directors joining the Board every few years, including a new director in 2018, while retaining the institutional memory of longer-tenured directors. Of the original independent directors on the Aimco Board, one  remains. During early 2016 a new director joined the Board, and later in the year a director of 16 years' tenure left the Board. The Company has added a new director roughly every 2 to 6 years. 
 Regular Access to and Involvement with Management. In addition to regular access to management during Board and committee meetings, the  independent directors have ongoing, direct access to members of management and to the Aimco business. This includes Mr. Miller's involvement with site visits and analysis of redevelopment projects, Mr. Stein's active and regular  engagement with accounting staff and the Aimco auditors, Mr. Keltner's continuing involvement with compensation and personnel matters, Ms. Nelson's participation in director recruitment and other governance matters, and  Mr. Martin's frequent involvement with agenda setting, board materials, and policy matters. 
 Engaged Board. In addition to regular access to management, the independent directors meet at least quarterly and receive written  updates from Mr. Considine at least monthly. 
 Stockholder Engagement. Under the direction of the Board and including participation by Board members when requested by stockholders,  Aimco regularly engages with stockholders on governance, pay and business matters, and systematically and at least annually canvasses its largest stockholders, those holding at least two-thirds of outstanding  Aimco shares. 
 Director Stock Ownership. By the completion of five years of service, an independent director is expected to own, at a minimum, the  lesser of 27,500 shares or shares having a value of at least $550,000. The average investment by Aimco independent directors is $2.1 million. 
 Risk Assessment. The Board conducts an annual risk assessment. Areas involving risk that are reported on by management and considered  by the Board, include: operations, liquidity, leverage, finance, financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting, legal matters, regulatory compliance, compensation and human resources. 
 Majority Voting with a Resignation Policy. Since inception, Aimco's directors have been elected annually, and Aimco requires its  directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast. Directors failing to get a majority of the votes cast are expected to tender their resignation. 
 Proxy Access. Following a 2015 stockholder vote in favor of proxy access and after extensive engagement with stockholders, the Board  amended the Company's bylaws to provide proxy access. A stockholder or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our shares for three years, may submit nominees for up to 20% of the Board, or two nominees, whichever is greater,  for inclusion in our proxy materials, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our bylaws. 
 Related Party Transactions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee maintains a related party transaction policy to ensure  that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations only in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. 
 Pledging or hedging shares held to satisfy stock ownership requirements. The Company's insider trading policy places restrictions  on the Company's directors and executive officers entering into hedging transactions with respect to the Company's securities and from holding the Company's securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging such securities as  collateral for loans. Pledging or hedging transactions are permitted only in very limited circumstances, and only with respect to shares held in excess of stock ownership requirements. No directors or executive officers have in place any hedging or  pledging transactions. 
 Interlocking Directorships. No Aimco director or member of Aimco management serves on a Board or a compensation committee of a company  at which an Aimco director is also an employee. 
 Overboard Directors. Aimco's corporate governance guidelines and committee charters limit the number of other boards and the  number of other audit committees on which an Aimco director may serve. 
 Retirement Age or Term Limits. Rather than impose arbitrary limits on service, the Company regularly (and at least annually) reviews  each director's continued role on the Board and considers the need for periodic board refreshment. 
 Staggered Board. All Aimco directors have always been elected only to one-year  terms. 
[END TABLE]
 Independence of Directors 
The Board has determined that to be considered independent, an outside director may not have a direct or indirect material relationship with Aimco or its subsidiaries (directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). A material relationship is one that impairs or inhibits, or has the potential to impair or inhibit, a director's exercise of critical and disinterested judgment on behalf of Aimco and its stockholders. In determining whether a material relationship exists, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including whether the director or a family member is a current or former employee of the Company, family member relationships, compensation, business relationships and payments, and charitable contributions between Aimco and an entity with which a director is affiliated (as an executive officer, partner or substantial stockholder). In evaluating Ms. Sperling's nomination, the Board considered that the Company is presently engaged with Trammell Crow Company, or TCC, in connection with a development, in an arrangement whereby TCC is providing services on a fee basis. The Board took into account the fact that Ms. Sperling is an independent contractor with TCC and that she is not involved in the project, that her compensation is not tied to the project, and that the fee that may be earned by TCC is fixed and limited in nature, may be paid over three years, if earned, and in any one year and in the aggregate is immaterial to both Aimco and TCC. The Board consults with the Company's counsel to ensure that such determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of "independent director," including but not limited to those categorical standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange as in effect from time to time. 
Consistent with these considerations, the Board affirmatively has determined that Messrs. Keltner, Martin, Miller, and Stein and Mses. Nelson, Sperling, and Tran are independent directors (collectively the "Independent Directors"). 
Meetings and Committees 
The Board held five meetings during the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, there were four committees: Audit; Compensation and Human Resources; Nominating and Corporate Governance; and Redevelopment and Construction. During 2018, no director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate total number of meetings of the Board and each committee on which such director served. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines, as described below, provide that the Company generally expects that the Chairman of the Board will attend all annual and special meetings of the stockholders. Other members of the Board are not required to attend such meetings. All of the members of the Board attended the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the Company anticipates that all of the members of the Board will attend the Meeting this year. 
Below is a table illustrating the current standing committee memberships and chairmen. Additional detail on each committee follows the table.

 Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee currently consists of the Independent Directors. Mr. Stein serves as the chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has a written charter that is reviewed annually and was last amended in October 2017. In addition to the work of the Audit Committee, Mr. Stein has regular and recurring conversations with Mr. Beldin, Aimco's Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Ms. Cohn, Aimco's General Counsel, with the head of Aimco's internal audit function, and with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee's charter is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and is also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities are set forth in the following chart. 
The Audit Committee held five meetings during the year ended December 31, 2018. As set forth in the Audit Committee's charter, no director may serve as a member of the Audit Committee if such director serves on the audit committee of more than two other public companies, unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such director to effectively serve on the Audit Committee. No member of the Audit Committee serves on the audit committee of more than two other public companies.  Audit Committee Financial Expert 
Aimco's Board has designated Mr. Stein as an "audit committee financial expert." In addition, all of the members of the Audit Committee qualify as audit committee financial experts. Each member of the Audit Committee is independent, as that term is defined by Section 303A of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange relating to audit committees. 
Compensation and Human Resources Committee 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee currently consists of the Independent Directors. Mr. Keltner serves as the chairman of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee. Mr. Keltner meets regularly with Ms. Cohn, Aimco's General Counsel and with Jennifer Johnson, Aimco's Senior Vice President of Human Resources. Mr. Keltner also has regular conversations with the Compensation and Human Resources Committee's independent compensation consultant, Board Advisory, LLC ("Board Advisory"). The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has a written charter that is reviewed annually and was last amended in October 2018. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee's charter is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and is also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee's responsibilities are set forth in the following charts.

One of the most important responsibilities of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee is to ensure a succession plan is in place for key members of the Company's executive management team, including the CEO. Based on the work of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, the Board has a succession plan for the CEO position, is prepared to act in the event of a CEO vacancy in the short term, and has identified candidates for succession over the long term. The Board will select the successor taking into consideration the needs of the organization, the business environment, and each candidate's skills, experience, expertise, leadership and fit. The Company maintains a robust succession planning process, as highlighted in the following chart.

[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings during the year ended December 31, 2018.  Redevelopment and Construction Committee 
The Redevelopment and Construction Committee currently consists of the Independent Directors. Mr. Miller serves as the chairman of the Redevelopment and Construction Committee. Mr. Miller meets regularly with Aimco's redevelopment and construction leadership and tours projects undergoing development or redevelopment to assess the process of development and redevelopment and project status. The Redevelopment and Construction Committee's purposes are to provide oversight and guidance to the Company's management regarding development, redevelopment, and construction by reviewing work process, policies and standards, recommending modifications thereto and directing related analytical and progress reporting. The Redevelopment and Construction Committee held three meetings during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Board Composition, Board Refreshment, and Director Tenure 
Aimco is focused on having a well-constructed and high performing board. To that end, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects nominees for director based on, among other things, breadth and depth of experience, knowledge, skills, expertise, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of Aimco's business environment, and willingness to devote adequate time and effort to Board responsibilities. In considering nominees for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to have a diverse range of experience and expertise relevant to Aimco's business. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee places a premium on directors who work well in the collegial and collaborative nature of the Board (which is also consistent with the Aimco culture) and yet also requires directors who think and act independently and can clearly and effectively communicate their convictions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses the appropriate balance of criteria required of directors and makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has specifically considered the feedback of some stockholders as well as the discussions of some commentators that suggest lengthy Board tenure should be balanced with new perspectives. Specific to Aimco, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has structured the Board such that there are directors of varying tenures, with new directors and perspectives joining the Board every few years while retaining the institutional memory of longer-tenured directors. Longer-tenured directors, balanced with less-tenured directors, enhance the Board's oversight capabilities. Aimco's directors work effectively together, coordinate closely with senior management, comprehend Aimco's challenges and opportunities, and frame Aimco's business strategy. Aimco's Board members have established relationships that allow the Board to apply effectively its collective business savvy in guiding the Aimco enterprise. 
When formulating its Board membership recommendations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers advice and recommendations from others, including stockholders, as it deems appropriate. Such recommendations are evaluated based on the same criteria noted above. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider as nominees to the Board for election at next year's annual meeting of stockholders persons who are recommended by stockholders in writing, marked to the attention of Aimco's Corporate Secretary, no later than July 1, 2019. During 2018, no Aimco stockholder (other than the existing directors) expressed interest in serving on the Board or recommended anyone to serve on the Board. 
The Board is responsible for nominating members for election to the Board and for filling vacancies on the Board that may occur between annual meetings of stockholders. Based on recommendations from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board determined to nominate Messrs. Considine, Keltner, Martin, Miller, and Stein and Mses. Nelson, Sperling, and Tran for re-election. 
Board Leadership Structure 
At this time, Aimco's Board believes that combining the Chairman and CEO role is most effective for the Company's leadership and governance. Having one person as Chairman and CEO provides unified leadership and direction to the Company and strengthens the ability of the CEO to develop and implement strategic initiatives and respond efficiently in various situations. The Board also believes the combination of Chairman and CEO positions is appropriate in light of the independent oversight provided by the Board. 
Aimco has a Lead Independent Director, currently Mr. Martin, whose responsibilities are set forth in the following chart. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Lead Independent Director  Responsibilities    Accomplished In 2018   
Lead Independent Director  Responsibilities    Accomplished In 2018   
[END TABLE]
 In addition to the Lead Independent Director, the Board has a majority of independent directors. Seven out of the eight director nominees are independent. All four standing committees (Audit; Compensation and Human Resources; Nominating and Corporate Governance; and Redevelopment and Construction) are composed solely of independent directors. 
Separate Sessions of Non-Management Directors and Lead Independent Director 
Aimco's Corporate Governance Guidelines (described below) provide that the non-management directors shall meet in executive session without management on a regularly scheduled basis, but no less than four times per year. The non-management directors, which group currently is made up of the seven Independent Directors, met in executive session without management four times during the year ended December 31, 2018. Mr. Martin was the Lead Independent Director who presided at such executive sessions in 2018, and he has been designated as the Lead Independent Director who will preside at such executive sessions in 2019. 
The following table sets forth the number of meetings held by the Board and each committee during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Number of Meetings   5   4   5   5   3   3 
[END TABLE]
Majority Voting for the Election of Directors 
In an uncontested election at the meeting of stockholders, any nominee to serve as a director of the Company will be elected if the director receives a majority of votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted "for" a director exceeds the number of shares voted "against" that director. With respect to a contested election, a plurality of all the votes cast at the meeting of stockholders will be sufficient to elect a director. If a nominee who currently is serving as a director receives a greater number of "against" votes for his or her election than votes "for" such election (a "Majority Against Vote") in an uncontested election, Maryland law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." However, under Aimco's Bylaws, any nominee for election as a director in an uncontested election who receives a Majority Against Vote is obligated to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept it. The Board is required to take action with respect to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation. Additional details are set out in Article II, Section 2.03 (Election and Tenure of Directors; Resignations) of Aimco's Bylaws. 
Proxy Access 
At our 2015 annual meeting, a proxy access stockholder proposal received the support of a majority of the votes cast. That proposal requested the Board to adopt a bylaw that would require the Company to include in its proxy materials nominees for director proposed by a stockholder or group that owns at least 3% of our outstanding shares for at least three years. Following that meeting, through the summer and fall of 2015 and into 2016, we engaged in extensive stockholder outreach and discussed proxy access with stockholders representing over 66% of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2015, including all 10 of Aimco's largest stockholders as of that date. 
Although our stockholders expressed varying views on proxy access generally, and on the specific terms of a proxy access bylaw, many stockholders indicated that they viewed proxy access as an important stockholder right. At the same time, many stockholders expressed concern that stockholders with a small economic interest could abuse proxy access and impose unnecessary costs on the Company. In particular, stockholders expressed support for a reasonable limit on the number of stockholders who could come together to form a nominating group, with a consensus around a 20 stockholder limit, so long as certain related funds were counted as one stockholder for this purpose. In addition, many stockholders expressed support for the principle that a proxy access bylaw provide for a minimum of two candidates, with that principle being more meaningful to stockholders than the percentage of the board used to calculate the number of permitted proxy access candidates. 
Stockholders expressed general flexibility concerning most other proxy access terms, including counting directors nominated as access candidates who are elected and re-nominated by the Board when determining the limit on access candidates for a limited number of years, and eliminating proxy access at the same annual meeting for which a nomination notice outside of proxy access has been submitted by another stockholder. Also, stockholders indicated that post-meeting holding requirements would be considered overly restrictive, but that a statement regarding post-meeting intentions that did not require continued ownership was acceptable. 
The feedback received from stockholders was reported to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and to the Board. Following a review of that feedback, corporate governance best practices and trends and the Company's particular facts and circumstances, the Board amended the Company's bylaws to provide a proxy access right to stockholders. As a result, a stockholder or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our shares for at least three years, may submit nominees for up to 20% of the Board, or two nominees, whichever is greater, for inclusion in our proxy materials, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our bylaws.  Director Compensation 
In formulating its recommendation for director compensation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews director compensation for independent directors of companies in the real estate industry and companies of comparable market capitalization, revenue and assets and considers compensation trends for other NYSE-listed companies and S&P 500 companies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the relatively small size of the Aimco board as compared to other boards, the participation of each Independent Director on each committee, and the resulting workload on the directors. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the overall cost of the Board to the Company and the cost per director.  For 2018, compensation for each of the Independent Directors included a fixed annual cash retainer of $90,000 and an award of 3,200 shares of Common Stock (increased from 3,000 shares in 2017). No meeting fees were paid to Independent Directors for attending meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Aimco paid the directors serving on the Board during that year as follows:

Code of Ethics 
The Board has adopted a code of ethics entitled "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics" that applies to the members of the Board, all of Aimco's executive officers and all team members of Aimco or its subsidiaries, including Aimco's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on Aimco's website (www.aimco. com) and is also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. If, in the future, Aimco amends, modifies or waives a provision in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, rather than filing a Current Report on Form 8-K, Aimco intends to satisfy any applicable disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting such information on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com), as necessary. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Director Stock Ownership 
The Board has adopted and approved Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines are available on Aimco's website (www.aimco.com) and are also available in print to stockholders, upon written request to Aimco's Corporate Secretary. In general, the Corporate Governance Guidelines address director qualification standards, director responsibilities, the role of the lead independent director, director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, the role of the Board in planning management succession, stock ownership guidelines and retention requirements, and an annual performance evaluation of the Board.  With respect to stock ownership guidelines for the Independent Directors, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that by the completion of five years of service, an Independent Director is expected to own, at a minimum, the lesser of 27,500 shares or shares having a value of at least $550,000. Each of the Independent Directors has holdings well in excess of this amount, with the exception of Ms. Sperling, who joined the Board on May  1, 2018.

As with all other aspects of our business, our corporate responsibility program focuses on continuous improvement, to the benefit of our stockholders, our residents, our team members, our communities, and the environment. We actively discuss these matters with our stockholders and solicit their feedback on our program.

Denver, Colorado 80237  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS 
The Audit Committee oversees Aimco's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. A written charter approved by the Audit Committee and ratified by the Board governs the Audit Committee. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles. The Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee has received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and letter required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from the Company and its management, and has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining such firm's independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for its audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examination, its evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee held five meetings during 2018. 
None of the Audit Committee members have a relationship with the Company that might interfere with the exercise of the member's independence from the Company and its management. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements and management's report on internal control over financial reporting be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has also determined that provision by Ernst & Young LLP of other non-audit services is compatible with maintaining Ernst & Young LLP's independence. The Audit Committee and the Board have also recommended, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

In selecting Ernst & Young LLP to perform tax compliance and tax consulting services, the Audit Committee evaluated the efficiency and expertise brought by Ernst & Young LLP and concluded that such engagement was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Audit Committee considered that the Company's current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on the Company's ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership. The Audit Committee also specifically considered the amount of the fees as compared to the Company's overall engagement and as compared to Ernst & Young LLP's overall book of business and concluded that such engagement by the Company would have no negative bearing on Ernst & Young LLP's independence. 
In its pre-approval of such tax services in accordance with the policies outlined below, the Audit Committee gave appropriate consideration to the applicable independence rules of the SEC and PCAOB. Specifically, the Audit Committee considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The SEC's three basic principles of independence with respect to services provided by auditors,  violations of which would impair the auditor's independence: (1) an auditor cannot function in the role of management; (2) an auditor cannot audit his or her own work; and (3) an auditor cannot serve in an advocacy role  for his or her client;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The non-audit services specifically prohibited under the SEC's  auditor independence rules:  
• Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the audit  client;  
• Financial information systems design and implementation;  
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports;  
• Actuarial services;  
• Internal audit outsourcing services;  
• Management functions or human resources;  
• Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services; and  
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The following rules of the PCAOB:  
• 3521 - Contingent Fees;  
• 3522 - Tax Transactions; and  
• 3524 - Audit Committee Pre-approval of Certain Tax Services.   
[END TABLE]
 In addition, The Audit Committee considered the SEC's Release, Strengthening the Commission's Requirements Regarding Auditor Independence, in which the SEC reiterated "its long-standing position that an accounting firm can provide tax services to its audit clients without impairing the firm's independence." 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies 
The Audit Committee has adopted the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-approval Policy (the "Pre-approval Policy"). A summary of the Pre-approval Policy is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Pre-approval Policy describes the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and  Other Permitted services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pre-approvals are typically subject to a dollar limit of $50,000.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The term of any general pre-approval is generally 12 months from the  date of pre-approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves the  services that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Unless a type of service has received general pre-approval and is  anticipated to be within the dollar limit associated with the general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by  the independent registered public accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee will consider whether all services are consistent with the rules on independent registered  public accounting firm independence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best  positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with Aimco's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance Aimco's  ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. Such factors are considered as a whole, and no one factor is necessarily determinative.  
[END TABLE]
All of the services described in the Principal Accountant Fee section above were approved pursuant to the annual engagement letter or in accordance with the Pre-approval Policy.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

Stockholder Engagement Regarding Executive Compensation 
At Aimco's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 99% of the votes cast in the advisory vote on executive compensation (also commonly referred to as "Say on Pay") approved the compensation of Aimco's NEOs as disclosed in Aimco's 2018 proxy statement. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") and Aimco management are pleased with these results and remain committed to extensive engagement with stockholders as part of ongoing efforts to formulate and implement an executive compensation program designed to align the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. 
In 2018 and early 2019, we engaged with stockholders representing over 73% of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2018, as part of our annual process of soliciting feedback on Aimco's executive compensation program. The following chart summarizes the feedback we received, and what actions we have taken in response.

 Overview of Aimco's Pay-for-Performance Philosophy and 2018 Performance Results 
Aimco is a pay-for-performance organization. Aimco starts by setting target total compensation near the median of target total compensation for Aimco's peers as identified on page 33, both as a measure of fairness and also to provide an economic incentive to remain with Aimco. Actual compensation varies from target compensation based on Aimco's results. Each officer's annual cash incentive compensation, "short term incentive" or STI, is based in part on Aimco's performance against corporate, rather than personal, goals. The more senior the officer, the greater the percentage of his or her STI that is based on Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. Aimco's longer term compensation, "long term incentive" or LTI, follows a similar tiered structure. Each officer's LTI is based in part on Aimco's "total shareholder return" or TSR, relative to its peers, with executive officers having a greater share of their LTI based on relative TSR. In the case of Mr. Considine, his entire LTI award is "at risk" based on Aimco's relative TSR. LTI is measured and vests over time, typically a period of four years, so that officers bear longer term exposure to the decisions they make. 
To reinforce its use of Aimco equity for compensation to align management with Aimco stockholders, Aimco also requires substantial equity holdings by executive officers, as described further on page 43. 
Aimco increased NAV per share by approximately 6%, which, with its cash dividend, provided stockholders Economic Income of 8.5%. Aimco accomplished this through solid results in its five areas of strategic focus that provide the foundation for the long-term sustainable profitability we seek for the shareholder capital entrusted to us.

Summary of Executive Compensation Program and Governance Practices 
Below we summarize certain executive compensation program and governance practices – both the practices we have implemented to drive performance and the practices we avoid because we believe they would not serve our stockholders' long-term interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Pays for performance. A significant portion of executive pay is not guaranteed, but rather is at risk and tied to key financial and  value creation metrics that are set in advance and disclosed to stockholders. All of the incentive compensation (both STI and LTI) for Mr. Considine is subject to the achievement of various performance objectives. For the other NEOs, all STI  compensation, and two-thirds of target LTI compensation (other than with respect to the CIO), is subject to the achievement of various performance objectives. A significant portion of the CIO's  compensation is tied to the closing of investment transactions. 
 Balances short-term and long-term incentives. The incentive programs provide a balance of annual and longer-term incentives, with LTI  compensation vesting over multiple years comprising a substantial percentage of target total compensation. 
 Uses multiple performance metrics. These mitigate the risk of the undue influence of a single metric by utilizing multiple performance  measures, that differ for STI and LTI. 
 Caps award payouts. Amounts or shares that can be earned under the STI plan and LTI plan are capped. 
 Uses market-based approach for determining NEO target pay. Target total compensation for NEOs is set near the median for peer  comparators. The Committee reviews the peer comparator group annually. 
 Maintains stock ownership guidelines and holding periods after vesting until ownership guidelines are met. The Company has the  following minimum stock ownership requirements: CEO – lesser of five times base salary or 150,000 shares; CFO – lesser of five times base salary or 75,000 shares; and other executive officers – lesser of four  times base salary or 25,000 shares. All NEOs met these requirements as of January 29, 2019. 
 Includes double-trigger change in control provisions. Equity awards include "double trigger" provisions requiring both a  change in control and a subsequent termination of employment (other than for cause) for accelerated vesting to occur. 
 Uses an independent compensation consulting firm. The Company engages an independent compensation consulting firm that specializes in  the REIT industry. The Committee engages a separate independent compensation consultant. 
 Maintains a clawback policy. In the event of a financial restatement resulting from misconduct by an executive, the clawback policy  allows the Company to recoup incentive compensation paid to the executive based on the misstated financial information. The policy covers all forms of bonus, incentive and equity compensation. 
 Conducts a risk assessment. The Committee annually conducts a compensation risk assessment to determine whether the compensation  policies and practices, or components thereof, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 Acts through an independent Compensation Committee. The Committee consists entirely of independent directors. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Guarantee salary increases, bonuses or equity grants. The Company does not guarantee annual salary increases or bonuses. The Company  makes no guaranteed commitments to grant equity-based awards. 
 Provide excise tax gross-up payments. The Company will not enter into contractual arrangements  that include excise tax gross-up payments. 
 Reprice options. The Company has never repriced the per-share exercise price of any outstanding  stock options. Repricing of stock options is not permitted under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") without first obtaining approval from the stockholders of the  Company. 
 Pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned performance shares. Performance share award agreements provide for the payment of  dividends only if and after the shares are earned. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid once shares are earned. 
 Provide more than minimal personal benefits. The Company does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as  reserved parking spaces. 
[END TABLE]
What We Pay and Why: Components of Executive Compensation 
Total compensation for Aimco's executive officers is comprised of the following components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salary   Cash    Provide a salary that is  competitive with market. 
STI   Cash    Reward executive for  achieving short-term business objectives. 
LTI    Restricted stock, Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") units, and/or  stock options, subject to performance and/or time vesting, typically over four years    Align executive's  compensation with stockholder objectives, and provide an incentive to take a longer-term view of Aimco's performance. 
[END TABLE]
LTI compensation directly ties the interests of executives to the interests of our stockholders, and comprises a substantial proportion of compensation for Aimco NEOs, as follows:

CEO Pay Overview 
The Committee determines the compensation for Mr. Considine. Mr. Considine's target total compensation for 2018 approximated the median for CEOs at Aimco's peers as discussed on page 33. In setting Mr. Considine's target total compensation for 2018, the Committee considered, among other things, the peer group compensation data and Mr. Considine's expertise and experience. The Committee devised a compensation plan for Mr. Considine that resulted in approximately 11% base salary, 24% based on Aimco's   performance against its 2018 corporate goals, and 65% based on relative TSR, making more of Mr. Considine's target compensation tied to TSR than any of his peers. Mr. Considine's target compensation mix is illustrated as follows: 
Fixed Base of Cash Compensation Performance-Based and Not Guaranteed Performance-Based and Not Guaranteed Salary STI - 100% at Risk LTI - 100% at Risk $700,000 $1,500,000 - 2018 Target $4,025,000 - 2018 Target Below 25th Percentile for Peers Based Entirely on Aimco's Performance Against Corporate Goals Based Entirely on Relative Returns Over Forward Looking, Three-Year Period 
How the Committee determines the amount of target total compensation for executive officers 
In addition to reviewing the performance of, and determining the compensation for, the CEO, the Committee also reviews the decisions made by the CEO as to the compensation of Aimco's other executive officers. Base salary, target STI, and target LTI are generally set near the median base salary, target STI, and target LTI for peer comparators. 
How peer comparators are identified 
Aimco considers enterprise Gross Asset Value ("GAV"), as reported by Green Street Advisors, to be an imprecise, but reasonable representation of the complexity of a real estate business and of the responsibilities of its leaders. In addition to GAV, Aimco also reviews other factors, including gross revenues, number of properties, and number of employees, to determine if these factors provide any additional insight into the work and requirements of its leaders. Based on this analysis, Aimco included as "peers" for 2018 compensation the following 20 real estate companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Peer Group   
 Peer Group   
 Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.    Kilroy Realty Corp. 
 Brixmor Property Group, Inc.    Kimco Realty 
 Camden Property Trust    Liberty Property Trust 
 DDR Corp.    Macerich Company 
 Douglas Emmett, Inc.    Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 
 Duke Realty Corp.    Omega Healthcare Investors 
 Extra Space Storage, Inc.    Regency Centers Corp. 
 Federal Realty Investment Trust    Sun Communities, Inc. 
 Healthcare Trust of America, Inc.    Taubman Centers, Inc. 
 Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.    UDR, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
At the time 2018 compensation targets were established, approximately half of these real estate companies had a larger GAV, and approximately half of these real estate companies had a smaller GAV, than does Aimco. Due to changes in GAV, Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. and Sun Communities, Inc. were added to the peer group for 2018 in replacement of Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. For Mr. Kimmel, whose position as Executive Vice President, Property Operations, does not have a good benchmark outside of the multi-family industry, Aimco included as "peers" for 2018 compensation the following six multi-family real estate companies in existence at the time 2018 compensation targets were established: AvalonBay Communities, Inc., Camden Property Trust, Essex Property Trust, Equity Residential, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., and UDR, Inc. These multi-family companies provide useful information to benchmark Mr. Kimmel's position. 
Risk analysis of Aimco's compensation programs 
The Committee considers risk-related matters when making decisions with respect to executive compensation and has determined that neither Aimco's executive compensation program nor any of its non-executive compensation programs create risk-taking incentives that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the organization. Aimco's compensation programs align management incentives with the long-term interests of the Company.

 Limits on STI. The compensation of executive officers and other team members is not overly weighted  toward STI. Moreover, STI is capped. 
 Use of LTI. LTI is included in target total compensation for all officers and typically vests over a  period of four years. The vesting period encourages officers to focus on sustaining Aimco's long-term performance. Executive officers with more responsibility for strategic and operating decisions have a greater percentage of their target total  compensation allocated to LTI. LTI is capped at two times target, or 200%, for the CEO, and 1.67 times target, or 167%, for other NEOs. 
 Stock ownership guidelines and required holding periods after vesting. Aimco's stock ownership  guidelines require all executive officers to hold a specified amount of Aimco equity. Any executive officer who has not yet satisfied the stock ownership requirements for his or her position must retain LTI after its vesting until stock ownership  requirements are met. These policies ensure each executive officer has a substantial amount of personal wealth tied to long-term holdings in Aimco stock. 
 Shared performance metrics across the organization. A portion of STI for all officers and corporate team  members is based upon Aimco's performance against its publicly communicated corporate goals, which are core to the long-term strategy of Aimco's business and are reviewed and approved by the Committee. One hundred percent of  Mr. Considine's STI, and 75% of the STI for the other NEOs, is based upon Aimco's performance against its corporate goals. In addition, having shared performance metrics across the organization reinforces Aimco's focus on a  collegial and collaborative team environment. 
 LTI based on TSR. A portion of LTI for all officers is based on relative TSR. In general, the more  senior level the officer, the greater the percentage of LTI that is based on relative TSR. One hundred percent of Mr. Considine's LTI, and a substantial proportion of the LTI for most of the other NEOs, is based on relative  TSR. 
 Multiple performance metrics. Aimco had six corporate goals for 2018. In addition, through  Aimco's performance management program, Managing Aimco Performance, or MAP, which sets and monitors performance objectives for every team member, each team member has several different individual performance goals that are set at the beginning  of the year and approved by management. Each of the NEOs had an average of six individual goals for 2018. Having multiple performance metrics inherently reduces excessive or unnecessary risk-taking, as incentive compensation is spread among a number  of metrics rather than concentrated in a few. 
[END TABLE]
Total Compensation for 2018 
For 2018, total compensation is the sum of base compensation earned in 2018, STI earned in 2018, and LTI awards granted in 2018. 
Base Compensation for 2018 
For 2018, Mr. Considine's base compensation was $700,000, unchanged from 2017, and well below the median for CEOs of his experience, expertise and tenure. For 2018, base compensation for all other NEOs was $450,000 (an increase from 2017 base compensation of $400,000), near the median base compensation paid by peer comparators for similar positions. 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation for 2018 
The Committee determined Mr. Considine's STI by the extent to which Aimco met six designated corporate goals, which are described below and are referred to as Aimco's Key Performance Indicators, or KPI. 
For the other NEOs, calculation of STI was determined by two components: Aimco's performance against the KPI; and each officer's achievement of his or her individual MAP goals. For example, if an executive's target STI was $400,000 and weighted 75% on KPI, then 75% of that amount, or $300,000, varied based on KPI results and 25% of that amount, or $100,000, varied based on MAP results. As KPI results were 137.24%, then the executive would receive 137.24% of $300,000 ($411,720) for that portion of his STI, and if MAP results were 100%, then the executive would receive 100% of the $100,000, for a total STI payment of $511,720. 
Aimco's KPI reflect Aimco's five areas of strategic focus, as set forth above on page 28. Said another way, Aimco compensates its leadership on executing exactly the same business strategy communicated to stockholders and analysts. Specifically, Aimco's KPI consisted of the following six corporate goals that were reviewed with, and approved by, the Committee, each weighted as described.  CORPORATE GOALS Operational Excellence (25% KPI) Based on 2018 Same Store NOI Redevelopment and Portfolio Management (10% of KPI) Based on redevelopment and development investment and returns, and transactions that enhance Aimco's objectives regarding portfolio quality. Balance Sheet (5% of KPI) Based on leverage ratios and balance sheet activities adding financial flexibility. Team and Culture (10% of KPI) 5% based on team member engagement scores 5% based on on-site engagement, retention and efficiency Financial Results (50% of KPI) Based on AFFO per share 
These goals aligned executive officers with the publicly communicated, long-term goals of the Company without encouraging them to take unnecessary and excessive risks. Threshold performance paid out at 50%; target performance paid out at 100%; and maximum performance paid out at 200%. 
Performance below threshold resulted in no payout. For some goals, where performance was between threshold and target or between target and maximum, the amount of the payout was interpolated.  The following is a tabular presentation of the performance criteria and results for 2018, explained in detail in the paragraphs that follow:

1 Full year Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO") as reported in Aimco's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release dated February 4, 2019, was $2.16 per share, or $0.04 lower. There are a very limited number of items (such as non-recurring income, hurricane related casualty losses, and capital replacement spending in excess of budget) that are unusual, infrequent, or otherwise deemed by management and the Committee to be appropriate to exclude from the calculation of AFFO for purposes of Aimco's compensation plan, in order to avoid unjust rewards and unjust penalties. The additions and subtractions to reported AFFO are reviewed and approved by the Committee. For 2018, this process resulted in a net upward adjustment of $0.04 to reported AFFO. In the past five years, such adjustments have been upward four times and downward one time.  For all numeric goals except for the AFFO Per Share goal, the target performance metrics were Aimco's 2018 budget goals. As set forth below, the AFFO Per Share goal required outperformance to the 2018 budget to achieve any payout. Aimco has a rigorous budgeting process that includes an evaluation of prior performance, market data, and peer performance. Aimco's budget strategy is to set ambitious, achievable goals. Aimco's 2018 performance – which included both Same Store revenue and NOI growth of 3.1% and peer-leading NOI margin of 74.2% – is a reflection of Aimco's effective and successful budgeting strategy. 
An explanation of the objective of each goal and performance levels and payouts for each goal is set forth in the paragraphs below. 
Same Store NOI Achievement (25% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of producing predictable and growing Free Cash Flow through focus on customer selection and satisfaction. For 2018, the range for the Same Store NOI achievement goal was as follows: "Threshold" equated to achievement of three percent unfavorable to 2018 budgeted Same Store NOI; "Target" equated to achievement of 2018 budgeted Same Store NOI; and "Maximum" equated to three percent favorable to 2018 budgeted Same Store NOI. Aimco's Same Store NOI achievement for 2018 was 0.308% favorable to budgeted Same Store NOI. This resulted in a payout on the Same Store NOI achievement goal of 27.57% for each of the NEOs. 
Redevelopment Investment and Returns, and Transactions That Improve Aimco's Portfolio Quality (10% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objectives for redevelopment and portfolio management, two of Aimco's five areas of strategic focus. Large and/or complex redevelopment and development projects provided increased weighting toward the total goal weighting of 10%, with smaller scale projects provided lower weighting toward the total goal weighting. Achievement for each project was determined with reference to the 2018 budgeted investment and scope for the project, and was based on the extent to which the project work was completed on time and within budget, as well as whether expected returns on investment were achieved. For 2018, Aimco invested $176 million in redevelopment projects. Aimco completed construction at Park Towne Place in Center City Philadelphia and at Saybrook Pointe in San Jose; the two projects are on track to create nearly $70 million of value for Aimco stockholders. Aimco made solid progress on its other projects. The project work was on time and within budget. Leasing in 2018 achieved average rents at or above underwriting. Additionally, Aimco purchased: Bent Tree, a 748-apartment home community in Fairfax County, Virginia, for $160 million; four Philadelphia communities, including 665 apartment homes and 153,000 square feet of office and retail space, for $308 million; and Avery Row, a 67-apartment home community in Arlington, Virginia. Aimco sold for $590 million its Asset Management business and four affordable communities located in the Hunters Point area of San Francisco, completing its exit of the affordable business, and sold for $170 million Chestnut Hill Village, an 821-apartment home community located in North Philadelphia. Aimco used proceeds from the two sales to fund previously completed acquisitions, effectively completing the paired trades. The acquisition communities have expected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return approximately 400 basis points higher than those of the disposition communities. The sale of Chestnut Hill Village rebalanced Aimco's capital allocation from a lower-rated apartment community in north Philadelphia to communities in the more desirable Center City and University City submarkets. This resulted in a payout of 20.00% for each of the NEOs. 
Leverage Ratios and Other Balance Sheet Activities Adding Financial Flexibility (5% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of limiting risk through our balance sheet structure. Achievement was based on the ratio of Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA and balance sheet activities that added financial flexibility. Aimco's ratio of Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was 7.2x. Additionally, Aimco reduced 2019-2021 property loan maturities by more than 50%, lowering exposure to possible interest rate increases, providing annual interest savings of $13M, and increasing financial flexibility by adding nearly $1B to its pool of properties that are not encumbered by debt. This resulted in a payout on the balance sheet goal of 10.00% for each of the NEOs. 
Team Member Engagement Scores (5% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to fulfill Aimco's strategic objective of producing a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of Aimco success. Every team member is surveyed via a third-party, confidential survey on his or her annual anniversary of employment. The team member engagement score consists of the average of the responses to the questions that comprise the engagement index, on a scale of 1 to 5, for all team members who complete the survey during the year. For 2018 compensation, the range for team member engagement scores was as follows: "Threshold" equated to 4.00; "Target" equated to 4.20; and "Maximum" equated to 4.75. For 2018, Aimco's team member engagement score was 4.12, resulting in a payout of 4.00% for each of the NEOs. 
On-Site Team Engagement, Retention, and Efficiency (5% of KPI). The primary objective of this goal was to maintain a highly engaged, stable workforce at our communities, enhanced by innovations in efficiency, all of which further Aimco's strategic objective of producing predictable and growing returns from property operations. Achievement was based on on-site team engagement scores, team member retention ratios, and efficiency gains. Aimco's on-site team member engagement score was 4.11 out of 5. On-site voluntary turnover was up 6% year-over-year. Aimco made further efficiency gains in 2018. This resulted in a payout on the on-site engagement, retention, and efficiency goal of 4.00% for each of the NEOs. 
AFFO Per Share (50% of KPI). The primary objective of the AFFO goal was to increase Aimco's current period financial result. Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") defines as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: depreciation and amortization   related to real estate; gains and losses from sales or impairment of depreciable assets and land used in the primary business of the REIT; and income taxes, current or deferred, directly associated with a gain or loss on sale of real estate; and after adjustments for Aimco's share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO in accordance with the guidance set forth by Nareit. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding preferred equity redemption related amounts. Preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP. Aimco excludes preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from its computation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by capital replacements (a proxy for economic depreciation and also adjusted for non-controlling interests) and is Aimco's primary measure of current period performance. 
For 2018 compensation, outperformance to the 2018 budget was required to achieve any payout on the AFFO goal. The range for the AFFO goal, as updated following Aimco's sale of its Asset Management business and four affordable communities in the third quarter of 2018, was set as follows: "Threshold" equated to $2.14 per share; "Target" equated to $2.15 per share; and "Maximum" equated to $2.27 per share. Aimco's AFFO was $2.15 per share.2 This resulted in a payout on the AFFO per share goal of 71.67% for each of the NEOs. 
Due to Aimco's achievement of certain goals and outperformance on others, Aimco's overall KPI performance was 137.24%. Accordingly, each executive officer was awarded 137.24% of the portion of his or her target STI attributable to KPI. 
Various of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined, described and, where appropriate, reconciled to the most comparable financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP under the Non-GAAP Measures heading within Part II, Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards for 2018 
Under the 2018 LTI program, 100% of the LTI award for the CEO, and two-thirds of the LTI awards for Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, are performance-based, or at risk, and measured on a forward looking, three-year performance period. The remaining one-third of the LTI awards granted to Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn in 2018 are time-based, with 25% of the grants vesting on each anniversary of the grant date in the case of Mr. Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, and 100% of the time-based grant vesting on the fourth anniversary of the grant date in the case of Mr. Beldin. In his role as Chief Investment Officer, a significant portion of Mr. Bezzant's compensation is tied to the closing of investment transactions; accordingly, LTI comprises a materially smaller percentage of his target compensation as compared to the other NEOs, and is entirely time-based, with 25% of the LTI award granted to Mr. Bezzant in 2018 vesting on each anniversary of the grant date.

3 Excludes Mr. Bezzant, whose LTI is entirely time-based.  The relative metrics under the performance-based LTI awards granted in 2018 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Relative to NAREIT Apartment Index    -250 bps    +50 bps   +400 bps 
 Relative to MSCI US REIT Index    -350 bps    +50 bps   +500 bps

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The relative metrics above reflect the metrics used for the awards made in 2018 for the performance period  ending on December 31, 2020.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  If absolute TSR were negative, any portion of the LTI award achieved above target would not vest until  absolute TSR is once again positive.  
[END TABLE]
Threshold performance was set to pay out at 50%; target performance was set to pay out at 100%; and maximum performance was set to pay out at 200%. Performance below threshold will result in no payout. If performance is between threshold and target or between target and maximum, the amount of the payout will be interpolated. The performance-based portion of the LTI awards for Messrs. Considine, Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn (i.e., the entire LTI award in the case of Mr. Considine, and two-thirds of the LTI award in the case of Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn) will be determined solely according to the relative TSR metrics set forth above. 
The LTI awards made in 2018 have a forward looking, three-year performance period, with grants vesting 50% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets), and 50% one year later, for a four-year plan from start to finish, illustrated below. 
LTI awards for 2018 were granted on January 30, 2018, in the form of restricted stock and long-term incentive units in our operating partnership (the "LTIP units"). The share award agreements to which the performance-based restricted shares were granted do not provide for the payment of dividends until the shares are earned. Dividends accrue during the performance period. 
For the purpose of calculating the number of shares of restricted stock to be granted to each of Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, the dollar amount allocated to restricted stock was divided by $41.77 per share, which was the average of the closing trading prices of Aimco's Common Stock on the five trading days up to and including the grant date. The five-day average was used to mute the effect of any single day spikes or declines. For the purpose of calculating the number of shares subject to the LTIP units to be granted to Mr. Considine, with respect to 50% of Mr. Considine's LTIP units, which are full-value awards, the dollar amount was divided by $41.77 per share, which was the average of the closing trading prices of Aimco's Common Stock on the five trading days up to and including the grant date. With respect to the other 50% of Mr. Considine's LTIP units, which are appreciation awards, the dollar amount was divided by $8.29, which price was calculated by a third party financial firm with particular expertise in the valuation of such LTIP units; the LTIP units have a conversion price of $40.95, which is equal to the fair market value of Aimco's Common Stock on January 30, 2018 (pursuant to the 2015 Plan, "fair market value" is defined as the closing price of Aimco's Common Stock on the grant date).  NEO Compensation for 2018 
CEO Compensation. Mr. Considine's STI for 2018 was based entirely on Aimco's performance against the six designated corporate goals. Mr. Considine's STI was calculated by multiplying his STI target of $1.5 million by 137.24%, which was the Committee's payout determination having reviewed Aimco's overall performance on the six corporate goals. Mr. Considine's LTI was granted in the form of LTIP units on January 30, 2018, for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, and is entirely at risk, based on relative returns over the performance period. Mr. Considine's 2018 target compensation and incentive compensation is summarized as follows:

(2)  Amount shown reflects a 100% payout that would result from achieving "target" performance. Actual  payout may range from 0% to 200% of this amount depending on performance results over the forward looking, three-year performance period ending December 31, 2020. The number of units that are earned, if any, will vest with respect to 50%  following the end of the three-year performance period and 50% one year later, for a four-year vesting period.  
[END TABLE]
Other NEO Compensation. As noted above, for Messrs. Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, an allocation of the target STI was made as follows: 75% of the target STI was calculated based on Aimco's performance against KPI and 25% of the target STI was calculated based on each executive's achievement of his or her individual MAP goals. As noted above, Aimco's KPI performance was 137.24%. Accordingly, each executive officer was awarded 137.24% of the portion of his or her STI attributable to KPI (i.e., 75% of the target STI amount shown below). 
In determining the MAP achievement component of 2018 STI, Mr. Considine determined that: Mr. Beldin's MAP achievement would be paid at 100% of target for his contributions to finance, accounting, and information technology, and to Aimco's balance sheet; Mr. Bezzant's MAP achievement would be paid at 100% of target for his contributions to portfolio quality; Ms. Cohn's MAP achievement would be paid at 125% for her leadership over legal matters, insurance, risk management, asset quality and service, commercial/ancillary income, compliance, and human resources; and Mr. Kimmel's MAP achievement would be paid at 150% for his contributions to Aimco's operating results, including peer-leading NOI margin and strong results in customer satisfaction and retention. The Committee reviewed Mr. Considine's determinations. As described in detail beginning on page 38, LTI for the other NEOs was granted on January 30, 2018, in the form of restricted stock. Target compensation and incentive compensation for 2018 for the other NEOs is summarized as follows:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Amounts shown reflect the 2018 STI paid to each of Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn. For  Mr. Bezzant, the amount shown includes $511,720 representing 2018 STI and $840,000 representing an incentive payment for Mr. Bezzant's work in negotiating and closing the sale of Aimco's Asset Management business and four  affordable apartment communities in San Francisco, CA, completing the Company's exit of the affordable housing line of business.  
(2)  Comprises one-third of the LTI target for each of Messrs. Beldin and  Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, or the entire LTI target for Mr. Bezzant. The LTI award vests ratably over four years for each of Messrs. Kimmel and Bezzant and Ms. Cohn, or vests in full on the fourth anniversary of the grant date for  Mr. Beldin, and is for the purpose of attracting and retaining key talent integral to the success of Aimco.  
(3)  Comprises two-thirds of the LTI target for each of Messrs. Beldin and  Kimmel and Ms. Cohn. Amounts shown reflect a 100% payout of the performance-based shares resulting from achieving "target" performance. Actual payouts will be in a range of 0% to 200% of these amounts, depending on performance results  for the three-year performance period from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020.  
[END TABLE]
Determination Regarding 2016 Performance Share Awards. As part of the 2016 LTI program, the Company granted performance-share awards that might be earned based on relative TSR as compared to the NAREIT Apartment Index (60% weighting) and the REIT Index (40% weighting) over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2018, with awards vesting 50% following the end of the three-year performance period (based on attainment of TSR targets) and 50% one year later, for a four-year plan from start to finish. On January 29, 2019, the Committee determined that Aimco's three-year TSR was 1,170 basis points higher   than the NAREIT Apartment Index and 1,330 basis points higher than the REIT Index for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2018, resulting in the maximum number of shares being earned at 200% of target. Mr. Bezzant's 2016 performance-share award had two components. Fifty percent of Mr. Bezzant's performance share award was determined according to the relative TSR metrics set forth above, and fifty percent was determined according to success against development objectives. On January 29, 2019, the Committee determined that the development objectives had been achieved at target performance, resulting in the target number of shares being earned, for an overall payout on Mr. Bezzant's performance-share award of 150% of target. Accordingly, for the NEOs, 50% of the earned shares vested on January 26, 2019, and the remaining 50% of the earned shares will vest on January 26, 2020. 
Other Compensation 
From time to time, Aimco determines to provide executive officers with additional compensation in the form of discretionary cash or equity awards. Aimco did not provide any such awards to the NEOs in 2018. 
Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements 
401(k) Plan 
Aimco provides a 401(k) plan that is offered to all Aimco team members. In 2018, Aimco matched 25% of participant contributions to the extent of the first 4% of the participant's eligible compensation. For 2018, the maximum match by Aimco was $2,750, which was the amount that Aimco matched for each of Messrs. Considine, Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn's 2018 401(k) contributions. Aimco provided an additional discretionary match in the amount of $1,000 to all team members in 2019 for Aimco's achievement of greater than 125% on its 2018 corporate goals. Aimco's prior year discretionary match was $400. 
Other than the 401(k) plan, Aimco does not provide post-employment benefits. Aimco does not have a pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan or any other similar arrangements. 
Executive Employment Arrangements 
Replacement of Legacy Employment Agreement. On December 29, 2008, Aimco entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Considine (the "2008 Employment Agreement"). On December 21, 2017, Aimco entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Considine (the "2017 Employment Agreement") to replace the 2008 Employment Agreement. The 2017 Employment Agreement was entered into to reflect current practice and update the terms of Mr. Considine's employment with the Company. In connection with the execution of the 2017 Employment Agreement, Mr. Considine did not receive any additional equity awards or signing bonus. The Committee evaluated the terms of the 2017 Employment Agreement in comparison to those of the CEOs of Aimco's peers and other comparable companies. 
2017 Employment Agreement. The 2017 employment agreement is for a two-year term. The 2017 Employment Agreement provides for a base salary of $700,000, subject to future increase. Mr. Considine also continues to be eligible to participate in the Company's performance-based incentive compensation plan with a target annual short-term incentive award opportunity of not less than $1.4 million (the "Target STI"), and a target long-term incentive award opportunity of not less than $4.025 million, both subject to future increase. 
Pursuant to the 2017 Employment Agreement, upon termination of Mr. Considine's employment by Aimco without cause, by Mr. Considine for good reason, or upon a termination for reason of disability, Mr. Considine is generally entitled to: (a) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) three times the sum of his base salary at the time of termination, and (ii) the Target STI; (b) any short-term incentive bonus earned but unpaid for a prior fiscal year (the "Prior Year STI"); (c) a pro-rata portion of the short-term incentive bonus he would have earned for the year in which the termination occurs, based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance targets (the "Pro Rata STI"); and (d) immediate and full acceleration of any outstanding unvested equity awards, with all outstanding stock options (including options previously vested) remaining exercisable until the expiration of the applicable option term. In the event of Mr. Considine's retirement, Mr. Considine will be entitled to: (a) the Prior Year STI; (b) the Pro Rata STI; and (c) accelerated vesting of outstanding and unvested equity awards, if any, that vest solely on a time basis and continued vesting of all outstanding unvested equity awards that vest based on the achievement of performance targets according to actual achievement of the applicable performance targets. If Mr. Considine's employment is terminated due to his death, Mr. Considine's estate will receive payment of any earned but unpaid base salary and vested accrued benefits, the Prior Year STI, and the Pro Rata STI, and all outstanding equity awards will become immediately and fully vested and be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. 
Under the 2017 Employment Agreement, Mr. Considine is not entitled to any additional or special payments upon the occurrence of a change in control.  In the event payments to Mr. Considine are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the payments will be either (a) delivered in full, or (b) delivered as to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by Mr. Considine of the greater amount on an after-tax basis. 
The 2017 Employment Agreement also contains customary confidentiality provisions, a limited mutual non-disparagement provision, and non-competition, non-solicitation and no-hire provisions. 
None of Messrs. Beldin, Bezzant, or Kimmel or Ms. Cohn has an employment agreement. 
Executive Severance Arrangements 
Aimco has an executive severance policy that provides that Aimco shall seek stockholder approval or ratification of any future severance agreement for any senior executive officer that provides for benefits, such as lump-sum or future periodic cash payments or new equity awards, in an amount in excess of 2.99 times such executive officer's base salary and bonus. Compensation and benefits earned through the termination date, the value of vesting or payment of any equity awards outstanding prior to the termination date, pro rata vesting of any other long-term awards, or benefits provided under plans, programs or arrangements that are applicable to one or more groups of employees in addition to senior executives are not subject to the policy. It has been Aimco's longstanding practice not to provide excessive severance arrangements. 
Executive Severance Policy. On February 22, 2018, the Committee adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company Executive Severance Policy (the "Executive Severance Policy"). The Executive Severance Policy supersedes and replaces any employment agreement or other plan, policy or practice involving the payment of severance benefits to participants under the Executive Severance Policy. The Company's Executive Vice Presidents, as determined on the records of the Company and any other entities through which the operations of the Company are conducted, are eligible to participate in the Executive Severance Policy. Each of Messrs. Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn are participants under the Executive Severance Policy; however, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Considine, is not a participant under the Executive Severance Policy. 
The Executive Severance Policy provides that if the Company terminates a participant's employment without "Cause," or if the participant terminates his or her employment for "Good Reason" (each as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar year of the date of  termination, and (ii) the average annual bonus paid to the participant in the most recent three (3) years; and  
• 18 months of continued health benefits coverage at the Company's expense.  
[END TABLE]
The vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by a participant on the date of termination will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Severance Policy, if the Company terminates a participant's employment without Cause, or if the participant terminates his or her employment for Good Reason, in either case, within the period commencing six months prior to and ending twelve months following a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Executive Severance Policy), then in lieu of the severance benefits described above the participant will be eligible to receive the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to two (2) times the sum of (i) the annual base salary for the calendar  year of the date of termination, and (ii) the average annual bonus paid to the Eligible Executive in the most recent three (3) years;  
• 18 months of continued health benefits coverage at the Company's expense; and  
• 100% accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards then-held by the participant.  
[END TABLE]
The Executive Severance Policy provides that if the employment of the participant is terminated by reason of the participant's death or disability, then the participant will be eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination. In addition, the vesting and exercise of any equity awards held by the participant at the time of his or her death or disability will be determined in accordance with the applicable incentive plan and award agreement. 
In the event that any payment or benefit payable to a participant under the Executive Severance Policy would result in the imposition of excise taxes under the "golden parachute" provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will either be made and/or provided in full or will be reduced such that the excise tax under Section 280G is not applicable, whichever is least economically disadvantageous to the participant. The Executive Severance Policy does not provide for any excise tax or other tax "gross-up" payment.  All severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Policy are subject to applicable withholding obligations, the participant's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, and compliance with certain non-competition, non-disclosure and non-solicitation covenants set forth in a restrictive covenant agreement that is appropriate for the participant's position. 
The Executive Severance Policy will remain in effect, subject to amendment, until terminated by the Board. The Board may terminate or amend the Executive Severance Policy at any time, so long as at least ninety days' prior notice is provided to any participant if the termination or amendment of the Executive Severance Policy would materially or adversely affect the rights of the participant. 
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements 
Effective in January 2002 for Mr. Considine, and in connection with their employment and/or promotions by Aimco for Messrs. Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, Aimco entered into certain non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with each executive. Mr. Considine's 2002 non-competition and non-solicitation agreement was replaced by his 2008 Employment Agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, each of these NEOs agreed that during the term of his or her employment with the Company and for a period of two years following the termination of his or her employment, except in circumstances where there was a change in control of the Company, he or she would not (i) be employed by a competitor of the Company named on a schedule to the agreement, (ii) solicit other employees to leave the Company's employment, or (iii) solicit customers of Aimco to terminate their relationship with the Company. The agreements further required that the NEOs protect Aimco's trade secrets and confidential information. For Messrs. Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, the agreements provide that in order to enforce the above-noted non-competition condition following the executive's termination of employment by the Company without cause, each such executive will receive, for a period not to extend beyond the earlier of 24 months following such termination or the date of acceptance of employment with a non-competitor,(i) non-compete payments in an amount, if any, to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion and (ii) a monthly payment equal to two-thirds (2/3) of such executive's monthly base salary at the time of termination. For purposes of these agreements, "cause" is defined to mean, among other things, the executive's (i) breach of the agreement, (ii) failure to perform required employment services, (iii) misappropriation of Company funds or property, (iv) conviction, plea of guilty, or plea of no contest to a crime involving fraud or moral turpitude, or (v) negligence, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, misconduct or violation of law. 
Equity Award Agreements 
Double Trigger Vesting Upon Change in Control. The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, LTIP unit and/or stock option awards have been granted to Messrs. Considine, Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, as applicable, provide that if (i) a change in control occurs and (ii) the executive's employment with the Company is terminated either by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason, in either case, within twelve months following the change in control, then (a) for time-based options and/or restricted stock, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and/or unvested stock options shall become immediately and fully vested and exercisable, and all vested options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option, and (b) for performance-based options, restricted stock and/or LTIP unit awards, shares, unvested options and/or units will vest based on the higher of actual or target performance through the truncated performance period ending on the date of the change in control, and all vested options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option. 
Accelerated Vesting Upon Termination of Employment Due to Death or Disability. Pursuant to the 2017 Employment Agreement, as set forth above, if Mr. Considine's employment is terminated due to his death or disability, and all outstanding equity awards will become immediately and fully vested and be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. The award agreements pursuant to which restricted stock, LTIP unit and/or stock option awards have been granted to Messrs. Considine, Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn, as applicable, provide that upon a termination of employment due to death or disability, then (a) for time-based options and/or restricted stock, all outstanding shares of restricted stock and/or unvested stock options shall become immediately and fully vested and exercisable, and all vested options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option, and (b) for performance-based options, restricted stock and/or LTIP unit awards, shares, unvested options and/or units will vest based on the higher of actual or target performance through the date of termination, and all vested options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the term of the option. 
Other Benefits; Perquisite Philosophy 
Aimco's executive officer benefit programs are substantially the same as for all other eligible officers and employees. Aimco does not provide executives with more than minimal perquisites, such as reserved parking places. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Required Holding Periods After Vesting 
Aimco believes that it is in the best interest of Aimco's stockholders for Aimco's executive officers to own Aimco stock. Every year, the Committee and Mr. Considine review Aimco's stock ownership guidelines, each executive officer's holdings in light of the stock ownership guidelines, and each executive officer's accumulated realized and unrealized stock option and restricted stock gains.  Equity ownership guidelines for all executive officers are determined as a minimum of the lesser of a multiple of the executive's base salary or a fixed number of shares. The Committee and management have established the following stock ownership guidelines for Aimco's executive officers: 
Any executive who has not satisfied the stock ownership guidelines must, until the stock ownership guidelines are satisfied, hold 50% of after tax shares of restricted stock for at least three years from the date of vesting, and hold 50% of shares acquired upon option exercises (50% calculated after exercise price plus taxes) for at least three years from the date of exercise. 
Each of Messrs. Considine, Beldin, Bezzant, and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn exceeded the ownership targets established in Aimco's stock ownership guidelines as of January 29, 2019. 
Role of Outside Consultants 
The Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Committee. In 2018, the Committee engaged Board Advisory as its independent compensation consultant. At the direction of the Committee, Board Advisory coordinated and consulted with Ms. Cohn and Ms. Johnson regarding executive compensation matters. Board Advisory provided the Committee with an independent view of both market data and plan design. Aimco management has engaged FPL Associates, L.P. ("FPL") to review Aimco's executive compensation plan. Neither Board Advisory nor FPL provided other services to the Company. The Committee has assessed the independence of Board Advisory and FPL pursuant to SEC rules and has concluded that they are independent. 
Base Salary, Incentive Compensation, and Equity Grant Practices 
Base salary adjustments typically take effect on January 1. The Committee (for Mr. Considine), and Mr. Considine, in consultation with the Committee (for the other executive officers), determine incentive compensation in late January or early February. STI is typically paid in February or March. LTI is granted on a date determined by the Committee, typically in late January or early February. 
Aimco grants equity in three scenarios: in connection with incentive compensation, as discussed above; in connection with certain new-hire or promotion packages; and for purposes of retention. 
With respect to LTI, the Committee sets the grant date for the restricted stock, LTIP unit, and stock option grants. The Committee sets grant dates at the time of its final compensation determination, generally in late January or early February. The date of determination and date of award are not selected based on share price. In the case of new-hire packages that include equity awards, grants are made on the employee's start date or on a date designated in advance based on the passage of a specific number of days after the employee's start date. For non-executive officers, as provided for in the 2015 Plan, the Committee has delegated the authority to make equity awards, up to certain limits, to the Chief Financial Officer (Mr. Beldin) and/or Corporate Secretary (Ms. Cohn). The Committee and Mr. Beldin and Ms. Cohn time grants without regard to the share price or the timing of the release of material non-public information and do not time grants for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation. 
2019 Compensation Targets 
Based on comparison to compensation paid to CEOs at Aimco's peers, the Committee set Mr. Considine's target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2019 at $6.725 million. Mr. Considine, in consultation with the Committee, set target total compensation (base compensation, STI and LTI) for 2019 for the other NEOs as follows: Mr. Beldin — $1.07 million; Mr. Bezzant — $0.45 million plus additional incentive awards that he may become entitled to as determined in the future; Ms. Cohn — $2.1 million; and Mr. Kimmel — $1.6 million. Aimco performance will determine the amounts paid for 2019 STI and the portion of LTI awards that vest, and such amounts may be less than, or in excess of, these target amounts. STI will be paid in cash, and LTI granted in January 2019 was in the form of restricted stock, LTIP units and/or stock options. 
Accounting Treatment and Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
The Committee generally considers the accounting treatment and tax implications of the compensation awarded or paid to our executives. Grants of equity compensation awards under our long-term incentive program are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended on December 22, 2017, by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). Under the Tax Act, Section 162(m) will apply to each employee who serves as the Company's principal executive officer or principal financial officer during the taxable year, each other employee of the Company who is among the three most highly compensated officers during such taxable year, and any other employee who was a covered employee of the Company for any preceding taxable year beginning   after December 31, 2016. The Tax Act also eliminated the performance-based compensation exception with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, but includes a transition rule with respect to compensation that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, and not materially modified after that date. The Company has awarded, and will continue to award, compensation as it considers appropriate that does not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m). 
COMPENSATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS 
The Compensation and Human Resources Committee held five meetings during fiscal year 2018. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis with management. Based upon such review, the related discussions and such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement to be delivered to stockholders.

The amounts shown in this column for 2018 include the grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards or LTIP unit awards, as applicable, granted in 2018 based on the probable outcome of the performance condition to which such awards are subject, which was calculated by a third-party consultant using a Monte Carlo valuation model in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Based on the foregoing, the grant date fair value is $41.48 per LTIP unit as to 50% of Mr. Considine's LTI award and $8.29 per LTIP unit as to 50% Mr. Considine's LTI award, $41.71 per share for the performance-based restricted stock awards granted to each of Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn that are based on relative TSR performance, and, solely with respect to Mr. Bezzant, $40.95 per share for a portion if his 2015 LTI award and a portion of his 2016 LTI award, each of which was comprised of performance-based restricted stock awards that were based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on December 31, 2017, and which were determined to be achieved by the Committee on January 30, 2018, and granted on that date. The grant date fair value of the LTIP unit award, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $7,971,034 for Mr. Considine. The grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards that are based on relative TSR performance, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $980,425 for Mr. Beldin, $1,372,562 for Ms. Cohn, and $947,747 for   Mr. Kimmel. The grant date fair value of Mr. Bezzant's performance-based restricted stock award that is based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on December 31, 2017, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $367,526 for Mr. Bezzant.

Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn) granted on January 30, 2018, pursuant to their 2018  LTI award that may be earned – at threshold, target and maximum performance levels – based on relative TSR (60% of each award is based on the Company's TSR relative to the NAREIT Apartment Index and 40% of each award is based on the  Company's TSR relative to the REIT Index) over a three-year period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020, with the number of units or shares earned, if any, vesting 50% on the later of the third anniversary of the grant date or  the date on which performance is determined (but no later than March 15, 2021), and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Solely with respect to Mr. Bezzant, the amounts shown in this column include (i) the portion of his  2015 LTI award comprised of performance-based restricted stock that may be earned — at threshold, target and maximum performance levels — based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on  December 31, 2017, with the number of shares earned (as determined by the Committee on January 30, 2018) vesting 50% on February 12, 2018, and 50% on February 12, 2019; and (ii) the portion of his 2016 LTI award comprised of  performance-based restricted stock that may be earned — at threshold, target and maximum performance levels — based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on December 31, 2017, with the number of  shares earned (as determined by the Committee on January 30, 2018) vesting 50% on January 26, 2019, and 50% vesting on January 26, 2020.

The amounts shown in this column include the grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards or LTIP unit awards, as applicable, based on the probable outcome of the performance condition to which such awards are subject, which was calculated by a third-party consultant using a Monte Carlo valuation model in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Based on the foregoing, the grant date fair value is $41.48 per LTIP unit as to 50% of Mr. Considine's LTI award and $8.29 per LTIP unit as to the remaining 50% of Mr. Considine's LTI award, $41.71 per share for the performance-based restricted stock awards granted to each of Messrs. Beldin and Kimmel and Ms. Cohn that are based on relative TSR performance, and, solely with respect to Mr. Bezzant, $40.95 per share for the performance-based restricted stock awards that are based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on December 31, 2017. The grant date fair value of the LTIP unit award, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $7,971,034 for Mr. Considine. The grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards that are based on relative TSR performance, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $980,425 for Mr. Beldin, $1,372,562 for Ms. Cohn, and $947,747 for Mr. Kimmel. The grant date fair value of the performance-based restricted stock award that is based on the achievement of development objectives for the performance year ending on December 31, 2017, assuming achievement at the maximum level of performance, is $367,526 for Mr. Bezzant.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
The NEOs are entitled to certain severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment or, in the case of a change in control, double trigger accelerated vesting of equity awards in the event of a qualifying termination of employment that occurs within one year following a change in control. These terms of these arrangements are described under "CD&A — Post-Employment Compensation and Employment and Severance Arrangements — Executive Employment Arrangements, Executive Severance Arrangements and Equity Award Agreements" above. 
In the table that follows, potential payments and other benefits payable upon termination of employment and change in control situations are set out as if the conditions for payments had occurred and/or the terminations took place on December 31, 2018. In setting out such payments and benefits, amounts that had already been earned as of the termination date are not shown. Also, benefits that are available to all full-time regular employees when their employment terminates are not shown. The amounts set forth below are estimates of the amounts that could be paid out to the NEOs upon their termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such NEOs' separation from Aimco. The following table summarizes the potential payments under various scenarios if they had occurred on December 31, 2018.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION 
We believe that executive pay should be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our team members to create shareholder value. In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer. The disclosure is required for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The annual total compensation for 2018 for Mr. Considine, our CEO, was $6,773,403, as reported under the heading "Summary Compensation Table." Our median employee's total compensation for 2018 was $68,933. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Considine's 2018 total compensation was approximately 98 times that of our median employee. 
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio was calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining 2018 total compensation, consisting of base salary, annual bonus amounts, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted during 2018) and other incentive payments for all individuals who were employed by the Company on December 31, 2018, other than our CEO. We included all active employees and annualized the compensation for any employees who were not employed by the Company for the full 2018 calendar year. After identifying the median employee based on 2018 total compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the "Total" column in the Summary Compensation Table.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions 
Aimco recognizes that related person transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Aimco's decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is Aimco's preference to avoid related person transactions. Nevertheless, Aimco recognizes that there are situations where related person transactions may be in, or may not be inconsistent with, the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, pursuant to a written policy approved by the Board, has oversight for related person transactions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review transactions, arrangements or relationships in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, (2) Aimco (or any Aimco entity) is a participant, and (3) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than an interest arising solely as a result of being a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction or a less than 10 percent beneficial owner of another entity that is a party to the transaction). The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has also given its standing approval for certain types of related person transactions such as certain employment arrangements, director compensation, transactions with another entity in which a related person's interest is only by virtue of a non-executive employment relationship or limited equity position, and transactions in which all stockholders receive pro rata benefits. 
Sublease of a Portion of Aimco Office Space 
On January 25, 2019, Aimco entered into a sublease agreement (the "Sublease") with an entity in which Mr. Considine has sole voting and investment power. Under this agreement, Aimco has subleased to said entity approximately 2,957 square feet of office space within the same building as Aimco's corporate headquarters, and consisting of excess space not needed by Aimco, on exactly the same terms as Aimco leases the space. The Sublease does not provide any benefit to the entity, as other space in the building requires comparable rent. The Sublease provides some benefit to Aimco as it gives Aimco a head start on putting that space to productive use. The entity has a lease term less favorable than Aimco's lease with the landlord, in that Aimco has the option to terminate the Sublease at any time, for any or no reason, upon six months' notice. The Sublease has a term that begins on April 1, 2019 and ends on April 30, 2029, the same term as the Aimco lease. The annual amount of rent in the first year is $78,361, subject to annual increases. The   aggregate amount of rent expected to be paid under the Sublease, assuming the entire lease term is fulfilled, is approximately $850,000. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the Sublease and determined that it is in the best interests of Aimco and its stockholders. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires Aimco's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of Aimco's equity securities, to file reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5) of stock ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of Aimco's registered equity securities are required by SEC regulations to furnish Aimco with copies of all such forms that they file. 
Based solely on Aimco's review of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and the amendments thereto received by it for the year ended December 31, 2018, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required to be filed by those persons, Aimco believes that during the period ended December 31, 2018, all filing requirements were complied with by its executive officers and directors. 
Stockholders' Proposals. Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at Aimco's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 must be received by Aimco, marked to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, no later than November 16, 2019, to be included in Aimco's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. Proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement. Nominations for directors pursuant to "proxy access" provided for in the Company's bylaws must adhere to the terms of the bylaws and will be considered untimely if received by the Company before October 17, 2019, or after November 16, 2019. Proposals of stockholders submitted to Aimco for consideration at Aimco's annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020 outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 (i.e., the procedures for placing a stockholder's proposal in Aimco's proxy materials) will be considered untimely if received by the Company before January 1, 2020, or after January 31, 2020. 
Other Business. Aimco knows of no other business that will come before the Meeting for action. As to any other business that comes before the Meeting, the persons designated as proxies will have discretionary authority to act in their best judgment. 
Available Information. Aimco files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statements or other information that the Company files at the SEC's public reference room in Washington, D.C. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference rooms. The Company's public filings are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and on the internet site maintained by the SEC at "http://www.sec.gov." Reports, proxy statements and other information concerning the Company also may be inspected at the offices of the New York Stock Exchange, 20 Broad Street, New York, New York 10005. 
This Proxy Statement is dated March 1, 2019. You should not assume that the information contained in the Proxy Statement is accurate as of any date other than that date.
