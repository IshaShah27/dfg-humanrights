   The Corporate Governance Committee collaborates with Exelon's Board Chair to determine the appropriate mix of skills and characteristics that our Board requires. The Board has determined that the current composition and size of the Board is appropriate for Exelon, considering the Company's size, geographic scope, and need to access a wide range of views and backgrounds to reflect the diversity and complexity of our business and the markets and communities we serve. There are 13 nominees for Director at the 2019 annual meeting. 
[END TABLE]
The Exelon Board of Directors
Director Qualifications and Nomination
Effective oversight of Exelon's strategic direction requires our Board to be composed of diverse individuals who possess attributes and core competencies important to our Company. The Corporate Governance Committee identifies and recommends Director nominees for election to the Board and periodically retains a board search firm to assist with the identification of potential candidates.
The Board values the diversity of thought that arises from Directors possessing different backgrounds, gender, age, race, and geographic experiences. The Board also deeply values the enhanced and thoughtful deliberations resulting from a balance of short- and long-tenured Directors who provide a mix of fresh perspectives and new ideas with deep and important utility, regulated industry and business cycle experiences.
The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board determine the appropriate mix of skills and characteristics required to meet the needs of the Board as a whole, taking into account the short- and long-term strategies of the Company to determine the current and future skills and experiences required of the Board. All candidates should demonstrate the following attributes to qualify for Board service:

Board and Corporate Governance Matters
And in addition, the Board as a whole, should reflect core competencies in the following areas that are described below in our skills matrix. The matrix identifies the primary skills, core competencies and other attributes that each independent Director brings to bear in their service to Exelon's Board and Committees. Each Director possesses numerous other skills and competencies that are not identified below, however, we believe identifying primary skills is a more meaningful presentation of the key contributions and value that each independent Director brings to their service on the Board and to Exelon shareholders.
SUMMARY OF INDIVIDUAL DIRECTOR PRIMARY SKILLS, CORE COMPETENCIES AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The following matrix identifies the primary skills, core competencies and other attributes that each independent Director brings to bear in their service to Exelon's Board and Committees.                           
   Accounting – Accounting and financial reporting experience are important to accurately and transparently measure and report financial and operating performance, ensure compliance with applicable law and assess financial merits of strategic opportunities.● ● ● ● ●     Finance – Corporate finance and capital management experience is important to effectively oversee the financial affairs of Exelon's businesses and operations.● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●     Executive – CEO/executive management leadership skills are important to gain a practical understanding of organizations, corporate governance, and drivers of individual growth and development.● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●     Compensation – Human capital management and executive compensation knowledge and experience help Exelon recruit, retain, and develop key talent essential to Company operations.● ● ● ● ● ●     Technology – Innovation and technology experience is important in overseeing Exelon's business in the rapidly changing energy markets and physical and cyber threats.● ● ●     Safety & Security – Safety, physical security, and cybersecurity competencies are critical to oversee safe and secure nuclear and other generation operations, transmission and distribution systems, and our other assets.● ● ●     Industry – Industry experience and knowledge of Exelon's businesses help inform our views on energy markets and economics, technology, nuclear power, renewable and clean energy, electric and gas transmission and distribution and the public policy and public safety implications of these aspects.● ● ● ● ● ●     Policy – Government, public policy and regulatory insights are important to help shape public policy initiatives and government regulation for the benefit of our shareholders and customers.● ●     Risk – Risk oversight and management experience inform Exelon's enterprise risk management of key risks with potential to impact public safety, operations and shareholder value including its environmental impacts.● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●     Investor perspective – Investor relations and investment management experience ensures strong alignment with investors and informs decision making on value-adding initiatives.● ● ● ● ● ●     Engineering & Manufacturing – Engineering, manufacturing, construction, and performance management experience inform Exelon's ongoing commitment to maintaining and strengthening the reliability, resiliency, and safety of the electric and gas transmission and distribution systems, smart grid and generation portfolio and assets.● ●     Diversity – Diverse attributes reflect the Company's commitment to diversity and inclusion through age, ethnicity, gender, race and sexual orientation.● ● ●  [END TABLE]
Director Independence
The Board has determined that all non-employee Directors who served on the Board in 2018 and all nominees for election, except for Mr. Crane as Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, are independent according to applicable law and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as incorporated into the Independence Standards for Directors in Exelon's Corporate Governance Principles. In accordance with the Independence Standards for Directors, the Board determined that certain categories of relationships as set forth in the Appendix do not create a conflict of interest that would impair a Director's independence. The Board also determined that the members of the Audit, Compensation and Leadership Development, and Corporate Governance Committees are independent within the meaning of applicable laws, NYSE listing standards, and the Independence Standards for Directors.

Board and Corporate Governance Matters
When assessing the independence of Director nominees, the Corporate Governance Committee considers the impact that tenure may have on the independence of certain longer-tenured incumbent Board nominees. The Board determined that the independence of our longer-tenured Directors had not been diminished, and that such members continued thoughtfully to challenge and provide reasoned, balanced, and insightful guidance to management. The Board values the perspectives that such Directors contribute to Board discussions, having served Exelon during various industry developments, mergers, and with different management teams over the years.
Related Person Transactions
Exelon has adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Under the policy, the Board reviews transactions, arrangements, or relationships with related persons in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. In general, related persons are directors and executive officers and their immediate family members, as well as stockholders beneficially owning 5% or more of Exelon's outstanding stock. The Office of Corporate Governance presents relevant information on transactions, arrangements, and relationships disclosed to Exelon's General Counsel for a determination as to the existence of a related person transaction as defined by SEC rules and the policy. Identified related person transactions are submitted to the Board for approval. The Board may approve any related person transactions deemed to not be contrary to the best interests of Exelon. There were no related person transactions identified for 2018.
Director Nominees
The Board nominates the 13 candidates named below for re-election as Directors. If elected by shareholders, each Director will serve a term ending with the 2020 annual meeting. Each nominee has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve as a Director, if elected. If any Director is unable to stand for election at the annual meeting, the Board may reduce the number of Directors or designate a substitute. In that case, shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute Director. Exelon does not expect that any Director nominee will be unable to serve.
John Rogers announced his decision to not stand for election at the 2019 annual shareholders meeting. The Board is deeply appreciative of John's valued contributions and insights into Exelon's business and strategy and fulfillment of responsibilities to shareholders, employees, customers and communities.
In addition to the skills, characteristics, core competencies and other attributes previously described, the Corporate Governance Committee also considers whether each nominee has the time available, in light of other business and personal commitments, to effectively serve on Exelon's Board. Among the criteria the Committee considers is the degree to which any incumbent Director nominee demonstrates effective and productive preparedness and engagement. The Board has adopted limits for service on other boards, providing that Directors who serve as the CEO of a public company should not serve on more than two other public company boards in addition to Exelon and its subsidiary boards. Other Directors should not serve on the boards of more than four other public companies in addition to the Exelon Board and its subsidiary boards.
The Board is aware that some institutional investors have adopted vote policies that include board service limits more restrictive than Exelon's limits based on 1) resource challenges that make it impractical for investors to assess thousands of individual director nominees or 2) a risk assessment involving statistical data measuring average time required for board service and especially in the event of a crisis. Such investor policies apply a one-size-fits-all approach that may not take into account all relevant facts and circumstances for a particular individual director, including the results of a robust individual director assessment process, such as Exelon has in place for its directors. Exelon's individual director assessment process provides for peer reviews by each director and by four members of senior management that regularly interact with the Board (see page 23). The individual director assessment conducted of Stephen Steinour in 2019 reflected heightened attention to this known concern and the results are included as part of Mr. Steinour's biographical information on page 16.
The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe the skills and experiences detailed above are well represented among the Director nominees and reflect an effective mix of backgrounds, experience and diversity.

As a matter of policy, the Board believes that separation of these functions is not required, and whether to combine the roles or not is a matter for the Board's sole discretion, taking into consideration the current and anticipated circumstances of the Company, the skills and experiences of the individual or individuals in question, and the leadership composition of the Board.
The Board reviews its leadership structure periodically and as circumstances warrant. The Board separated the roles of Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer in 2012 upon the completion of its merger with Constellation Energy Group and named Mayo Shattuck as Board Chair and Christopher Crane as President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon. We find that this leadership structure ensures independent oversight and promotes the Board's ability to effectively represent the best interests of all shareholders.
The Board is committed to continued independent oversight at all times and our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the independent members of the Board shall select and elect a Lead Independent Director in the event the Board Chair and Chief Executive role are held by the same individual, or the person holding the role of Board Chair is not independent under Exelon's Independence Standards for Directors. At any time during which the position of Lead Independent Director may be required but is vacant due to timing considerations, the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee shall serve as the Lead Independent Director.
Exelon's Corporate Governance Principles provide a full outline of the responsibilities for each of the Board Chair, Chief Executive Officer, and any Lead Independent Director.
Board Committees
There are six standing committees of the Board: the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, the Finance and Risk Committee, the Generation Oversight Committee and the Investment Oversight Committee. The Board Chair and CEO generally attend all Committee meetings and all Committees meet regularly in executive session without management present.
Each Committee is governed by a Board-approved charter stating its responsibilities, that is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. The charters were last amended on January 30, 2018 (Finance and Risk, Generation Oversight and Investment Oversight Committee charters) and July 24, 2018 (Audit, Compensation and Leadership Development, and Corporate Governance Committee charters), and are available on the Exelon website at www.exeloncorp.com on the Governance page under the Investors tab. The charters are available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy from Exelon's Corporate Secretary as described on page 65 of this proxy statement.

Director Education
The Board has an orientation and onboarding program for new Directors and provides continuing education for all Directors that is overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 New Director Orientation  The orientation program is tailored to the needs of each new Director depending on his or her level of experience serving on other boards and knowledge of the Company or industry acquired before joining the Board. Materials provided to new Directors include information on the Company's vision, strategic direction, financial matters, corporate governance practices, Code of Business Conduct, and other key policies and practices. New Directors also meet with the CEO, senior executives and members of their staff for briefings on the executives' responsibilities, programs and challenges. New Directors are also invited for tours of various Company facilities, depending on their orientation needs. Incumbent Directors are also invited to participate in site visits. 
 Continuing Director Education  Continuing director education is provided during portions of Board and Committee meetings and is focused on topics necessary to enable the Board to consider effectively issues before them at that time (such as new regulatory or accounting standards). The education often takes the form of "white papers" covering timely subjects or topics that a Director can review before the meeting. The Audit Committee plans for at least one meeting a year in which a session is devoted to education on new accounting rules and standards and topics deemed to be helpful to having a good understanding of our accounting practices and financial statements. The Generation Oversight Committee uses site visits as a regular part of education for its members by holding each of its meetings at a different generating station (nuclear, fossil or hydro). Each Generation Oversight Committee meeting agenda includes a briefing by local plant management, a tour of the facility, and lunch with plant personnel. 
 Director Education Seminars  Continuing director education also involves individual Directors' attendance at education seminars and programs sponsored by other organizations. The Company covers the cost for any Director who wishes to attend external programs and seminars on topics relevant to their service as Directors. 
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance Principles
Our Corporate Governance Principles, together with the articles of incorporation, bylaws, Committee charters, and other policies and practices, provide the framework for the effective governance of Exelon. The Corporate Governance Principles address matters including the Board's responsibilities and role; Board structure, Director selection, evaluation, and other expectations; Board operations; Board Committees; and additional matters such as succession planning, executive stock ownership requirements, and our recoupment policy. The Corporate Governance Principles are reviewed periodically and were last amended in January 2018 to reflect evolving governance trends and to remain contemporary with the needs of the Company and its stakeholders.
Process for Communicating with the Board
Shareholders and other interested persons can communicate with any Director or the independent Directors as a group by writing to them, c/o Thomas S. O'Neill, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Exelon Corporation, 10 South Dearborn Street, P.O. Box 805398, Chicago, Illinois 60680-5398. The Board has instructed the Corporate Secretary to review communications initially and transmit a summary to the Directors and to exclude from transmittal any communications that are commercial advertisements, other forms of solicitation, general shareholder service matters or individual service or billing complaints. Under the Board policy, the Corporate Secretary will forward to the Directors any communication raising substantial issues. All communications are available to the Directors upon request. Shareholders may also report an ethics concern with the Exelon Ethics Hotline by calling 1-800-23-Ethic (1-800-233-8442). You may also report an ethics concern via email to EthicsOffice@ExelonCorp.com.

Directors' Compensation
Compensation of Non-Employee Directors
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding its non-employee Director compensation program. The Committee is authorized to engage outside advisors and consultants in connection with its review and analysis of Director compensation and takes various factors into consideration, including responsibilities of Directors generally, Board leadership roles such as the Board Chair and Committee Chairs, and the form and amount of compensation paid to Directors at comparable companies.
The Board targets total Director compensation to be at the median level of compensation paid at the peer group of companies used to benchmark executive compensation. The non-employee Director compensation program comprises two components -cash fees and equity compensation.
Cash Fees
The following table sets forth the cash compensation paid in 2018 to Exelon's non-employee Directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Non-Employee Director       $   125,000   Directors may elect to defer any portion of cash compensation into a non-qualified multi-fund deferred compensation plan. Under the plan, each Director has an unfunded account where the dollar balance can be invested in one or more of several mutual funds, including one fund composed entirely of Exelon common stock. Fund balances (including amounts invested in the Exelon common stock fund) are settled in cash and may be distributed in a lump sum or in annual installment payments upon a Director reaching age 65, age 72, or upon departure from the Board. These funds are identical to those that are available to Company employees who participate in the Exelon Employee Savings Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Equity Compensation
A significant portion of Director compensation is paid in the form of equity to align the interests of Directors with the interests of shareholders. In 2018, Exelon's non-employee Directors received deferred stock units valued at $145,000 that are paid quarterly in arrears. Deferred stock units are credited to a notional account maintained on the books of the Company at the end of each calendar quarter based upon the closing price of Exelon common stock on the day the quarterly dividend is paid. Deferred stock units earn dividend equivalents at the same level and time that dividends are paid on shares of Exelon common stock. Dividend equivalents are reinvested in the deferred stock accounts as additional stock units. Deferred stock units are settled in shares of Exelon common stock and may be distributed in a lump sum or in annual installments upon reaching age 65, age 72, or upon a Director's departure from the Board.
Based upon the Corporate Governance Committee's review of peer benchmarking completed in December 2018, the Board approved an increase in the value of directors' deferred stock units to $155,000 per year, effective January 2019 and made no other changes.
Other Benefits Provided
From time to time, Exelon Directors are invited to bring spouses or guests to Exelon or industry related events. When such invitations are extended, Exelon covers the cost of spousal or guest travel, meals, lodging and related activities. The value of spousal or guest related travel is calculated according to IRS regulations and imputed to the Director as additional taxable income. Directors also receive reimbursement to cover the additional taxes owed on such imputed income. However, in most cases there is no direct incremental cost to Exelon of providing transportation and lodging for a Director's spouse or guest when he or she accompanies the Director, and the only additional costs to Exelon are those for meals and activities and to reimburse the Director for the taxes on the imputed income. In 2018, there were no incremental costs to the Company for such benefits and reimbursements paid to cover additional taxes are detailed in footnote 1 to the 2018 Director Compensation table below.

   Proposal 2: Ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Exelon's Independent Auditor for 2019 
   The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have determined that retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to be the independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders based on consideration of the factors set forth below. PwC has served as the Company's independent auditor since the Company's formation in 2000. During this time, PwC has become deeply familiar with the Company's operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting. The Committee believes this experience and expertise to be valuable to the Company and its shareholders. Representatives of PwC will attend the annual meeting to answer questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee considers the independence, qualifications, compensation and performance of the independent auditor on an ongoing basis. In 2018, as part of a continued focus on its governance of its assessment process, management developed a framework to assist the Audit Committee with its assessment of the independent audit firm and to ensure the appropriateness of the firm's fees.
As part of its annual review of the retention of PwC as the Company's independent auditor, the Audit Committee considers both the continued independence of PwC and whether retaining PwC is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Using the framework developed by management, the Audit Committee assessed the following matters:

Table of Contents
Audit Committee Matters
Based on the results of the annual evaluation, the Audit Committee found PwC to be independent from the Company and its management, and appointed PwC as its independent auditor for 2019. If shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment, but no assurance can be given that the Audit Committee will change the appointment.
Pre-approval Policies
The Audit Committee has a policy for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services. Under this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor taking into account the nature, scope, and projected fees of each service as well any potential implications for auditor independence. The policy specifically sets forth services that the independent auditor is prohibited from performing by applicable law or regulation. Further, the Audit Committee may prohibit other services that in its view may compromise, or appear to compromise, the independence and objectivity of the independent auditor. Predictable and recurring audit and permitted non-audit services are considered for pre-approval by the Audit Committee on an annual basis.
For any services not covered by these initial pre-approvals, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Audit Committee Chair to pre-approve any audit or permitted non-audit service with fees in amounts less than $500,000. Services with fees exceeding $500,000 require full Committee pre-approval. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on the actual services provided by and fees incurred with the independent auditor. No services were provided pursuant to the de minimis exception to the pre-approval requirements contained in the SEC's rules.
Auditor Fees
The table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by PwC for the audit of Exelon's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.
Report of the Audit Committee
Management has primary responsibility for preparing the Company's financial statements and establishing effective internal controls over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), the Company's independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2018, is responsible for auditing those financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PwC the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, including the critical accounting policies applied by the Company in the preparation of these financial statements and PwC's evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed pursuant to PCAOB standards and had the opportunity to ask PwC questions relating to such matters. PwC has provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and PCAOB-required letter regarding its communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the firm's independence.
In reliance on these reviews and discussions and other information considered by the Committee in its judgment, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in Exelon Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

 We have regulated operations that consist of six utility subsidiaries, serving approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers, more than any other company in the industry. Our operational performance is generally top quartile or better across numerous metrics such as the frequency and duration of outages. We have significantly improved the operational performance of PHI since the 2016 acquisition consistent with our long-term strategy to increase investment in regulated assets for the benefit of our customers.  We also operate a competitive generation business that comprises one of the largest and cleanest electric generation businesses in the country and the largest competitive retail supply business serving wholesale, commercial, and industrial customers. We are the largest producer of emissions-free energy in the U.S. and are a best-in-class operator in terms of outage days and operating costs for our nuclear fleet.

Exelon's Executive Compensation Program Philosophy and Objectives
The goal of our executive compensation program is to retain and reward leaders who create long-term value for our shareholders by delivering on objectives that support the Company's long-term strategic plan, as shown below.
The design of our executive compensation program is based on aligning the incentives of our high-quality leaders, who effectively manage a company of Exelon's size and complexity, with the interests of our shareholders. This is accomplished by using metrics and goals that are directly linked to the Company's strategy and performance.
We believe that the consistent execution of our strategy over multi-year periods drives long-term shareholder value creation. Moreover, our program is structured to motivate measured, but sustainable and appropriate, risk-taking.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Manage for the Long-term The Board manages for the long-term and makes pay decisions that are in the best long-term interests of the Company and shareholders.  Alignment with Shareholders Compensation is directly linked to performance and is aligned with shareholders by having approximately 80% of NEO pay at risk in both short-and long-term incentives.  Extensive Shareholder Engagement We engage directly with shareholders and take responsive actions to improve our compensation programs based on year-round feedback.

 Market Competitive Our NEOs' pay levels are set by taking into consideration multiple factors including peer group market data, internal equity comparisons, experience, succession planning, performance and retention.  Stock Ownership Guidelines Executives are required to meet and maintain significant stock ownership requirements. Since 2016, our CEO's requirement is 6X base salary, while other NEOs are 3X base salary. See page 43 for current ownership details.  Balance The portion of NEO pay at risk rewards the appropriate balance of short- and long-term financial and strategic business results.

AIP Goal Rigor and Process Used to Set Goals
The 2018 EPS "Target" goal was set at $3.07, which was 47 cents above actual results for 2017, and 2 cents above the midpoint of our publicly disclosed 2018 earnings guidance range set at the beginning of the year. Operational "Target" metrics for 2018 were set at challenging levels that corresponded to top quartile performance compared to industry standards.
Building on the 2018 goal rigor, the Compensation Committee set an adjusted (non-GAAP) operating EPS* AIP target for 2019 at a level higher than the Company's actual performance in 2018, which is generally aligned with the midpoint of our publicly disclosed 2019 financial guidance. For the 2019 operational goals, "Distinguished" targets were set at levels that outperform the historical achievement of Company metrics for three of the four operational metrics:
Exelon's goal-setting process employs a multi-layer approach and analysis that incorporates a blend of objective and subjective business considerations and other analytical methods to ensure that the goals are sufficiently rigorous. Such considerations include:

Compensation Decisions - Roles of Board, Compensation Committee, CEO and Independent Compensation Consultant
Setting Target Total Direct Compensation (TDC) for the CEO…
One of the Compensation Committee's most important responsibilities is to recommend the CEO's target total direct compensation to the independent Directors of the Board. The Compensation Committee fulfills this responsibility by analyzing peer group compensation and performance data with its independent compensation consultant. The Committee also reviews the various elements of the CEO's compensation in the context of the target TDC which includes base salary, annual and long-term incentive target opportunities.
…and for Our NEOs
The Compensation Committee also approves target TDC for our other NEOs. In doing so, the Compensation Committee considers input from the CEO and analyzes a variety of data to gauge market competitiveness, including peer group compensation and performance data with its independent compensation consultant. TDC can vary by named executive officer based on competencies and skills, scope of responsibilities, the executive's experience and performance, retention, succession planning and the organizational structure of the businesses (e.g., internal alignment and reporting relationships).
Role of the Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee retains the services of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian), an independent compensation consultant to support its duties and responsibilities. Meridian provides advice and counsel on executive and director compensation matters and provides information and advice regarding market trends, competitive compensation programs, and strategies including as described below.
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the independence of Meridian, and approves its fees and other retention terms. In 2018, Meridian provided no other services for Exelon or its affiliates. Fees paid to Meridian were less than 1% of its gross annual revenues.

Peer Groups Used for Benchmarking Executive Compensation
We use a blended peer group for assessing our executive compensation program that consists of two sub-groups: energy services peers and general industry peers. We use a blended peer group because (1) there are not enough energy services peers with size, scale and complexity comparable to Exelon to create a robust energy services-only peer group, and (2) Exelon's market for attracting talent includes general industry peers, with recent key executives hired from companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Proctor & Gamble. When selecting general industry peers, we look for capital asset-intensive companies with size, scale and complexity similar to Exelon, and we also consider the extent to which they may be subject to the effects of volatile commodity prices similar to Exelon's sensitivity to commodity price volatility. Exelon evaluates its peer group on an annual basis in July and adjusts for changes with our energy and general industry peers when needed. For 2019, Exelon will take into account the bankruptcy filing of PG&E and the expected spin-off of DowDuPont.
Exelon's revenues are at the 80th percentile of the following blended peer group comprising 20 companies.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 American Electric Power Company, Inc.  Dominion Energy, Inc.  Duke Energy Corporation   
 Edison International  Entergy Corporation  FirstEnergyCorporation   
 NextEra Energy, Inc.  PG&E Corporation  Public ServiceEnterprise Group Inc.

[END TABLE]
Because there is a correlation between the size of an organization and its compensation levels, market data is statistically adjusted using a regression analysis. This commonly applied technique allows for a more precise estimate of the market value of Exelon given the size/scope of responsibility for Exelon's executive roles. Each element of NEO compensation is then compared to these size-adjusted medians of the peer group.
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote Outcome and Shareholder Engagement
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews executive compensation, taking into consideration input received through Exelon's regular and ongoing practice to engage with its investors. Feedback is typically solicited throughout the year in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders and the Compensation Committee's review of the executive compensation program.
During 2018, Exelon contacted the holders of nearly 40% of our outstanding shares. Portfolio managers and governance professionals that accepted our offer to engage included a significant cross-section of our shareholder base, representing approximately one-third of Exelon's outstanding shares. The Chair of Exelon's Compensation Committee participated in many of the discussions held with shareholders in 2018, and feedback received was shared with the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, and the Board.
No substantive changes to our executive compensation program were requested through our engagement discussions. Feedback indicated that investors remain supportive of Exelon's executive compensation program and design as demonstrated by our 2018 say-on-pay vote result of 93%.

2018 Target Compensation for Named Executive Officers
The table below lists the target value of the compensation elements for each NEO as of December 31, 2018. An explanation of the promotion-related adjustments provided to Mr. Nigro and Ms. Pramaggiore is disclosed below this table.
Promotion-Based Compensation Adjustments
Mr. Nigro and Ms. Pramaggiore each received adjustments to their compensation components including base salary and annual and long-term incentive target awards based on market data for their new positions.
Performance share cycles: Consistent with 2018 promotion-based award methodology, Mr. Nigro and Ms. Pramaggiore also received incremental awards to bring their target values to $1,600,463 for the two outstanding performance share cycles of 2016-2018 and 2017-2019.
Beginning in 2019, executives who are promoted during the first six months of the year will receive an adjustment to only that year's current performance share award to reflect the increased scope and responsibilities for the new role.
The accounting impacts of the promotion-related awards are reflected in the Summary Compensation table on page 46, as well as the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 49.
2018 Retention RSU award: Mr. Nigro also received a retention-related award granted in January 2018 with a grant date fair market value at $1,533,200.
Cash Compensation
The Compensation Committee sets base salaries for each NEO, which salaries may be adjusted following an annual market assessment of peer group compensation. When evaluating whether a NEO's base salary should be adjusted, the Compensation Committee considers a number of factors, including the outcome of the annual merit review, the results of the annual market assessment of NEO compensation, job promotion, individual performance, scope of responsibility, leadership skills and values, current compensation, internal equity, and legacy matters.
In January 2018 as part of its annual merit review, the Compensation Committee approved a 2.5% increase in base salary, in line with prior years, for each NEO in his/her role as of that date, effective March 1, 2018.

Other Compensation
As discussed on page 30 under 2018 Leadership Changes, Mr. Thayer assumed the role of Chief Transformation Officer in May 2018 before he left the Company in January 2019 to pursue another opportunity. In this role, Mr. Thayer was focused on leading the critical work of optimizing Exelon's costs, efficiencies and effectiveness in overall operations. These efforts resulted in a total cost savings of more than $900 million achieved since 2015, as reported by the Company in the third quarter of 2018. In November 2018, Exelon announced its commitment to drive another $200 million of gross annual cost savings by 2021. Mr. Thayer led the effort that identified these additional future cost savings in a manner that the Compensation Committee determined had exceeded the expectations and responsibilities of his position and that such accomplishments were not reflected in his AIP award for 2018. The Committee therefore awarded Mr. Thayer a $275,000 bonus in recognition of his leadership to transform Exelon's businesses and the results achieved. See Bonus column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 46.
2018 Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP)
The Compensation Committee grants equity incentive awards annually at its meeting in January. On January 29, 2018, the Committee approved awards of RSUs and performance shares shown in detail in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 49. As discussed on page 36 each element of total direct compensation, including the annual equity incentive awards, is determined for each NEO based on market data, and the executive's competencies and skills, scope of responsibilities, experience and performance, retention, succession planning and the organizational structure of the businesses. When the total target equity incentive award is determined, the value is split between RSUs (33%) and performance shares (67%).
Restricted Stock Units (33% of total award). RSUs granted to NEOs vest ratably over three years. Dividend equivalents with respect to RSUs are reinvested as additional RSUs and are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying RSUs.
Performance Shares (67% of total award). A target number of PShares was granted in January 2018 to each NEO, the earning of which is contingent on performance for the three-year period ending on December 31, 2020. The following equally-weighted performance measures underlying these awards include Utility Net Income, Utility Earned ROE, and Exelon FFO/Debt, which are the same performance metrics underlying the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles. The 2016-2018 performance cycle was the last cycle that reflected a transition to the use of one three-year performance cycle that began in 2016. In addition to the financial measures shown below, any awards earned are then subject to a total shareholder return modifier that factors in the relative performance of Exelon compared to the performance of the UTY index. See page 42 for the rationale behind the selection of the performance goals used for PShares.

The following table shows how the payout formula was calculated and actual PShare amounts awarded.
Pursuant to the terms of the long-term incentive program, all NEOs that have achieved 200% or more of their stock ownership targets (as described on page 43) receive PShare award payouts in cash. All NEOs except for Mr. Thayer achieved 200% of their stock ownership target. Other PShare participants who have not achieved 200% of their stock ownership targets receive PShare award payouts settled 50% in shares of Exelon common stock and 50% in cash.
Long-Term Incentive Program Goal-Setting Process
The Compensation Committee strives to set challenging financial performance targets that drive and motivate executives to achieve long-term success, shareholder value, and to help ensure key talent is retained. For the LTIP program, the Compensation Committee selects metrics that are directly tied to the Company's financial strategies and are proven measures of long-term value creation. Financial targets are based on our internal business plans and external market factors.
Goal-Setting for 2019-2021 Performance Share Award Cycle
To ensure adequate rigor for the financial targets applicable to the 2019-2021 PShare performance cycle, we conducted statistical simulations to understand the level of difficulty of our payout range. We conducted a sensitivity analysis of reasonable value ranges for several internal and external variables that are significant drivers of performance, and we also examined historical levels of deviation of Company performance compared to plan.
PShare Goal Setting
The three-performance metrics underlying the 2019-2021 PShare awards include the following: 
The Utility Earned Return on Equity (ROE) and Utility Net Income use interpolation between threshold, target, and distinguished levels of performance whereas the Funds From Operations (FFO)/Debt metric uses a "stair-step" approach with no interpolation between the performance levels. Performance will be evaluated at the end of 2021 after the completion of the three-year performance period. This design aspect was implemented as part of the Company's transition to the use of three-year performance periods.
PShare targets were set based on external commitments and/or probabilistic modeling. The performance scale range for the Utility ROE and Utility Net Income metrics was based on the following probability levels of achievement: 95% for threshold and 5% for distinguished and the target is aligned with projected performance. The target for the Exelon FFO/Debt metric is aligned with the expectations of credit rating agencies.
To safeguard the confidentiality of our long-term outlook on projected performance outcomes in light of changes in our industry and with our peer companies, as well as the overall utility and power generation markets, we do not disclose actual targets applied to the performance share unit cycles until the cycles have been completed. This maintains the propriety of our policy to only issue annual performance guidance externally.

Governance Features of Our Executive Compensation Programs
Stock Ownership and Trading Requirements
To strengthen the alignment of executive interests with those of shareholders, VPs and above of the Company are required to own certain multiples of base salary of Exelon common stock by the later of five years following (1) an adjustment made to the guidelines (last made in 2012) or (2) his or her hire date or promotion to a new position. As of the annual measurement date of September 30, 2018, all NEOs except for Mr. Thayer had exceeded 200% of their stock ownership guidelines, as shown in the following chart.
The following types of ownership count towards meeting the stock ownership guidelines: restricted shares and restricted stock units, shares held in the Exelon Deferral Plan, dividend reinvestment plan, 401(k) Employee Savings Plan, and common shares beneficially owned directly or indirectly. For additional details about NEO stock ownership, please see the Beneficial Ownership Table on page 62.
Exelon requires executive vice presidents and above who wish to sell Exelon common stock to do so only through the adoption of a stock trading plan meeting the requirements of SEC Rule 10b5-1(c). This requirement is designed to enable officers to diversify a portion of their holdings in excess of the applicable stock ownership requirements in an orderly manner as part of their personal financial plans. The use of Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans serves to reduce the risks that such transactions will be viewed negatively or as commentary with respect to the future value of Exelon's stock. In addition, the use of Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans are believed to reduce the potential for accusations of trading on the basis of material, non-public information, which could damage the reputation of the Company. Exelon's Insider Trading Policy does not permit short sales, derivative transactions involving Exelon stock, hedging or pledging.
Recoupment (Clawback) Policy
The Board of Directors revised its recoupment policy in 2018 to broaden the discretionary ability to clawback incentive compensation when deemed appropriate. Under the policy, the Board has sole discretion to recoup incentive compensation if it determines that:
The Board or Compensation Committee may also seek to recoup incentive compensation paid or payable to current or former incentive plan participants if, in its sole discretion, the Board or Compensation Committee determine that:

Compensation Discussion & Analysis
In addition, the terms of the annual incentive plan provide that the Compensation Committee and management may curtail awards if there is a "significant event," which is defined as a single, high-profile event caused by a failure of Exelon that is determined to have been directly or indirectly caused by a human error or poor management attention. Significant events may include a single high-profile outage or another event that may result in negative customer and media impact or a significant adverse governmental or regulatory action.
The Compensation Committee may also apply negative discretion to unvested equity incentive awards if a significant event or other occurrence is determined to have a similar impact on the Company. Similarly, the terms of the long-term incentive plan provide that the Compensation Committee may amend or adjust the performance measures or other terms and conditions of outstanding awards in the event of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in law or accounting principles.
Risk Management Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
The Compensation Committee reviews Exelon's compensation policies and practices as they relate to the Company's risk management practices and risk-taking incentives. In 2018, the Compensation Committee partnered with Exelon's Enterprise Risk Management group to apply the enterprise risk management policy and framework to the compensation risk assessment process to assess and validate that the controls in place continued to mitigate incentive compensation risks.
Following this assessment, the Committee believes that the risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Exelon. In this regard, the Compensation Committee considered the following compensation program features, which balance the degree of risk taking.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The annual incentive plan includes multiple incentive performance measures with a balance of financial and non-financial metrics. 
● Long-term incentives include multiple vehicles and performance metrics and three-year overlapping performance periods that are aligned with long-term stock ownership requirements. 
● Incentive metrics, performance goals, and capital allocation require multiple approval levels and oversight. 
● Total compensation pay mix includes effective and market aligned balance of short- and long-term incentive compensation elements. 
● Incentive compensation is balanced by formulaic and discretionary funding.  
● Short- and long-term incentive awards contain award caps or modifiers.   
● Reasonable change-in-control and severance benefits are within common market norms. 
● Clawback provisions exceed regulatory mandates. 
● Consistent and meaningful stock ownership requirements create sustained and consistent ownership stakes. 
[END TABLE]
Tax Consequences
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was signed into law and included significant changes to expand the scope of the executive compensation rules in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code that limit deductible compensation to $1 million for covered employees. Pursuant to the Tax Act, the types of compensation subject to the $1 million limitation has been expanded beyond salary, restricted stock and RSUs to include performance-based compensation such as AIP and PShare awards. The Tax Act also expanded the definition of covered employee to include the CFO and sustains the classification as a covered employee in perpetuity even after death through severance and post-death payments. Finally, the application of the $1 million limitation has been expanded to include covered employees at Exelon's corporate registrants with publicly traded debt in addition to those with publicly traded equity as required prior to the Tax Act. Under the new law, Exelon has eight registrants that now fall within the scope of Section 162(m). The IRS and Treasury have issued a preliminary notice to assist with interpreting the technical aspects of the new law and expect to issue regulations in 2019 to provide further guidance.

Pension Benefits
Exelon sponsors the Exelon Corporation Retirement Program, a defined benefit pension plan that covers certain management and unionized employees. The Program includes the Service Annuity System (SAS), a traditional pension plan covering certain employees who commenced employment prior to January 1, 2001, and a cash balance pension plan (CBPP) covering management and certain unionized employees hired after January 1, 2001, as well as certain other management employees who elected to participate.
Exelon also sponsors the Pension Plan of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. (Constellation Pension Plan), which covers certain legacy Constellation employees. It includes a traditional pension formula for employees hired before January 1, 2000, and a pension equity formula (PEP) for employees hired thereafter or who elected to participate in that formula.
In furtherance of Exelon's efforts to align to the market and control pension costs and liabilities, the CBPP was closed to non-represented, non-craft employees hired on or after February 1, 2018, at Exelon Generation (including Constellation) or BSC. In lieu of pension benefits, these employees will receive an additional non-discretionary contribution to the Exelon Savings Plan. Each of these plans is intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. An employee can participate in only one of these plans.
For NEOs participating in the SAS, the annuity benefit payable at normal retirement age is equal to the sum of 1.25% of the participant's earnings as of December 25, 1994, reduced by a portion of the participant's Social Security benefit as of that date, plus 1.6% of the participant's highest average annual pay, multiplied by the participant's years of credited service (up to a maximum of 40 years). Pension-eligible compensation for the SAS's Final Average Pay Formula includes base pay and annual incentive awards. Benefits under the SAS are vested after five years of service.
The "normal retirement age" under the SAS is 65. The plan also offers an early retirement benefit prior to age 65, which is payable if a participant retires after attainment of age 50 and completion of 10 years of service. The annual pension payable under the plan is determined as of the early retirement date, reduced by 2% for each year of payment before age 60 to age 58, then 3% for each year before age 58 to age 50. In addition, under the SAS, the early retirement benefit is supplemented prior to age 65 by a temporary payment equal to 80% of the participant's estimated monthly Social Security benefit. The supplemental benefit is partially offset by a reduction in the regular annuity benefit.
Under the cash balance pension, a notional account is established for each participant, and the account balance grows as a result of annual benefit credits and annual investment credits. (Employees who participated in the SAS prior to January 1, 2001 and elected to participate in the cash balance plan also have a frozen transferred benefit from the former plan and received a "transition" credit based on their age, service and compensation at the time of transfer.) Beginning January 1, 2008, the annual benefit credit under the plan is 7% of base pay and annual incentive award and beginning January 1, 2013 for employees hired on or after such date, the annual benefit credit is equal to a percentage of base pay and annual incentive award which varies between 3% and 8%, based upon age. Beginning in 2017, the annual investment credit is the third segment spot rate of interest on long-term investment grade corporate bonds. The segment rate will be determined as of November of the year for which the cash www.exeloncorp.com     51
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation Data balance account receives the investment credit. Cash balance participants with pre-2008 balances receive an additional benefit credit ranging from 0.5% to 3.5% based on their pre-2008 service. Also, beginning in 2017, account balances for employees hired prior to January 1, 2013 will be subject to a minimum investment credit of 4%. For employees hired on or after January 1, 2013, the annual investment credit is the second segment spot rate of interest on corporate bonds, determined as of November of the year for which the cash balance account receives the investment credit, subject to a minimum annual investment credit rate of 3.8% and a maximum annual investment credit rate of 7%. Benefits are vested after three years of service and are payable in an annuity or a lump sum at any time following termination of employment. Apart from the benefit credits and the vesting requirement, and as described above, years of service are not relevant to a determination of accrued benefits under the cash balance pension plans.
For NEOs who participate in the PEP, a lump sum benefit amount is computed based on covered earnings multiplied by a total credit percentage. Covered earnings are equal to the average of the highest three of the last five twelve-month periods' base pay plus annual incentive awards. The total service credit percentage is equal to the sum of the credit percentages based on the following formula: 5% per year of service through age 39, 10% per year of service from age 40 to age 49, and 15% per year of service after age 49. No benefits are available under the PEP until a participant has at least three years of vesting service. Benefits payable under the PEP are paid as an annuity unless a participant elects a lump sum within 60 days after separation.
The Code limits to $275,000 the individual 2018 annual compensation that may be taken into account under the tax-qualified retirement plan. As permitted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Exelon sponsors three supplemental executive retirement plans (or SERPs) that allow the payment to a select group of management or highly-compensated individuals out of its general assets of any benefits calculated under provisions of the applicable qualified pension plan which may be above these limits. The SERPs offer a lump sum as an optional form of payment, which includes the value of the marital annuity, death benefits and other early retirement subsidies at a designated interest rate. The interest rate applicable for distributions to participants in the SAS in 2018 is 2.77%. For participants in the cash balance pension plan and the PEP, the lump sum is the value of the non-qualified account balance. The values of the lump sum amounts do not include the value of any pension benefits covered under the qualified pension plans, and the methods and assumptions used to determine the non-qualified lump sum amount are different from the assumptions used to generate the present values shown in the tables of benefits to be received upon retirement, termination due to death or disability, involuntary separation not related to a change in control, or upon a qualifying termination following a change in control which appear later in this proxy statement.
Under the terms of the SERPs, participants are provided the amount of benefits they would have received under the SAS, cash balance plan, ETP or PEP, as applicable, but for the application of the Code limits. In addition, certain executives previously received grants of additional credited service under a SERP. In particular, in 1998, Mr. Crane received an additional 10 years of credited service through September 28, 2008, the date of his tenth anniversary, as part of his employment offer that provided one additional year of service credit for each year of employment to a maximum of 10 additional years.
As of January 1, 2004, Exelon does not grant additional years of credited service to executives under the SERP for any period in which services are not actually performed, except that up to two years of service credits may be provided upon a qualifying termination of employment under severance or change in control agreements first entered into after such date, and performance-based grants or grants which make up for lost pension benefits from another employer may be (but have not been) provided. Service credits previously available under employment, change in control or severance agreements or arrangements (or any successor arrangements) are not affected by this policy.
The amount of the change in the pension value for each of the NEOs is the amount included in the Summary Compensation Table above. The present value of each NEO's accumulated pension benefit is shown in the following tables. The present value for cash balance and PEP participants is the account balance. The assumptions used in estimating the present values for SAS participants include the following: pension benefits are assumed to begin at each participant's earliest unreduced retirement age; the SERP lump sum amounts are determined using the rate of 5% for SAS participants at the assumed retirement age; the lump sum amounts are discounted from the assumed retirement date at the applicable discount rates of 3.62% as of December 31, 2017 and 4.31% as of December 31, 2018; and the applicable mortality tables. The applicable mortality table is the RP 2000-based table projected generationally using Exelon's best estimate of long-term mortality improvements. The December 31, 2018 mortality table is consistent with the mortality used in the Exelon December 31, 2018 pension disclosure.

Deferred Compensation Programs
Exelon offers deferred compensation plans to permit the deferral of certain cash compensation to facilitate tax and retirement planning and satisfaction of stock ownership requirements for executives and key managers. Exelon maintains non-qualified deferred compensation plans that are open to certain highly-compensated employees, including the NEOs.
The Exelon Deferred Compensation Plan and the Constellation Deferred Compensation Plan are non-qualified plans that permit their respective legacy executives and key managers to defer receipt of base compensation and the Company to credit related matching contributions that would have been contributed to the Exelon Corporation Employee Savings Plan (the Company's tax-qualified 401(k) plan) but for the applicable limits under the Code. The Deferred Compensation Plans permit participants to defer taxation of a portion of their income and benefit the Company by deferring the payment of a portion of its compensation expense, thus preserving cash.
The Exelon Employee Savings Plan is intended to be tax-qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Exelon maintains the Employee Savings Plan to attract and retain qualified employees, including the NEOs, and to encourage employees to save some percentage of their cash compensation for their eventual retirement. The Employee Savings Plan permits employees to do so and allows the Company to make matching contributions in a relatively tax-efficient manner. The Company maintains the excess matching feature of the Deferred Compensation Plans to enable key management employees to save for their eventual retirement to the extent they otherwise would have were it not for the limits established by the IRS.
The Stock Deferral Plan is a non-qualified plan that permitted legacy Exelon executives to defer performance shares prior to 2007.
The following table shows the amounts that NEOs have accumulated under both the Deferred Compensation Plans and the Stock Deferral Plan. The Exelon Deferred Compensation and Stock Deferral Plans were closed to new deferrals of base pay other than excess Employee Savings Plan deferrals in 2007. Existing balances will continue to accrue dividends or other earnings until payout upon termination. Balances in the Deferred Compensation Plans will be settled in cash upon the termination event selected by the officer and will be distributed either in a lump sum, or in annual installments. Share balances in the Stock Deferral Plan continue to earn dividend equivalents to those available to all shareholders, which are reinvested as additional notional shares in the plan. Balances in the plan are distributed in shares of Exelon stock in a lump sum or installments upon termination of employment.

Executive Compensation Data
Once officers who participate in the Employee Savings Plan reach their statutory contribution limit during the year, their elected payroll contributions and Company matching contribution will be credited to their accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plans. The investment options under the Deferred Compensation Plans consist of a basket of investment fund benchmarks substantially the same as those funds available through the Employee Savings Plan. Deferred amounts represent unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Change in control employment agreements and severance plan covering NEOs
Background
The Compensation Committee reviews Exelon's change in control and severance benefits policies to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with competitive practice. In reviewing the policies, the Compensation Committee considers the advice of its compensation consultant. The Exelon benefits currently include multiples of change in control benefits ranging from two times base salary and annual bonus for corporate and subsidiary vice presidents to 2.99 times base salary and annual bonus for the CEO and other NEOs. In 2009, the Compensation Committee eliminated excise tax gross-up payment provisions in any senior executive employment, change in control, or severance plans, programs or agreements first entered into, adopted or materially amended on or after April 2, 2009 (other than arrangements assumed pursuant to a corporate transaction). In 2016, any NEOs covered by change in control agreements, which previously included excise tax gross-up provisions, agreed to waive those payments and agreements were later amended to remove such gross-up payments. Therefore, no NEO is currently entitled to an excise tax gross-up payment upon any termination of employment from Exelon.
NEOs have entered into individual change in control employment agreements, which generally protect such executives' position and compensation levels for two years after a change in control of Exelon. The agreements are initially effective for a period of two years, and provide for a one-year extension each year thereafter until cancellation or termination of employment.

Quantification of Payments upon a Change in Control
During the 24-month period following a change in control, or, during the 18-month period following a "significant corporate transaction", meaning one that affects an executive's business unit in which Exelon shareholders retain between 60% and 66% control, if a NEO resigns for good reason or if an executive's employment is terminated by Exelon other than for cause or disability, the executive is entitled to the following:
Change in control benefits are also provided if an executive is terminated other than for cause or disability, or terminates for good reason (1) after a tender offer or proxy contest commences, or after Exelon enters into an agreement which, if consummated, would cause a change in control, and within one year after such termination a change in control does occur, or (2) within two years after a sale or spin-off of the executive's business unit in contemplation of a change in control that actually occurs within 60 days after such sale or spin-off (a disaggregation).
A change in control under the individual change in control employment agreements generally occurs: 
"Good reason" under the individual change in control employment agreements generally includes any of the following occurring within two years after a change in control or disaggregation or within 18 months after a significant corporate transaction:
www.exeloncorp.com     55
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation Data
"Cause" under the change in control employment agreements generally includes any of the following:
If the amount payable to a NEO under a change in control agreement, inclusive of other parachute payments, would cause an excise tax to be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, the payments to such executive shall be reduced to the maximum amount below which no such tax is imposed or, if the payment without such reduction would leave the executive with a greater amount after payment of such excise taxes, then no such reduction shall be applied.
If a NEO resigns for good reason or is terminated by Exelon other than for cause or disability, in each case under circumstances not involving a change in control or similar provision described above, the NEO may be eligible for the following non-change in control benefits under the Exelon Corporation Senior Management Severance Plan:
Payments under the Senior Management Severance Plan are subject to reduction by Exelon to the extent necessary to avoid imposition of excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code on excess parachute payments or under similar state or local law.
"Good reason" under the Senior Management Severance Plan means either of the following:
"Cause" under the Senior Management Severance Plan generally has the same meaning as the definition of such term under the individual change in control employment agreements.
Benefits under the change in control agreements and the Senior Management Severance Plan are subject to termination upon an executive's violation of his or her restrictive covenants, and incentive payments under the agreements and the plan may be subject to the recoupment policy adopted by the Board of Directors.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of annual total compensation, calculated pursuant to SEC rules, of our median employee and our CEO, Christopher M. Crane. For 2018, the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 126:1, demonstrating Exelon's commitment to balance equitable compensation stewardship with competitively based compensation that drives and rewards performance. The total annual compensation for Mr. Crane and the median employee is $15,600,000 and $124,000, respectively.
The rules governing the CEO Pay Ratio allow for utilization of the same individual for a 3-year period, provided that employee is actively employed at the company. As such, Exelon used the same individual identified in 2017 that was included in the compilation of our CEO pay ratio as reported in the 2018 proxy. The methodology utilized to identify that person is described below.
On December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 34,972 individuals (excluding the CEO), which includes two employees based in the United Kingdom and eight employees based in Canada. We have chosen to exclude these ten employees as permitted under SEC rules from our determination of the "median employee," given the small number of our non-US based employees. The consistently applied compensation measure we used to identify the median employee was W-2 Box 1 wages for employees as of December 31, 2018. After identifying the median employee, the annual total compensation for the median employee was calculated using the same methodology used in compiling the Summary Compensation Table found on page 46 in this proxy statement for our NEOs. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We believe the methodology, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the ratio are reasonable given our specific employee population.
Because SEC rules provide flexibility in determining the methodology, assumptions, and estimates used to determine pay ratios and the fact that workforce composition issues differ significantly between companies, comparability of pay ratios amongst companies may be limited.

   Proposal 4: Shareholder Proposal from Burn More Coal 
   The proponent represents Burn More Coal, a special interest group supportive of the coal industry, a business that Exelon departed years ago as it was uneconomic and not aligned with our strategic interests. The Board is confident that this proposal and the views of Burn More Coal do NOT represent the views of Exelon or its stakeholders. 
   The Board of Directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal from Burn More Coal.   
[END TABLE]
Resolved:
Shareholders request that, beginning in 2019, Exelon publish an annual report of actually incurred company costs and associated actual/significant benefits accruing to shareholders, public health and the environment from the company's environment-related activities that are voluntary and exceed federal/state regulatory requirements. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost and omit proprietary information.
Supporting Statement:
Exelon's purpose is to generate profits from generating affordable and reliable electricity for ratepayers while obeying applicable laws and regulations.
Electricity from existing coal plants costs less than any new source of power generation per the U.S. Department of Energy's National Coal Council 2018 report, "Power Reset" (www.BurnMoreCoal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NCC-Power-Reset-2018.pdf).
Yet Exelon has divested from coal and, according to its web site, is investing in a "cleaner energy future," apparently in hopes of altering global climate change. No law or regulation requires that Exelon take this action.
This resolution is intended to help shareholders, going forward, monitor whether Exelon's voluntary activities and expenditures touted as protecting the public health and environment are actually producing meaningful benefits to shareholders, public health and the environment.
Corporate managements sometimes engage in "greenwashing" — i.e., spending shareholder money on schemes ostensibly environment-related, but really undertaken merely for the purpose of improving the public image of management.
Such insincere "green" posturing and associated touting of alleged, but actually imaginary benefits to public health and the environment may harm shareholders by distracting management, wasting corporate assets, ripping off ratepayers and deceiving shareholders and the public.
For example, Exelon boasts on its web site that it plans to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 15 million tons per year by 2020. To attain this goal, Exelon states it divested from coal and invested in nuclear, wind, solar and hydro-generating capacity. Shareholders should have an honest accounting of this action's cost and the action's actual and current (vs. hypothetical or imagined) benefits. After all, Exelon's reduction in CO2 emissions is not an obvious benefit to anyone or anything.
Global CO2 emissions are higher now than ever and increasing. Coal will remain the dominant fuel globally for electricity through at least 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. China is reportedly now adding coal plant capacity equal to the entire US coal fleet. There are reportedly 1,600 coal plants under construction around the world. So what are the actual benefits to ratepayers, shareholders and the environment of achieving Exelon's goal? By how much, in what way, and when will any of Exelon's activities actually reduce or alter climate change?

Stockholder Proposal
The information requested by this proposal is not already contained in any Exelon report.
Exelon should report to shareholders what are the specific actual benefits produced by its voluntary, highly touted and costly environmental activities. Are the touted benefits real and worthwhile? Or are they just greenwashing? Shareholders want to know.
Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to Proposal from Burn More Coal
The Exelon Board considered the proposal and concluded that the preparation of an annual report on the "costs and actual benefits related to the Company's environmental activities" as described in the proposal would have no value to Exelon's shareholders. In the first instance, Exelon divested its coal generation over the last two decades because running the divested plants was not in our economic or strategic interest. Our value proposition has long reflected this reality. Second, the proposal asks Exelon to undertake the technically impossible task of measuring and reporting on the impact of a single company's actions to address global climate change. Further, the proposal's supporting statement suggests that Exelon's strategy to embrace technology and innovation to create value for our customers, communities, and shareholders by providing safe, clean, reliable, and affordable power and energy services is not based on economic and scientific fact. We disagree.
Worldwide scientific consensus is overwhelming that global climate change is real and that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) from human activities are the cause. Environmental sustainability has been a core value and business driver for Exelon since our company's beginning, and global climate change is a key sustainability issue for our business, our stakeholders and society at large. As the largest producer of clean and reliable energy in the United States, accounting for one-ninth of all clean energy produced, we have a responsibility to manage our environmental impacts. Given the potential impacts of climate change on the electric sector, Exelon must consider not only how to respond to the need to reduce GHG emissions, but also how our business may be affected by the physical impacts of climate change.
Climate change implications for the electric sector range from changes in demand for energy and grid disruptions to supply shortages and market disturbances from new policy or legislation. The adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change strengthened momentum to hold the increase in global average annual temperature to less than 2°Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2050. Based on best available scientific estimates, this increase represents the maximum acceptable change in global average temperatures that can occur if the world is to have a chance of limiting potentially catastrophic climatic effects on the earth's environment.
Nations and companies have been evaluating potential strategies to reduce GHG emissions in support of meeting the 2° Celsius limit recommended by the Paris Agreement and other organizations such as the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures. Experts have developed recommendations for specific sector contributions to this reduction, based on current emissions trajectories and potential for reductions.
In this vein, Exelon previously set and achieved two corporate-wide GHG emission reduction goals over the past decade. Through these two programs — Climate Leaders and Exelon 2020 — we reduced more than 9 million metric tons of GHG emissions from 2001 to 2008, improved our building energy efficiency level by 25 percent by 2012, and avoided another 1.5 billion metric tons of GHG emissions through our customer energy efficiency programs and nuclear generation during that same time. In 2018, we announced a third corporate GHG emission reduction goal that is focused on reducing GHG emissions related to our internal operations by another 15 percent by 2022, compared to a 2015 baseline. Our new goal is focused on GHG emissions associated with our buildings, fleet vehicles, processes and equipment that emit GHGs.
Through our focus on operational excellence, we work to maximize the performance of our low-carbon generation fleet to meet customer demands. We strive to enhance our customer energy efficiency programs and modernize our infrastructure to reduce both emissions associated with power generation and line losses and to ensure that our infrastructure remains resilient in the face of changing weather conditions. And we are continuously engaged in exploring new and emerging technologies to further drive emissions reductions in these areas, in addition to advocating for regulatory and market policies that support the clean evolution of the electric supply.

Shareholder Proposals
If you wish to submit a proposal for possible inclusion in next year's proxy statement, you must submit it in writing to the Corporate Secretary, Exelon Corporation, 10 South Dearborn Street, P.O. Box 805398, Chicago, Illinois 60680-5398. Exelon must receive your proposal no earlier than October 22, 2019 or later than November 21, 2019. Exelon will consider only proposals meeting the requirements of the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under our bylaws, the proposal must also disclose fully all ownership interests the proponent has in Exelon and contain a representation as to whether the shareholder has any intention of delivering a proxy statement to the other shareholders of Exelon.
We strongly encourage any shareholder interested in submitting a proposal to contact our Corporate Secretary in advance of this deadline to discuss the proposal, and shareholders may want to consult knowledgeable counsel with regard to the detailed requirements of applicable securities laws. Submitting a shareholder proposal does not guarantee that we will include it in our proxy statement. Our Corporate Governance Committee reviews all shareholder proposals and makes recommendations to the Board for action on such proposals.
Additionally, under our bylaws, for a shareholder to bring any matter before the 2020 annual meeting that is not included in the 2020 proxy statement, the shareholder's written notice must be received by the Corporate Secretary no earlier than October 22, 2019 or later than November 21, 2019.
Director Nominations
A shareholder who wishes to recommend a candidate (including a self-nomination) to be considered by the Corporate Governance Committee for nomination as a Director must submit the recommendation in writing to the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Thomas S. O'Neill, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Exelon Corporation, 10 South Dearborn Street, P.O. Box 805398, Chicago, Illinois 60680-5398. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider all recommended candidates and self-nominees when making its recommendation to the full Board of Directors to nominate a slate of Directors for election.
A shareholder may also use one of two alternative provisions of Exelon's bylaws to nominate a candidate for election as a Director. Under one provision of the bylaws currently in effect, a shareholder must comply with the following: (1) notice of the proposed nomination must be received by Exelon no earlier than October 22, 2019 or later than November 21, 2019; (2) the notice must include information required under the bylaws, including: (a) information about the nominating shareholder, (b) information about the candidate that would be required to be included in a proxy statement under the rules of the SEC, (c) a representation as to whether the shareholder intends to deliver a proxy statement to the other shareholders of Exelon, and (d) the signed consent of the candidate to serve as a Director of Exelon, if elected. Under this procedure, any shareholder can nominate any number of candidates for director for election at the annual meeting, but the shareholder's nominees will not be included in Exelon's proxy statement or form of proxy for the meeting.
A shareholder who meets criteria in the Exelon bylaws may also nominate a limited number of candidates for election as Directors through provisions commonly referred to as "proxy access." Subject to the requirements set forth in the bylaws, any shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders holding both investment and voting rights with respect to at least 3% of Exelon's outstanding common stock continuously for at least 3 years may nominate up to 20% of the Exelon Directors to be elected (two Directors on Exelon's current Board of 13 Directors). The nominating shareholder(s) must comply with the following, among other detailed requirements specified in the bylaws: (1) notice of the proposed nomination and other required information must be received by

Frequently Asked Questions
Election of Directors: Majority Vote Policy
Under our bylaws, Directors must be elected by a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. This means that the number of votes cast "for" a Director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the nominee. An abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the vote because an abstention does not count as a vote cast. In contested elections, the vote standard would be a plurality of votes cast, in which case a withhold vote would have no effect on the vote's outcome. In either case, broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote because they are not considered votes cast.
Our bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election, each Director nominee must submit to the Board before the annual meeting a letter of resignation that becomes effective only if the Director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting. The resignation of a Director nominee who is not an incumbent Director is automatically accepted by the Board. The resignation of an incumbent Director is tendered to the independent Directors of the Board for a determination of whether or not to accept the resignation. The Board's decision and the basis for the decision would be disclosed within 90 days following the certification of the final vote results.
Ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Independent Auditor
The appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as Exelon Corporation's independent auditor requires an affirmative vote of a majority of shares of common stock represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote thereon in order to be adopted. An abstention will have the effect of a vote "against" the ratification of the independent auditor. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment.
Executive Compensation
Under our bylaws, whenever any corporate action is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized upon receiving an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, and abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" the action. However, the vote on executive compensation is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Board of Directors, or the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee in any way, as provided by law. Our Board and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee will review the results of the vote and input from shareholders and will take them into account in making a determination concerning executive compensation consistent with our record of shareowner engagement.
Shareholder Proposal from Burn More Coal
The adoption of the shareholder proposal requires an affirmative vote by a majority of the shares represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?
As of the date this proxy statement went to press, we knew of no matters to be raised at the annual meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement.
Who will count the votes?
Representatives of Broadridge Financial Communications and Exelon's Office of Corporate Governance will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of the election.
Where can I find the voting results?
We will report the voting results in a Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days following the end of our annual meeting.
Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
Exelon will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by Directors, officers or employees in person or by telephone, electronic transmission and facsimile transmission. We have hired Morrow Sodali to distribute and solicit proxies. We will pay Morrow Sodali a fee of $20,000 plus reasonable expenses for these services.

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures
Exelon reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and supplements its reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share, earned ROE, and FFO/Debt to enhance investors' understanding of Exelon's performance. Our method of calculating adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings and operating ROE may not be comparable to other companies' presentations.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items, including mark-to-market adjustments from economic hedging activities, unrealized gains and losses from nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, certain costs associated with plant retirements and divestitures, costs related to a cost management program, and other items as set forth in the table below reconciling adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings from GAAP earnings, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management uses adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings as one of the primary indicators to evaluate performance, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and plan and forecast future periods. We believe the measure enhances an investor's overall understanding of period over period financial results and provides an indication of Exelon's baseline operating performance by excluding items that are considered by management to not be directly related to the ongoing operations of the business.
The table below reconciles reported GAAP Earnings per share to adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings per share for 2018 (amounts may not add due to rounding).
Earned ROE is calculated using adjusted (non-GAAP) operating earnings, reflecting all lines of business for the utility businesses (electric distribution, gas distribution, transmission), divided by average shareholder's equity over the year. Management uses operating ROE as a measurement of the actual performance of the company's utility business.
FFO/Debt is a coverage ratio that compares funds from operations to total debt and is a key ratio analyzed by the credit rating agencies in determining Exelon's credit rating. An investment grade rating is critical as it increases the ability to participate in commercial business opportunities, lowers collateral requirements, creates reliable and cost-efficient access to capital markets and increases business and financial flexibility. The ratio is calculated following S&P's current methodology. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is GAAP Cash Flow from Operations and the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Debt is Long-Term Debt plus Short-Term Borrowings. Management uses FFO/Debt to evaluate financial risk by measuring the company's ability to service debt using cash from operations. We believe the measure enhances an investor's overall understanding of the creditworthiness of Exelon's operating companies.
Due to the forward-looking nature of some forecasted non-GAAP measures, information to reconcile the forecasted adjusted (non-GAAP) measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure may not be currently available; therefore, management is unable to reconcile these measures.

Exelon Corporation Categorical Standards of Independence
In accordance with The Exelon Corporation Independence Standards for Directors, the Board has determined that the following categories of relationships do not affect an Exelon director's independence unless determined to affect a director's independence by reason of the independence standards set forth in Exelon's Corporate Governance Principles. The categorical standards are intended to assist the directors with independence determinations in connection with relationships not specifically covered by the independence standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Principles. The Board may determine that other relationships do not affect independence.
Immaterial position and ownership interest: The relationship arises solely from (1) such director's (or an immediate family member's) position as a director, trustee, advisory board member, or similar position with another company or organization; (2) such director's (or an immediate family member's) direct or indirect ownership of a 10% or less equity interest in another company or organization; or (3) a combination of the relationships described in clauses (1) and (2).
Immaterial business relationships: A director's (or an immediate family member's) relationship with another company that participates in a transaction with the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries where: the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bid or are competitive with current prices generally available to the public for similar goods and services; the transaction involves the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; the transaction involves services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services, or commercial banking services provided on arm's length terms and in the ordinary course of business; the provider of goods or services in a transaction is determined by the purchaser to be the only practical source to obtain the goods or services; or the interest arises solely from direct or indirect ownership of debt or equity securities of the Company or its subsidiaries where all holders of the same class of securities have the same rights and receive the same benefits on a pro rata basis.
Immaterial transactions: A director's (or an immediate family member's) relationship with another company that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in the last fiscal year, does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues for such year.
Immaterial indebtedness: A director's relationship as an executive officer, or where any member of his or her immediate family is an executive officer, of any other company which is indebted to the Company, or to which the Company is indebted, in each case excluding normal trade debt, and the total principal amount of such indebtedness is less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the total consolidated assets of such other company.
Immaterial investment: A director's (or an immediate family member's) relationship with another company (1) in which Exelon or any of its consolidated subsidiaries (including any benefit plan or arrangement sponsored by Exelon or its consolidated subsidiaries), or any nuclear decommissioning trust or other segregated investment fund maintained by Exelon or its subsidiaries makes investments or places funds for investment management or (2) which underwrites or invests in securities issued by Exelon or any of its consolidated subsidiaries, all in the ordinary course of such other company's business on terms and under circumstances similar to those available to or from entities unaffiliated with such director.
Immaterial non-profit relationships: A director's relationship as a current employee or where any member of his or her immediate family serves as executive officer of a charitable or educational organization which receives contributions from the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries in its most recent fiscal year of less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of that organization's consolidated gross revenues in that year. In any other circumstances, a director's relationship with a charity or educational organization to which the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries makes contributions where the aggregate contributions made by the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries to that organization in its most recent fiscal year were less than the greater of $1 million or 5% of that organization's consolidated gross receipts for that year.
