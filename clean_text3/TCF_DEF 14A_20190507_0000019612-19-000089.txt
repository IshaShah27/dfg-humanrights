1. to elect 13 directors;  
2. to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019;  
3. to conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
4. to approve the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019. 
[END TABLE]
We will also conduct any other business that properly comes before the meeting or at any adjournment of the meeting. 
You are receiving this notice and can vote at the meeting and any adjournment of the meeting if you were a shareholder of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2019. The enclosed proxy statement and proxy are first being sent to our shareholders on approximately March 26, 2019. A copy of our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 is enclosed with this notice. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to be Held on May 7, 2019. Again this year, we are taking advantage of the rules of the SEC that allow us to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet. We are mailing to our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, rather than mailing a full paper set of the materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials on the Internet, as well as instructions on obtaining a paper or email copy of the proxy materials. This process will reduce our costs to print and distribute our proxy materials. 
We urge you to please vote your shares now whether or not you plan to attend the meeting.  Voting by the Internet or telephone is fast and convenient, and your vote is immediately confirmed and tabulated. If you request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, you may also vote by completing, signing, dating and returning the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed return envelope furnished for that purpose. By using the Internet or voting by telephone, you help us reduce postage and proxy tabulation costs. 
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

PROXY STATEMENT 
dated March 26, 2019 
For the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 7, 2019 
Introduction 
Use of Terms 
In this proxy statement, "we," "us," "our," "Chemical," or the "Corporation" refer to Chemical Financial Corporation, the "Bank" refers to Chemical Bank, and "you" and "your" refer to each shareholder of Chemical Financial Corporation. 
Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and Our 2019 Annual Meeting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q. Why am I receiving these materials?  
A. Our board of directors is providing these proxy materials to you in connection with its solicitation of proxies for use at the Chemical Financial Corporation 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. The meeting will take place on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 3:30 p.m. local time, at Cobo Center, 1 Washington Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan. You are invited to attend the meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.  
Q. What proposals will be voted on at the annual meeting?  
A. The following proposals are scheduled to be voted on at the annual meeting:  
• Proposal 1 – to elect 13 directors; 
• Proposal 2 – to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019;  
• Proposal 3 – to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
• Proposal 4 – to approve the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, any other business that properly comes before the meeting will be considered and voted on. As of the date of this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other matters to be considered and voted on at the meeting. If any other matters are presented, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy will have discretionary authority to vote for you on those matters.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. What information is contained in these materials?  
A. The information included in this proxy statement discusses the proposals to be voted on at the meeting, the voting process, the compensation of our directors and named executive officers, and certain other required information. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials to be sent to you by mail, your proxy, which you may use to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement, is also enclosed.  
Q. How does the Chemical board of directors recommend that I vote?  
A. Your board of directors recommends that you vote: 
• FOR each nominee to the board of directors; 
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019;  
• FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers; and  
• FOR the approval of the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019. 
Q. Who may vote?  
A. You may vote at the annual meeting if you were a shareholder of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 12, 2019. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share of our common stock on each matter presented for a  
[END TABLE]
 shareholder vote at the meeting. As of the March 12, 2019 record date, there were 71,538,472 shares of Chemical common stock issued and outstanding. 
We anticipate that the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will first be sent to shareholders on or about March 26, 2019. The proxy statement and the form of proxy relating to the annual meeting are first being made available to shareholders on or about March 26, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials?  
A.    Again this year, pursuant to the SEC "Notice and Access" rules, we are furnishing our proxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet instead of mailing each of our shareholders paper copies of those materials. As a result, we will send our shareholders by mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice, containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and how to vote. The Notice is not a ballot or proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares of common stock. The Notice also tells you how to access your proxy card to vote on the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed or email copy of the proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice. You will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the Notice.  
[END TABLE]
       If you own shares of common stock in more than one account – for example, in a joint account with your spouse and in your individual brokerage account – you may have received more than one Notice. To vote all of your shares of common stock, please follow each of the separate proxy voting instructions that you received for your shares of common stock held in each of your different accounts. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. What is the quorum requirement for the annual meeting? 
A. To conduct business at the annual meeting, a quorum of shareholders must be present. The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of the holders of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary for a quorum. To determine whether a quorum is present, we will include shares that are present or represented by proxy, including abstentions and shares represented by a broker non-vote on any matter. 
Q. What are broker non-votes? 
A. Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker in street name for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because the broker has not received timely voting instructions from the beneficial owner and the broker lacks discretionary voting power to vote those shares. In these cases, the broker can register your shares as being present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.     
Q. Does my broker have discretionary authority to vote my shares? 
A. If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions, then your broker only has discretionary authority to vote your shares on certain "routine" matters. We expect that Proposal 2 will be considered a routine matter and your broker will have discretionary authority to vote your shares on such proposal. Proposals 1, 3 and 4 are not considered routine matters and your broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on these matters. It is important that you promptly provide your broker with voting instructions if you want your shares voted on Proposals 1, 3 and 4. 
Q. How do I vote if I hold my shares directly?  
A. If you hold shares in your own name, you may vote by selecting any of the following options:  
• Internet Voting.    You may vote via the Internet 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by visiting www.proxypush.com/CHFC. Follow the steps outlined on the secure website. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Telephone Voting.    You may vote via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by dialing the toll-free number on the instructions included on your proxy and listening for further directions. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail.  If you request printed copies of the proxy materials to be sent to you by mail, you can complete the proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided.   
[END TABLE]
Shares represented by signed proxies will be voted as instructed. If you sign the proxy but do not mark your vote, your shares will be voted as the directors have recommended.  If you acquired your shares through the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan or if you hold your shares in street name, see the instructions below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. How do I vote my shares acquired through the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan (Computershare CIP)?  
A.  If you are enrolled in our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan (Computershare CIP), the enclosed proxy covers: (1) all shares of our common stock owned of record by you at the record date, and (2) all shares of our common stock held by you in the Computershare CIP at that time. Computershare, as agent under the Computershare CIP, will vote any common stock held by it under the Computershare CIP in accordance with your written direction as indicated on the proxy. All such shares will be voted the way you direct. If no specific instruction is given on a returned proxy, Computershare will vote as recommended by the board of directors.  
Q. How do I vote if I hold my shares in "street name"?  
A. If you hold your shares in "street name," which means that your shares are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee (which we collectively refer to as your "broker"), your broker must vote your street name shares in the manner you direct if you provide your broker with proper and timely voting instructions. Please use the voting forms and instructions provided by your broker or its agent. These forms and instructions typically permit you to give voting instructions by telephone or the Internet if you wish. If you are a street name holder and want to change your vote, you must contact your broker. Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name in person at the annual meeting unless you request and receive a valid proxy from your broker.  
Q. Can I change my mind after I return my proxy?  
A. Yes.  If you are a shareholder of record (i.e., you hold your shares directly instead of through a brokerage account) and you change your mind after you return your proxy or you vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone, you retain the power to revoke your proxy or change your vote. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote before it is voted by:   
• timely delivering written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, William C. Collins, at 235 E. Main Street, Midland, Michigan 48640;  
• timely delivering a new valid proxy bearing a later date either by mail, electronic vote over the Internet or by telephone; or  
• attending the meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a brokerage account, you must contact your brokerage firm to revoke your proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. What vote is necessary to approve the proposals?  
A. Proposal 1: Election of Directors.   
• Standard.  Assuming a quorum is present, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the 13 nominees who receive the largest number of "FOR" votes cast will be elected as directors.  In the event that a nominee currently serving as a director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election, such nominee must promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee must promptly consider the resignation and recommend to the board of directors whether to accept or reject the resignation. The board of directors then must act on the committee's recommendation and determine whether to accept or reject the resignation. Shareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.  
• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes.  If you fail to vote, mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to Proposal 1, you will be deemed not to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have no effect on the proposal. 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 2: Ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting for 2019.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Standard.  Assuming a quorum is present, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes.  If you fail to vote, mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to Proposal 2, you will be deemed not to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have no effect on the proposal. 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 3: Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Standard.  Assuming a quorum is present, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes.  If you fail to vote, mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to Proposal 3, you will be deemed not to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have no effect on the proposal. 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 4: Approval of the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Standard.  Assuming a quorum is present, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes.  If you fail to vote, mark "ABSTAIN" on your proxy card, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to Proposal 4, you will be deemed not to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have no effect on the proposal. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. May the annual meeting be adjourned?  
A. Yes. Under our bylaws, the Chair of the board or, in his absence the Chief Executive Officer or other presiding officer may, in his or her discretion, adjourn or postpone a meeting of shareholders regardless of whether a quorum is present.  In addition, the shareholders present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting regardless of whether a quorum is present. Shares represented by proxy may be voted at the discretion of the proxy holder on a proposal to adjourn the meeting. 
Q. What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?  
A. It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all of your shares.  
Q. Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting?  
A. We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within four business days of the date of the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
 Proposal 1 
Election of 13 Directors 
Each director listed below has been nominated by our board of directors, following review and recommendation by our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, to serve a one-year term expiring at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders or until that person's successor is duly elected and qualified:
James R. Fitterling
Ronald A. Klein
Richard M. Lievense
Barbara J. Mahone
 Barbara L. McQuade
John E. Pelizzari
David T. Provost 
Thomas C. Shafer 
Larry D. Stauffer
Jeffrey L. Tate
Gary Torgow
Arthur A. Weiss 
Franklin C. Wheatlake 
Each proposed nominee currently serves as a director of Chemical Financial Corporation and Chemical Bank for a term that will expire at this year's annual meeting or until that person's successor is duly elected and qualified. Each nominee has agreed to serve as a director if elected. If a nominee is unable to serve or is otherwise unavailable for election, which we do not anticipate, the incumbent board of directors may or may not select a substitute nominee. If a substitute nominee is selected, your proxy will be voted for the person selected. If a substitute nominee is not selected, your proxy will be voted for the election of the remaining nominees. No proxy will be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named above.
Biographical information concerning each of our director nominees appears below under the heading "Board of Directors." Each of the current directors and nominees for director other than David T. Provost, Thomas C. Shafer, Gary Torgow and Richard M. Lievense qualified as independent directors as defined by NASDAQ listing rules, including such definitions applicable to each committee of the board of directors upon which he or she serves or served. 
Your Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommends that you vote FOR the election of all nominees as directors.  Proposal 2
Ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 
The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2019 and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, and to perform such other appropriate audit-related accounting, tax compliance or other tax services as may be approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee and the board of directors propose and recommend that shareholders ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
More information concerning our relationship with KPMG LLP appears below under the subheading "Board Committees–Audit Committee" and the headings "Audit Committee Report" and "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm." 
If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will consider a change of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year. 
Your Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 2.
Proposal 3 
Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) requires, among other things, that we hold a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in this proxy statement. 
This proposal (sometimes referred to as a Say-on-Pay proposal) gives you, as a shareholder, the opportunity to approve or not approve our executive compensation through the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion is hereby approved." 
We believe that our executive compensation programs and policies appropriately align named executive officers' incentives with shareholder interests and are designed to attract and retain high quality executive talent. We believe that our executive compensation programs and policies are and have been competitive within the industry and in comparison with the compensation programs and policies of competitors in the markets that we serve. We also believe that both Chemical and our shareholders benefit from responsive corporate governance policies and dialogue.
This vote is advisory, which means that it is not binding on us or the board of directors, and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the board of directors or creating an additional fiduciary duty of the board of directors. However, the Compensation and Pension Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
Our current policy is to provide shareholders with an opportunity to approve executive compensation each year at the annual meeting of shareholders. The next such vote is scheduled to occur at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders.
Your Board of Directors and the Compensation and Pension Committee recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 3. 
Proposal 4
Approval of the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019
The purpose of the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019 (the "2019 Stock Plan") is to advance our long-term interests by aligning the interests of our officers, directors and key employees with those of our shareholders through equity-based awards. Our board of directors also believes that equity-based awards are necessary to attract, retain and motivate officers, directors and key employees of exceptional abilities, and to recognize the significant contributions these individuals have made to our long-term performance and growth.  Under the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2017 (the "2017 Stock Plan"), 1,301,285 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2018. Because there are a limited number of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Stock Plan, our board of directors believes that it is advisable to implement the 2019 Stock Plan, which will make additional shares available for restricted stock units (including both performance-based restricted stock units and time-vesting restricted stock units), stock options and other equity-based awards.  The 2019 Stock Plan, if approved, will replace the 2017 Stock Plan and no new awards will be granted under the 2017 Stock Plan.  However, any awards outstanding under the 2017 Stock Plan, and any prior plan, will continue to be outstanding and governed by the provisions of the applicable plans.  
If the 2019 Stock Plan is not approved by our shareholders, it will not be adopted and we will continue to operate under the 2017 Stock Plan until it expires.  In the event the 2019 Stock Plan is not approved, our flexibility may be limited with respect to our ability to provide incentives and reward employees and directors, to attract and retain such persons on a competitive basis and to align the interests of such persons with ours. 
On the approval and recommendation of our Compensation and Pension Committee (the "Compensation Committee"), the board of directors has adopted and approved the 2019 Stock Plan, subject to shareholder approval.  The board of directors believes that the design of the 2019 Stock Plan and the number of shares to be authorized for issuance under the plan are consistent with the interests of shareholders and good corporate governance practices. In adopting and approving the 2019 Stock Plan, the board of directors was mindful of investor considerations relating to the plan, including the following:
Important Plan Features
The total number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan will be 2,400,000. The 2019 Stock Plan reflects current practices in equity incentive plans that we consider best practices, such as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Share Recycling. Shares subject to equity-based awards that are cancelled, surrendered, modified, or exchanged for substitute equity-based awards, or that forfeit, expire or terminate prior to exercise or vesting in full and shares that are surrendered to us in connection with the exercise or vesting of equity-based awards, whether previously owned or otherwise subject to such equity-based awards, may not be reissued as new equity-based awards under the plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Dividends on Unvested Equity Awards. Holders of unvested equity-based awards will not be entitled to dividend rights with respect to the shares of common stock constituting or subject to such unvested equity-based awards, provided that dividends otherwise payable with respect to such shares of common stock may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, accrue and become payable upon vesting of the equity-based awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimum Vesting Period of One Year.  At least 95% of all equity-based awards granted under the plan must have a minimum vesting period of at least one year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Repricing. Equity-based awards may not be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, or modified without shareholder approval if such repricing, replacement, regrant or modification would reduce the exercise price of such equity-based awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Double-Trigger Acceleration of Vesting of Equity Awards on a Change in Control. Under the plan, unless otherwise stated in any award agreement or separate agreement with the participant, on a change in control of Chemical, the vesting of unvested equity awards would only accelerate on a qualifying termination of employment.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clawback Policy Implementation. All awards under the plan will be subject to any applicable law respecting recapture of compensation and Chemical's clawback policy for the recoupment of incentive compensation, as it may be amended from time to time.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Oversight. The plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee, which is a committee of independent board members. 
[END TABLE]
Grant Practices
Burn rate, which is a measure of share utilization rate in equity compensation plans, is an important factor for investors concerned about shareholder dilution. Burn rate is defined as the gross number of equity-based awards granted during a calendar year divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. We have counted full-value awards, which do not include stock options, as 3.0 shares of common stock when calculating the burn rate. Our board of directors believes that our current three-year average burn rate for the period ended December 31, 2018 of 1.44% compares favorably to the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended burn rate benchmark of 2.81% for Russell 3000 (excluding S&P 500)  banking institutions for meetings occurring on or after February 1, 2019, as set forth in the Appendix to the ISS report titled "U.S. Equity Compensation Plans Frequently Asked Questions" updated December 19, 2018.

I. Adjusted 3-Year Burn Rate (Average of 2016-2018)     1.44% 
[END TABLE]
Our board of directors does not anticipate a significant increase in our average burn rate and estimates that the additional 2,400,000 shares to be authorized for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan will be sufficient for four to five years as a stand-alone company. However, assuming completion of our recently announced merger with TCF Financial Corporation, which we expect to close in the third or early fourth quarter of 2019 (subject to required shareholder and regulatory approvals), we expect the increase in our size and number of employees to cause the shares to be authorized for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan to be sufficient for a substantially shorter period of time.
The performance-based restricted stock units granted in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are earned from 0% to 150% of the number of units originally granted depending on satisfaction of the established performance conditions, and vest upon satisfaction of the service requirement at the end of the restricted period. Time-vesting restricted stock units granted in 2016 and 2017 generally cliff vest five years after the grant date. Time-vesting restricted stock units granted in 2018 and 2019 generally vest in equal annual installments on each anniversary of the grant date over a five year period. Stock options granted in 2016 and 2017 vest in equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date over a five year period.
60% of the equity-based compensation awarded to our Chief Executive Officer in 2018 consisted of performance-based restricted stock units with a three-year performance period and 40% consisted of time-vesting restricted stock units, which vest in equal annual installments on each anniversary of the grant date over a five year period.

Overhang is a commonly used measure to assess the dilutive impact of equity programs such as the 2019 Stock Plan. Overhang shows how much existing shareholder ownership would be diluted if all outstanding equity-based awards plus all remaining shares available for equity-based awards were introduced into the market. Overhang is equal to the number of equity-award shares currently outstanding plus the number of equity-award shares available to be granted, divided by the total diluted shares of common stock outstanding at the end of the year. Our board of directors believes that an overhang of less than 15% is generally considered by investors to not raise questions of excessive dilution. The 2,400,000 shares subject to the 2019 Stock Plan would bring our aggregate overhang to 5.80%. The table below provides updated overhang data as of March 12, 2019:

Purposes of 2019 Stock Plan
Our board of directors believes that our long-term interests are advanced by aligning the interests of our officers, directors and key employees with those of our shareholders through equity-based awards. Our board of directors also believes that equity-based awards are necessary to attract, retain and motivate officers, directors and key employees of exceptional abilities, and to recognize the significant contributions these individuals have made to our long-term performance and growth. 
We intend to use the 2019 Stock Plan to grant equity-based awards that are predominantly performance-based restricted stock units and time-vesting restricted stock units. Restricted stock, stock options, stock awards and other awards based on or related to shares of our common stock may also be awarded under the 2019 Stock Plan. By combining in a single plan many types of incentives commonly used in long-term incentive compensation programs, the 2019 Stock Plan is intended to provide us with a great deal of flexibility in designing specific long-term incentives to best promote the objectives of the 2019 Stock Plan and in turn promote the interests of our shareholders.
If the 2019 Stock Plan is approved by the shareholders, then equity-based awards could be granted to eligible participants under the 2019 Stock Plan and no additional awards will be made under the 2017 Stock Plan. The 2019 Stock Plan is intended to supplement and continue the equity-based compensation policies and practices that we have used for many years. Our board of directors adopted and approved the 2019 Stock Plan on March 19, 2019. If the shareholders approve the 2019 Stock Plan on May 7, 2019, it will become effective on that date. Equity-based awards would be granted under the 2019 Stock Plan to participants for no cash consideration or for such minimum consideration as determined by the Compensation Committee. If the 2019 Stock Plan is approved, no equity-based awards would be granted under the plan on a date that is more than ten years after the plan's effective date.  The 2019 Stock Plan would not be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and would not be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). If the 2019 Stock Plan is not approved by the shareholders, then no equity-based awards will be granted under the 2019 Stock Plan for any employee or director The following is a summary of the material features of the 2019 Stock Plan; however, it is not complete and, therefore, you should not rely solely on it for a detailed description of every aspect of the 2019 Stock Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the 2019 Stock Plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. Included in the summary is information regarding the effect of U.S. federal tax laws upon participants and us. This information is not a complete summary of such tax laws and does not discuss the income tax laws of any state in which a participant may reside, and is subject to change. Participants in the 2019 Stock Plan should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of participating in and receiving equity-based awards under the 2019 Stock Plan.
Authorized Shares
Subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments, 2,400,000 shares of our common stock, $1.00 par value per share, would be available for equity-based awards under the 2019 Stock Plan. Shares of common stock authorized under the 2019 Stock Plan could be either authorized but unissued shares, shares issued and repurchased by us (including shares purchased on the open market) or shares issued and otherwise reacquired by us. Shares subject to equity-based awards that are canceled, surrendered, modified, or exchanged for substitute equity-based awards, or that forfeit, expire or terminate prior to exercise or vesting in full, and shares that are surrendered to us in connection with the exercise or vesting of equity-based awards, whether previously owned or otherwise subject to such equity-based awards, may not be reissued as new equity-based awards under the 2019 Stock Plan. The 2019 Stock Plan would not allow any participant to receive, in any calendar year, equity-based awards issued under the 2019 Stock Plan with respect to more than 25% of the total number of shares available under the 2019 Stock Plan. Upon certain changes in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding (e.g., stock split, recapitalization) or the occurrence of certain corporate events (e.g., merger, stock dividend), the Compensation Committee could adjust the outstanding equity-based awards and the number of shares available for equity-based awards appropriately. If the shareholders approve the 2019 Stock Plan, unless the 2019 Stock Plan is terminated earlier by our board of directors, equity-based awards could be granted at any time before May 7, 2029, when the 2019 Stock Plan will terminate according to its terms.
Eligible Participants
Approximately 200 officers and key employees of Chemical and our subsidiaries may receive equity-based awards under the 2019 Stock Plan. Officers, directors, and key employees of Chemical and our subsidiaries may be considered to have an interest in the 2019 Stock Plan because they may in the future receive equity-based awards under it.
New Plan Benefits
No equity-based awards have been granted or received under the 2019 Stock Plan through the date of this Proxy Statement. Because benefits under the 2019 Stock Plan will depend on the Compensation Committee's actions and the fair market value of our common stock at various future dates, the benefits payable under the 2019 Stock Plan and the benefits that would have been payable had the 2019 Stock Plan been in effect during the most recent fiscal year are not determinable.
Administration of the 2019 Stock Plan
The 2019 Stock Plan would be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee would be authorized and empowered to do all things that it determined to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the administration of the 2019 Stock Plan. The Compensation Committee would determine, subject to the terms of the 2019 Stock Plan, the persons to receive equity-based awards, the nature and amount of equity-based awards to be granted to each person (subject to the limits specified in the 2019 Stock Plan), the time of each grant, the terms and duration of each grant, and all other determinations necessary or advisable for administration of the 2019 Stock Plan.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units, Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units, and Restricted Stock
The 2019 Stock Plan would also permit the Compensation Committee to award restricted stock units (including both performance-based restricted stock units and time-vesting restricted stock units) and restricted stock, subject to the terms and conditions set by the Compensation Committee that are consistent with the 2019 Stock Plan. Restricted stock units are equity-based awards denominated in units of our common stock under which the issuance of shares of our common stock is subject to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate (including achievement of performance goals established by the committee and/or continued employment or service as a director). For purposes of determining the number of shares available under the 2019 Stock Plan, each restricted stock unit would count as the maximum number of shares of our common stock subject to the restricted stock unit. Unless determined otherwise by the Compensation Committee, each earned restricted stock unit would be equal to one share of our common stock and would entitle a participant to either shares of our common stock or an amount of cash determined with reference to the value of shares of our common stock. Shares of restricted stock are shares of our common stock, the retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject, for specified periods of time, to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate (including achievement of performance goals established by the committee and/or continued employment or service as a director). 
The Compensation Committee would establish the terms of individual awards of restricted stock units and restricted stock in award agreements. Restricted stock units and restricted stock granted to a participant would "vest" (i.e., the restrictions on them would lapse) in the manner and at the times that the Compensation Committee determines. The Compensation Committee would be permitted to vary the terms, conditions and restrictions among participants and among grants to the same participant, including the terms and conditions described below.
If a director's service ceases or a participant's employment is terminated during the restricted period (i.e., the period of time during which restricted stock units or restricted stock are subject to vesting or performance restrictions) for any reason other than death, disability, termination without cause or retirement, each unvested restricted stock unit and restricted stock award of the participant would automatically be forfeited and, in the case of restricted stock, returned to us. 
If a director's service ceases or a participant's employment is terminated during the restricted period because of death, disability or termination without cause, then, unless otherwise specified in an applicable award agreement or controlling agreement with respect to the participant, the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units would lapse and would vest on a prorated basis and be convertible into a number of shares of our common stock equal to (a) the number of the participant's unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units as of the effective date of the termination, multiplied by (b) the quotient of (x) the number of full months that have elapsed since the later of the date of grant or the most recent annual vesting date and the effective date of participant's termination or cessation of service and (y) the total number of full months remaining in the vesting period since the later of the date of grant or the most recent annual vesting date.  We currently anticipate that award agreements for our executives will provide for full vesting upon a termination of employment or cessation of service because of death, disability or termination without cause.  For restricted stock or restricted stock units that are subject to attainment of performance goals, the number of the participant's unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units that are subject to proration, or full vesting (if applicable), as of the effective date of his or her termination shall be the target (100%) number of restricted stock or restricted stock units set forth in the applicable equity-based award agreement. All of the unvested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock would be forfeited and, in the case of restricted stock, returned to us; however, the Compensation Committee could, either before or after a participant dies or becomes disabled, waive the vesting or performance restrictions remaining on any or all of his or her remaining restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock.
If a participant who is a director ceases providing services as a director due to retirement during the restricted period, then the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of restricted stock shall terminate automatically in full upon retirement. If a participant's employment is terminated during the restricted period due to the participant's retirement and the participant fails to provide at least one year's notice of retirement to us, each unvested restricted stock unit and share of restricted stock of the participant would automatically be forfeited and, in the case of restricted stock, returned to us. If the participant's employment is terminated during the restricted period due to the participant's retirement upon not less than one year's notice of retirement to us, then the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units would lapse and would vest on a prorated basis, or fully vest (if applicable), and be convertible into a number of shares of our common stock in the manner applicable to the termination of employment because of death, disability, or termination without cause. All of the remaining performance-based restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock would be forfeited and, in the case of restricted stock, returned to us; however, the Compensation Committee could, either before or after a participant retires, waive the vesting or performance restrictions remaining on any or all of his or her remaining restricted stock performance units or shares of restricted stock.
Federal Tax Consequences of Restricted Stock, Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units and Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units
Generally, under current federal income tax laws, a participant would not recognize income upon the award of restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock units or time-vesting restricted stock units. However, a participant would be required to recognize compensation income at the time the award vests (when the restrictions lapse) equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock at vesting and the amount paid for the stock (if any). At the time the participant recognizes compensation income, we would be entitled to a corresponding deduction for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent that the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. If restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock units or time-vesting restricted stock units are forfeited by a participant, the participant would not recognize income with respect to the forfeited award and we would not receive a corresponding deduction for federal income tax purposes. 
A participant could, within 30 days after the date of an award of restricted stock (but not an award of restricted stock units), elect to report compensation income for the tax year in which the restricted stock is awarded. If the participant makes this election, the amount of compensation income would be equal to the difference between the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time  of the award and the amount paid for the stock (if any). Any later appreciation in the value of the restricted stock would be treated as capital gain and recognized only upon the sale of the shares subject to the award of restricted stock. If, however, restricted stock is forfeited after the participant makes such an election, the participant would not be allowed any deduction for the amount that he or she earlier reported as income. Upon the sale of shares subject to the restricted stock award, a participant would recognize capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the sale price and the participant's basis in the stock.
Stock Options
The 2019 Stock Plan would permit us to grant to participants options to purchase shares of our common stock at stated prices for specific periods of time. For purposes of determining the number of shares available under the 2019 Stock Plan, each stock option would count as the number of shares of common stock subject to the stock option. Stock options that could be granted under the 2019 Stock Plan may only be nonqualified stock options and may not qualify as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The Compensation Committee would establish the terms of individual stock option grants in stock option agreements. These documents would contain terms, conditions and restrictions that the committee determines to be appropriate. These restrictions could include vesting requirements to encourage long-term ownership of shares. The Compensation Committee would be permitted to vary the terms, conditions and restrictions among participants and among grants to the same participant.
The exercise price of a stock option would be determined by the Compensation Committee, but must be at least 100% of the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. No stock option could be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation or modified without shareholder approval if the effect of such repricing, replacement, regrant or modification would be to reduce the exercise price of such stock options to the same participants.
When exercising all or a portion of a stock option, a participant may pay the exercise price with cash or, if permitted by the Compensation Committee, shares of our common stock. The Compensation Committee could also authorize payment of all or a portion of the exercise price in the form of a promissory note or installment payments, except as limited by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other laws, rules or regulations. Any promissory note or installment payments must be with full recourse and at the market rate of interest. Our board of directors may restrict or suspend the power of the Compensation Committee to permit such loans, however, and could require that adequate security be provided. In addition, the Compensation Committee allows broker-assisted cashless exercises of stock options. 
Although the term of each stock option would be determined by the Compensation Committee, no stock option would be exercisable under the 2019 Stock Plan more than 10 years and one day after the date it was granted. Stock options generally would be exercisable for limited periods of time if an option holder dies, becomes disabled, retires, is terminated without cause, or voluntarily leaves his or her employment or service to the extent that such options were exercisable on the date of the option holder's death, disability, or termination of employment. If an option holder is terminated for cause, the option holder would forfeit all rights to exercise any outstanding stock options. 
Restrictions on Transfer
Without Compensation Committee consent or permission, a participant cannot sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of an equity-based award granted under the 2019 Stock Plan other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. All rights with respect to equity-based awards would only be exercisable during a participant's lifetime by the participant or his or her guardian or legal representative. The Compensation Committee could impose additional restrictions on equity-based awards. 
Federal Tax Consequences of Stock Options
The 2019 Stock Plan only provides for awards of nonqualified stock options – those options that do not meet the Internal Revenue Code's definition of an incentive stock option. Under current federal income tax laws, an option holder would not recognize any income and we would not receive a deduction for federal income tax purposes when a nonqualified stock option is granted or vests. If a nonqualified stock option is exercised, the option holder would recognize compensation income equal to the difference between the exercise price paid and the market value of the stock acquired upon exercise (on the date of exercise). We would then receive a corresponding deduction for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent that the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. The option holder's tax basis in the shares acquired would be the exercise price paid plus the amount of compensation income recognized. Sale of the stock after exercise would result in recognition of short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss).
Other Stock-Based Awards
The 2019 Stock Plan would also permit the Compensation Committee to grant a participant one or more types of awards in the form of our common stock or based on, or related to, shares of our common stock, other than the types described above. The  Compensation Committee could make stock awards for any amount of consideration, or no consideration, as the Compensation Committee determines. Any such awards would be subject to terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, as set forth in the respective award agreements and as permitted under the 2019 Stock Plan. Stock award recipients would generally have all voting, liquidation and other rights with respect to awarded shares of our common stock upon becoming the holder of record of the common stock granted pursuant to the award, subject to the restrictions regarding payment of dividends as set forth below. However, the Compensation Committee could impose restrictions on the assignment or transfer of common stock awarded under the 2019 Stock Plan.
Federal Tax Consequences of Other Stock-Based Awards
The recipient of a stock award generally would recognize compensation income equal to the difference between the fair market value of the stock when it is awarded and the amount paid for the stock (if any). The recipient's tax basis in the stock would equal the amount of compensation income recognized on the award plus the amount paid by the recipient for the stock (if any). We would be entitled to a corresponding deduction for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of compensation income recognized by the recipient, except to the extent that the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. Upon a subsequent sale of the stock, the recipient would recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and his or her basis in the stock. Different rules may apply where the stock is transferred subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture."
Dividends
Holders of unvested equity-based awards will not be entitled to dividend rights with respect to the shares of our common stock constituting or subject to such unvested equity-based awards; provided, however, that dividends otherwise payable with respect to such shares of our common stock may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, accrue and become payable upon vesting of the equity-based awards.
Effects of a Change in Control of Chemical 
Unless otherwise stated in any award agreement or separate agreement with the participant under the 2019 Stock Plan, upon the occurrence of a change in control of Chemical (as defined in the 2019 Stock Plan), the vesting of unvested equity awards would accelerate only upon a qualifying termination of employment and, in the case of performance-based equity awards, would be subject to vesting at the greater of (a) target performance and (b) actual performance, measured through the latest practicable date before the effective date of the change in control, subject to forfeiture based on the participant's continued service through the restricted period.  In addition, absent any qualifying termination of employment, unvested equity awards (including those that are cashed out in connection with the change in control) would remain subject to their original vesting schedules.
Tax Withholding
If equity-based awards are made under the 2019 Stock Plan, we could withhold from any cash otherwise payable to a participant or require a participant to remit to us amounts necessary to satisfy applicable withholding and employment-related taxes. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, tax withholding obligations could also be satisfied by withholding our common stock to be received upon exercise or vesting of an equity-based award or by delivering to us previously owned shares of our common stock. We may reasonably delay the issuance or delivery of shares of our common stock pursuant to an equity-based award as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and other administrative matters.
Termination and Amendment of the 2019 Stock Plan or Awards
Our board of directors could terminate the 2019 Stock Plan at any time and could from time to time amend the 2019 Stock Plan, as it considers proper and in our best interests, provided that no such amendment could be made (except adjustments expressly permitted by the 2019 Stock Plan) without the approval of our shareholders if such amendment would (i) reduce the exercise price of a stock option below the market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, (ii) reduce the exercise price of outstanding stock options, (iii) increase the individual annual maximum award limit, or (iv) otherwise amend the 2019 Stock Plan in any manner requiring shareholder approval by law or under NASDAQ listing requirements or rules. In addition, no amendment to the 2019 Stock Plan or to a previously granted equity-based award could impair the rights of a holder of any outstanding equity-based award without the consent of the participant, except in certain circumstances in which such amendment is necessary to satisfy a law or regulation or to meet the requirements of or avoid adverse tax or financial accounting consequences under any tax or accounting standard, law or regulation.
Subject to certain limitations, the Compensation Committee could amend or modify the terms of any outstanding equity-based award in any manner not prohibited by the 2019 Stock Plan. However, equity-based awards issued under the 2019 Stock Plan could not be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation or modified without shareholder approval if the effect would be  to reduce the exercise price of such equity-based awards to the same participants. We could also suspend a participant's rights under the 2019 Stock Plan for a period of up to 60 days while a participant's termination for cause is considered.
Performance-based Awards
The 2019 Stock Plan is intended to provide for the ability to grant equity-based awards that are performance-based compensation. Performance-based compensation means the vesting or payment of such equity-based award must be contingent upon the achievement of one or more performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The performance goals for equity-based awards must meet certain other criteria as well to qualify as performance-based compensation, including (i) the performance goals must be established in writing by the Compensation Committee during the first 90 days of the applicable performance period and before 25% of the performance period has elapsed, (ii) the satisfaction of the performance goals must be substantially uncertain when established by the committee for the performance period, and (iii) the performance goals must be based solely upon objective criteria from which an independent third party with knowledge of the facts could determine whether the performance goal or set of goals is satisfied and from that determination could calculate the performance-based compensation to be paid.
Under the 2019 Stock Plan, the performance goals that may be established by the Compensation Committee, with respect to performance-based compensation, include, without limitation, any one or more of the following measurements of performance, either individually or in any combination, applied to either Chemical as a whole or to one of our subsidiaries, either individually or in any combination, and measured against pre-determined levels, the performance of a pre-established peer group or a published or special index: net income; net income per share; return on equity; cash earnings; cash earnings per share, reflecting dilution of the common stock as the committee deems appropriate and, if the committee so determines, net of or including dividends; cash earnings return on equity; operating income; operating income per share; operating income return on equity; return on assets; cash flow; cash flow return on capital; return on capital; productivity ratios; share price (including, without limitation, growth measures or total shareholder return); expense or cost levels; margins; operating efficiency; efficiency ratio; customer satisfaction, satisfaction based on specified objective goals or a Chemical-sponsored customer survey; economic value added measurements; market share or market penetration with respect to specific designated products or services, product or service groups and/or specific geographic areas; reduction of losses, loss ratios, expense ratios or fixed costs; employee turnover; specified objective social goals; noninterest income; interest income; net interest income; deposit growth; and loan growth.
An equity-based award intended to be performance-based compensation could provide that any evaluation of performance could include or exclude certain specific events or their effects that occur during the performance period, including asset write-downs; litigation or claim judgments or settlements; changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; any reorganization and restructuring programs; extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 225-20 and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in our annual report to shareholders for the applicable year; acquisitions, mergers or divestitures (including nonrecurring transaction-related expenses); securities offerings; accounting changes; amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets; discontinued operations; and other special charges or extraordinary items.
No participant in the 2019 Stock Plan may be granted, in any calendar year, awards representing more than 25% of the total number of shares of our common stock available for awards under the 2019 Stock Plan. Performance-based compensation would be paid only after written certification by the Compensation Committee that the applicable performance goals have been satisfied.
Clawback
Equity-based awards under the 2019 Plan would be subject to our clawback policy. For more information, see "Elements of Compensation-Clawback Policy" below.
Registration of Shares
We intend to register shares covered by the 2019 Stock Plan under the Securities Act of 1933 before any performance-based restricted stock units, time-vesting restricted stock units, restricted stock, stock awards or other stock-based or stock-related awards are granted and before any stock options could be exercised.
Required Vote
The 2019 Stock Plan will be approved if a majority of the shares that are voted on this proposal at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposal. Abstentions, broker non-votes and other shares that are not voted on this proposal in person or by proxy will not be included in the vote count.
Your Board of Directors and Compensation Committee recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 4. Board of Directors

Director Independence.   NASDAQ listing rules require a majority of our directors and each member of our Audit, Compensation and Pension, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees to be independent. The Federal Reserve Board's Enhanced Prudential Standards also require the chair of our Risk Management Committee to be independent. Our board of directors has adopted Categorical Director Independence Standards to help fulfill its obligations under NASDAQ rules to determine whether any director has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of the director's independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, which we refer to as a "material relationship."  The categorical standards provide that the following relationships are not material relationships for such purposes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deposit or lending relationships involving a director or his or her immediate family members if the products being offered are being provided in the ordinary course of our business and on substantially the same terms and conditions, including interest rates and collateral (if applicable), as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to us, and, with respect to loans, did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features and such loans are not nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problem loans; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any relationship between us or one of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and another entity, including a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, in which a director, or an immediate family member of a director, is a partner in, a controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of, on the other hand, to which we have made, or from which we have received, payments for property or services, if such payments did not exceed the lesser of $120,000, or 1% of the other entity's consolidated gross revenues in the current fiscal year or any of the past three fiscal years, and excluding (a) payments arising solely from investments in our securities; or (b) payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Contributions made or pledged to any charitable organization, provided, that, neither the director, nor an immediate family member of the director, is currently an executive officer or director of such charitable organization and such contributions did not exceed the greater of $200,000, or 5% of such organization's annual consolidated gross revenues, in the current fiscal year or any of the past three fiscal years, and excluding non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs.

Board and Annual Meeting Attendance 
During 2018, our board of directors held twelve meetings. All of the directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board of directors and meetings of committees on which they served during the year (during the periods that they served). We have a policy that requires all directors and director nominees to attend our annual meeting of shareholders. All of our directors and director nominees attended our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
Director Nominations 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders, directors, officers, third-party search firms and other sources. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will ultimately determine whether a shareholder recommendation will result in a nomination under this process. In considering potential nominees, the committee will review all candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of the recommendation, and will consider the current composition of the board in light of the diverse communities and geographies we serve and the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of the other board members, as well as such other factors as the committee deems appropriate.
Under our bylaws, nominations by shareholders may only be made by sending a notice to our Corporate Secretary that sets forth: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name, age, business address and residence address of each nominee;  
• the principal occupation or employment of each nominee;  
• the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each nominee;  
• a statement that each nominee is willing to be nominated and to serve if elected; and  
• such other information concerning each nominee as would be required under the rules of the SEC to be provided in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of each nominee.  
[END TABLE]
You must send this notice to our Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days before the date of an annual meeting and not more than seven days following the date of notice of a special meeting called for the election of directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate and consider every nominee so proposed by a shareholder and report each such nomination and the committee's recommendation to the full board of directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may also, in its discretion, consider shareholders' informal recommendations of possible nominees. 
In considering possible candidates for election as a director, the committee and the other directors will be guided by applicable rules and regulations, any specific criteria established by the committee and the following criteria: 
Each candidate should have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a demonstrated breadth and depth of management and/or leadership experience, preferably in a senior leadership role (e.g. chief executive officer, managing partner, president);  
• financial literacy or other professional or business experience relevant to an understanding of the Corporation and its business; and  
• a demonstrated ability to think and act independently as well as the ability to work constructively in a collegial environment.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may consider factors such as business and industry experience, public company experience, education, independence, gender, race, national origin, and familiarity with our market areas. The board of directors believes that the Corporation and our shareholders are best served by having a board of directors that brings a diversity of education, experience, skills, and perspective to board meetings. The board of directors welcomes opportunities to include diverse perspectives, talents, ideas and contributions. Consistent with this philosophy, the board of directors may consider factors and characteristics that are pertinent to diversity, such as race and gender, when evaluating nominees to stand for election or re-election to the board. 
Shareholder Communication with the Board 
Shareholders and interested parties may communicate with members of our board of directors by sending correspondence addressed to the board as a whole, a specific committee, or a specific board member c/o William C. Collins, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Chemical Financial Corporation, 235 E. Main Street, Midland, Michigan 48640. All correspondence will be forwarded directly to the applicable members of the board of directors.  Board Leadership Structure 
The board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the board because the board believes it is in our best interests to make that determination based on the membership of the board. The board believes that presently it is in our best interest that the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are separate. The board believes that this separation is presently appropriate as it allows Mr. Provost, as Chief Executive Officer, to focus primarily on leading our day-to-day operations, while Mr. Torgow, the Chair, can focus on leading the board in its consideration of strategic issues and monitoring corporate governance, community relations and shareholder issues. The board has also determined that having Mr. Torgow, who also serves as our Executive Chairman, serve as Chair of the board is in the best interest of our shareholders at this time because this structure makes the best use of Mr. Torgow's extensive experience in board and community relations, particularly in our market areas.
In order to provide for a greater role for the independent directors in our oversight, we have also appointed a Lead Independent Director, Mr. Wheatlake. We also have an independent director serving as the Chair of each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Risk Management Committee.
The duties and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• acting as a liaison and channel for communication between the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Chair and the other directors;  
• providing leadership to ensure the board works cohesively and independently and during times of crisis;  
• advising the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chair as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information from our management to the directors;  
• being available as a resource to consult with the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chair and the other directors on corporate governance practices and policies;  
• together with management where appropriate, considering questions of conflicts of interest of the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chair and the other directors;  
• coordinating the assessment of board committee structure, organization and charters and evaluating the need for change; 
• coordinating, developing the agenda for, and leading executive sessions of the independent directors and communicating the results thereof to the Chief Executive Officer;  
• ensuring the appropriate segregation of duties between the directors and management; and  
• together with the chairperson of the Compensation and Pension Committee, communicating the board's evaluation of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. 
[END TABLE]
Common Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In January 2008, the board of directors established stock ownership guidelines for its directors. Directors, as of April 30, 2008, are required to retain ownership equal to five times the paid annual equity retainer, with a five year timeframe to attain the designated ownership level. Directors appointed to the board after April 2008 are required to retain ownership equal to five times the paid annual retainer (sum of equity and cash retainers) with a five year timeframe to attain the designated ownership level.
In December 2008, the Compensation Committee implemented stock ownership guidelines that set forth the expected investment in shares of our common stock for the named executive officers and other executive and senior officers of the Corporation and Chemical Bank. Expected ownership is expressed as a percentage of base salary, as determined from time to time. The expected ownership for the named executive officers is as follows: Mr. Provost - 500%; Mr. Klaeser - 300%; Mr. Torgow - 300%; Mr. Shafer – 300%; and Mr. Ryan – 300%. Each named executive officer, as well as each other executive officer of the Corporation, is allowed five years from the date the guidelines first become applicable to him or her to achieve the expected stock ownership.
Individuals who acquire shares of common stock under our equity-based incentive plans must hold at least 50% of all net after-tax acquired shares until the earlier of the time such stock ownership guidelines are satisfied or 36 months following acquisition. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
Our anti-hedging policy aligns the interests of our directors and executive officers with our shareholders. The policy prohibits our directors and executive officers from engaging in any transaction which could hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our common stock, including short-selling, put or call options, forward sale or purchase contracts, equity swaps, and exchange funds. Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
We have appointed a Risk Management Committee of the board of directors. The Risk Management Committee is discussed under the subheading "Board Committees–Risk Management Committee" of this proxy statement. 
Board Tenure Limits
The policies of the board of directors require that directors retire from the board at the next annual meeting of our shareholders which occurs after the director's 72nd birthday. Mr. Stauffer, a member of our board and Chair of our Audit Committee, turned 72 in 2017, and Ms. Mahone, a member of our board, turned 72 in 2018.  However, given our pending merger with TCF Financial Corporation, each of their breadth of knowledge with respect to our operations, and, with respect to Mr. Stauffer, his role as Chair of our Audit Committee, and, with respect to Ms. Mahone, her executive level experience in human resources, the board of directors determined that it was in our best interests to waive the mandatory retirement policy with respect to Mr. Stauffer and Ms. Mahone in 2019, and re-nominate each to serve an additional one-year term.  In addition, directors are required to submit a resignation in the event of a significant change in the director's personal or professional circumstances that would reasonably cause a re-examination of the director's continued membership on the board. The decision whether to accept the resignation is determined by the full board.
The board of directors has adopted a policy limiting the tenure of any director to a maximum period of 12 years. Under the policy, members of the board of directors who were serving as of the date of adoption of the policy may serve for up to an additional period of 12 years from that date, subject to our policy requiring mandatory retirement for directors at age 72. Prospectively, newly elected directors may serve for a period of 12 years, or until mandatory retirement at age 72, whichever occurs first. The policy provides that the 12 year service limitation may be modified by the board of directors in individual cases, if the particular expertise of a director and the needs of the Corporation make it desirable to grant such an extension.
Uncontested Election Director Resignation Policy 
In an uncontested election of directors (i.e., an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the board of directors), any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee must promptly consider the resignation and recommend to the board of directors whether to accept or reject the resignation. The board of directors must then act on the committee's recommendation and determine whether to accept or reject the recommendation. Following the board's decision, we will promptly disclose the board of directors' decision and process (including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the resignation) in a periodic or current report filed with the SEC. Any director who tenders his or her resignation is not permitted to participate in the committee's recommendation or the board's decision.
Assessment of Board Performance
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for coordinating the annual evaluation of the board of directors' performance. The committee will receive comments from all directors relative to the board's performance and such comments will be discussed with the full board. The purpose of the evaluation is to increase the effectiveness of the board as a whole and not to focus on the performance of individual directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating committee will also utilize the results of this evaluation process when determining the characteristics and assessing critical skills required of prospective candidates for nomination or appointment to the board and making recommendations to the board with respect to assignments of directors to the various board committees. 
The board of directors and each committee of the board of directors conducts an annual self-assessment survey. The survey utilizes questionnaires completed by each board and committee member. The responses are compiled and shared with the board, and provide a useful tool for evaluation of the effectiveness of our governance and management. Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process and our internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures on behalf of the board of directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the application of accounting and financial principles, the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial statements, the systems of internal controls and other procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures that are included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and estimates, the clarity of disclosures in and concerning the financial statements, and the internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures that support management's accounting and disclosure judgments and the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Audit Committee also reviewed management's report on its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firm's report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
All audit and non-audit services provided to us by our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), and the associated fees are pre-approved by the Audit Committee or by the Chair of the Audit Committee pursuant to delegated authority, and the Committee considers the compatibility of such non-audit services with the registered public accounting firms' independence. The Audit Committee evaluated the performance of KPMG, including the senior audit engagement team, and determined to retain KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2019. In doing so, the Audit Committee considered the quality and efficiency of the services provided by KPMG and its technical expertise, tenure as our independent registered public accounting firm, and knowledge of our operations and industry. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee continued its long-standing practice of recommending that the board of directors ask shareholders to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm at the 2019 Annual Meeting (see Proposal 2 – Ratification of Appointment of KPMG). KPMG has served as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for thirteen years. The Audit Engagement Partner rotates every five years, and the Audit Committee is involved in the selection of the Audit Engagement Partner.
The Audit Committee's meetings included executive sessions with KPMG and with our director of internal audit. The Audit Committee meets with our internal audit staff and KPMG, with and without management present, to discuss the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, results of their examinations, their evaluations of internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. The Audit Committee's meetings also included reviewing our planned public disclosures of quarterly and annual financial results, including review with management and KPMG of our financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q before filing with the SEC and of matters relating to our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures for such filings.
Numerous other informal meetings and communications among the Audit Committee Chair, various Audit Committee members, KPMG, the director of internal audit, the chief financial officer and the director of risk management also occurred. The agenda for each of the Audit Committee's meetings is established by the Audit Committee Chair and the director of internal audit. 
In its meetings with representatives of KPMG, the Audit Committee asked them to address, and discuss their responses to, questions relevant to the Audit Committee's oversight. These discussions included significant accounting judgments or estimates made by management in preparing our financial statements, fair presentation to investors in the financial statements of our financial position and performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and SEC disclosure requirements, and implementation of internal controls and internal audit procedures that are appropriate for the Corporation. 
KPMG is responsible for expressing an opinion as to whether our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG the firm's assessment of our internal controls and the matters required to be disclosed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." The Audit Committee has also received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence", and has conducted a discussion with KPMG regarding its independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has received written materials addressing KPMG's internal quality control procedures.  Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors (and the board approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements and management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to be filed with the SEC. A copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K is part of the Annual Report to Shareholders included with these proxy materials.

• successfully recruiting an outstanding team of commercial lenders to drive growth in our West Michigan, Southeast Michigan and Cleveland markets; 
• targeting lending growth in products with higher returns; 
• upgrading our core operating systems to assist in our preparation for future growth, regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction;  
• reducing expenses; and 
• becoming Detroit's Hometown Bank with the city's selection of Chemical Bank as its new primary banking partner for managing the city's operating accounts, with expected balances of up to $500 million in deposits, and the move of our headquarters to Detroit. 
[END TABLE]
We produced solid earnings and balance sheet growth in 2018, and reinvested a portion of our cost savings from our 2017 restructuring efforts into enhancements in our core operating systems and the hiring of commercial lenders and other key operational staff, all while maintaining a strong efficiency ratio.  
Key performance highlights during the year included:
Continued Net Income Growth
Our net income was $284.0 million in 2018, representing an increase of 90.0% over 2017 and 162.9% over 2016.  Our 2018 annual incentive plan included a corporate performance metric based on our adjusted core net income, which was earned at 142.9% of target based on our 2018 adjusted core net income of $276.9 million. See the "Elements of Compensation - Annual Cash Incentive Plan" section of this CD&A for additional information about our adjusted core net income.  Efficiency Ratio
Our efficiency ratio is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income. Our efficiency ratio was 54.3% for 2018, 60.1% for 2017 and 67.2% for 2016. Our 2018 annual incentive plan included a corporate performance metric based on our adjusted efficiency ratio, which was achieved at 100% of target based on an adjusted efficiency ratio of 52%. See the "Elements of Compensation - Annual Cash Incentive Plan" section of this CD&A for additional information about our adjusted efficiency ratio. 
Strong Loan and Deposit Growth
We experienced organic loan growth of $2.10 billion for 2018, compared to 2017, partially offset by run-off in our acquired loan portfolio of $982.8 million. Our total loans were $15.3 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.11 billion, or 7.9%, from total loans of $14.2 billion at December 31, 2017. When considering growth, we consider the highest quality loan growth for us to be in commercial and industrial loans and in owner-occupied commercial real estate, which contributed $616.9 million and $246.0 million, respectively, of our loan growth for 2018. Together, these two loan categories were responsible for 77.4% of our loan growth during 2018.
We grew our total deposits by $1.95 billion, or 14.3%, to $15.59 billion for 2018, compared to total deposits for 2017 of $13.64 billion. While competition for deposits remained strong throughout our markets during 2018 and 2017, our efforts to expand deposit relationships with existing and new customers, our financial strength and a general trend in customers holding more liquid assets have resulted in continuing increases in customer deposits. Total Shareholder Return
We believe that our total shareholder return, as measured over the long-term, is a valuable and useful tool in gauging company performance and executive compensation alignment with that performance. We also recognize that proxy advisory firms use total shareholder return to assist in their determination of executive pay alignment over one- and three-year periods. We believe using metrics at specific points in time may result in misleading conclusions when taken out of context or without an understanding of the dynamics driving the results. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, amid concerns over the health of the broader economy, bank stocks in addition to the S&P 500 index as a whole, including our company and many of our peer banks, experienced erosion in stock price and market capitalization. As a result of this recent market volatility, our one-year total shareholder return decreased from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, although our total shareholder return over the one-year period continued to compare favorably to the KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking Index.

Below we have summarized key events and compensation decisions regarding our named executive officers that the Committee made regarding 2018 compensation.
Annual Incentive Plan and Metrics
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On February 27, 2018, based on the recommendation of the Committee, our board of directors approved the Chemical Financial Corporation Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which we refer to as our annual incentive plan. The Committee also established performance objectives under the plan for 2018, including adjusted net income and adjusted efficiency ratio, as well as individual performance objectives. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash incentive payouts in 2018 under our annual incentive plan for all employees, including our NEOs, were earned at 127.5% of target based on our performance and each executive's individual performance, but included the application of negative discretion by the Committee reducing cash payments to 102% of target, as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ Specifically, the Committee noted that while our total shareholder return, or TSR, over the preceding five-year period was higher than the KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking Index, the general stock market decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in a decline in our share value at year-end, causing the Committee to exercise its discretion to reduce actual incentive payouts despite our achievement of the financial metrics under the plan (representing 80% of total award for NEOs) at a level equal to 134.3% of target to 102% of target for Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ The Committee further determined that to more closely align the interests of David Provost, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Torgow, our Executive Chairman, with those of our shareholders, it would exercise its discretion under the annual incentive plan not to award a cash incentive payment to either Mr. Provost or Mr. Torgow in 2018.  Instead, the Committee awarded each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow 20,364 shares of time-vesting restricted stock units ("TRSUs") under the 2017 Stock Plan with a grant date fair value equal to approximately $950,000, which approximates the target amount Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow would have been eligible to receive under the annual incentive plan despite corporate and individual performance earned at 127.5% of target in 2018.  Under the restricted stock unit agreement, the TRSUs will vest in equal annual installments over a three-year-period, subject to each officer's continued service through the vesting date, subject to certain exceptions.   
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards and Metrics
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term equity incentive grants in 2018 consisted of annual grants and a strategic award, each consisting of a mix of 60% performance-based restricted stock units, or PRSUs, and 40% TRSUs, as set forth in the table below.  The TRSUs vest over a period of five years.  The performance metrics underlying the PRSUs are cumulative earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.  Mr. Ryan's long-term equity awards in 2018 were made pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In granting the strategic award, the Committee looked at a number of factors, including each executive's (a) evolving roles and additional responsibilities, (b) unique ability to drive business to our bank, (c) ability to build strategic partnerships that advance our key business objectives, and (d) their involvement and visibility within our communities that elevates both our visibility and standing.  In light of these factors, the Committee also considered the unvested equity position of each executive in Chemical and the potential for disruption to our business, as well as the impact on shareholder value should any of our named executive officers leave, particularly Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow, and determined that it was in the best interests of Chemical and our shareholders to grant additional equity-based awards.  The strategic awards are not intended to be an ongoing component of our named executive officer annual compensation and the 2019 target long-term annual incentive awards approved by the Committee in February 2019 (to be disclosed in next year's proxy statement) were, on average (excluding Mr. Ryan), 33% less than the total target long-term annual incentive awards granted in 2018.

Overview of Our Executive Compensation Program
Our executive compensation program is aligned with our growth-oriented business strategy and is designed to drive short- and medium-term performance results as well as long-term, shareholder value creation. We provide pay packages to our executives that are intended to compensate fairly, attract the best leaders in the banking industry, and engage and motivate them to deliver strong results.  
The Compensation Committee considers peer group market data and the advice of its independent consultant when establishing compensation packages for executives or making decisions related to incentive plan design. We seek to create and annually calibrate an appropriate mix of cash and non-cash compensation, short and long-term incentives, and fixed and at-risk compensation to balance internal priorities with shareholder expectations, short-term results with long-term vision and stability with innovation.  The Compensation Committee believes that performance expectations should be clearly articulated and directly tied to compensation outcomes.  Our executive pay program consists of three major elements and a number of practices explicitly designed to promote good governance. Each component helps us attract and retain high-performing executives. In addition, these compensation elements have the objectives described below:

[END TABLE]
Objectives and Philosophy
Our philosophy on executive compensation is to align the interests of our executive management with the interests of our shareholders and to ensure that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is reasonable, motivating and competitive.  We also recognize the need to differentiate compensation by individual, reflecting on his or her role, experience, performance, and expected contributions.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Guiding Principles 
Align Executive Compensation with Shareholder Value Creation    Within our overall compensation strategy, we use equity-based compensation to align the financial interests and objectives of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders.  In addition, our annual and long-term incentive goals and payouts are designed so that target and above-target compensation levels are achieved only when our financial and relative market performance indicate that intrinsic value has been created.

In addition, our annual and long-term incentive goals and payouts are designed so that target and above-target compensation levels are achieved only when our financial and relative market performance indicate that intrinsic value has been created.  
Attract, Retain and Motivate High-Performing Executive Talent    We operate in a competitive employment environment and our employees, led by our named executive officers, are essential to our success.  The compensation of our named executive officers, while designed to be competitive within the marketplace for similar positions with bank holding companies of comparable size, is also designed to motivate the named executive officers to maximize our performance.  We believe that our high-performing executives should receive compensation that reflects their value to our organization and retains them in our service.

Link Pay to Performance     Our compensation program is designed to provide a strong correlation between the performance of the named executive officers and the compensation the named executive officers receive.  We accomplish this by including compensation elements that are designed to reward our named executive officers based on our overall performance and the executives' abilities to achieve the performance priorities established by the Committee.  
Manage Risk     We employ features to mitigate against our executives taking excessive risk in order to maximize pay-outs, including varied and balanced performance targets, discretionary authority of the Committee to reduce award pay-outs, maximum caps on annual incentive payments, and an incentive compensation recoupment policy, or "clawback" policy.

[END TABLE]
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote Results
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 96% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were in favor of approving the resolution. The Compensation Committee considers the results of this advisory resolution when evaluating and establishing our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee believes that these voting results reflect strong confidence in our board to exercise good judgment in structuring a thoughtful executive compensation program that benefits our shareholders. The Compensation Committee intends to continuously improve our executive compensation arrangements and programs to meet evolving business conditions, address retention concerns and ensure consistent alignment with shareholder interests.
Compensation Decision-Making Process
Role of the Compensation and Pension Committee
The Compensation Committee assists the board of directors in discharging its responsibilities relating to executive compensation and in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to our compensation and benefit programs and policies. Under the Compensation and Pension Committee Charter, the Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving total compensation, including base salary, bonus, annual cash incentive awards, long-term incentive awards, benefits and other compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers of the Corporation. The Committee also is also responsible for, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annually reviewing and approving the corporate and individual goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annually reviewing and approving the compensation of our other executive officers; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing, recommending and approving the design of retirement, stock incentive, cash incentive, welfare and other compensation and benefit plans and administering such plans as approved by the board, subject to the provisions of each plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing, recommending and approving employment agreements and other arrangements for executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee currently consists of five directors, all of whom are independent under NASDAQ listing rules. Role of Leadership
The Committee, along with the entire board of directors, believes that an empowered leadership team is critical to our ability to respond efficiently and successfully to important business issues. As such, the Committee has delegated limited reasonable authority for certain decisions and activities, as permitted by the Compensation Committee Charter, to the Chief Executive Officer, the Vice Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemical Bank, and other members of our executive leadership team. In that regard, the Committee has delegated to certain executive officers, by means of our Equity Grant Delegation Policy, the authority to award a limited number of TRSUs to employees who are not executive officers as defined by Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Committee calls upon our executive leadership team from time to time to support the Committee in the fulfillment of its duties. Executive leadership provides recommendations related to a number of matters that are subject to the Committee's review and approval, including the compensation of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the design of our incentive plans and the financial goals on which these incentive plans are based. The Committee retains absolute discretion in determining whether to approve recommendations made by our executive leadership.
Role of Compensation Consultants
From 2011 until September 2018, the Committee engaged Aon Hewitt, which we refer to as Aon, to serve as independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee on matters related to executive and director compensation. Specifically, Aon assisted the Committee in the design of the Chemical Financial Corporation Executive Annual Incentive Plan adopted in February 2018. Aon also helped the Committee select performance objectives under the plan and gave the Committee an analysis of compensation practices of peer companies so the Committee could analyze how our programs fit within industry standards.   
In September 2018, the Committee concluded its relationship with Aon and engaged Pay Governance LLC to serve as independent compensation consultant. In its role, Pay Governance has consulted with the Committee and has provided information on peer group selection, market analysis for executive compensation, and has reviewed our incentive plans.
The Committee conducted a review of its relationships with Aon and Pay Governance in 2018 and determined that their work did not create any conflicts of interest. The Compensation Committee also determined that both Aon and Pay Governance are independent under the criteria included in NASDAQ listing standards.
Compensation Risk Assessment
The Committee annually evaluates our compensation programs to assess whether our programs, by design or administrative process, would facilitate or encourage excessive risk-taking by executives or other employees. In 2018, the Committee reviewed our compensation programs, including an internal risk assessment, and concluded that our compensation programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. With respect to our executive compensation programs specifically, the Committee based its conclusion, in part, on the fact that our programs contain the following design elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amounts that may be earned under annual and long-term incentive awards are limited, which diminishes the potential reward of excessive risk taking; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• financial metrics for incentive awards are aligned with our financial goals and strategic plan and are both challenging and reasonable, which motivates our executives to take appropriate, rather than risky or excessive, actions to achieve those goals; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock ownership guidelines require executives to have significant "skin-in-the-game," creating a disincentive for imprudent decision-making.  
[END TABLE]
Additional best practices we employ to mitigate executive compensation risk include: an anti-hedging policy, multi-year vesting of equity awards, a formal clawback policy and double-trigger change of control arrangements.
Competitive Market Analysis
Our Committee compares our executive compensation levels and programs to a group of like peer companies with whom we compete for talent.  The Committee reviews peer group market data and practices at least annually, and evaluates it as one important reference point when making decisions. The Committee meets at least once annually in executive session to review market assessments provided by its independent consultant for Mr. Torgow, Mr. Provost and Mr. Shafer. The Committee also reviews  market assessments for our other executive officers, and in conjunction with Mr. Shafer's recommendations, makes appropriate adjustments to their compensation, as needed.
2018 Peer Group
Each year the Committee works with our independent compensation consultant to review compensation for executive positions within a designated peer group of companies to ensure the overall appropriateness and competitiveness of our compensation levels and programs, although the Committee did not benchmark the amount of 2018 compensation or otherwise target our compensation to any specific percentile or range with respect to our peer group.
Our 2018 Peer Group consisted of the following 16 companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
BancorpSouth, Inc. Hancock Holding Company TFS Financial Corp 
BankUnited, Inc. IBERIABANK Corporation Trustmark Corporation 
F.N.B. Corporation MB Financial, Inc. UMB Financial Corporation 
Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. Old National Bancorp United Bankshares, Inc. 
Fulton Financial Corporation TCF Financial Corporation Valley National Bancorp 
  Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.   
[END TABLE]
As we evolve, we continue to revisit and refine our peer group, as needed.  To select peers for 2018, we worked with Aon to consider regional banks or chartered thrifts that generally fit within the following criteria:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assets between $10 billion and $25 billion, based on fiscal year 2017 results; and 
• Market capitalization of at least $500 million. 
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation
The compensation of our named executive officers primarily consists of base salary, annual incentive awards and annual grants of equity awards. The amount and mix of these elements are individually calibrated to each executive based on his or her level of responsibility and expected effect on our results. Executives also participate in our retirement plans, and may receive discretionary awards to recognize extraordinary performance as approved by the Committee. Each component of compensation is intended to accomplish one or more of the compensation objectives discussed earlier.
Base Salary
Annual base salaries are established to provide fair and competitive levels of compensation and to attract and retain executives with exceptional abilities and talent. In 2018, we entered into new employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. Each of these employment agreements set the officer's base salary, subject to annual review by the Committee. When determining the base salaries under each executive's new employment agreement, the Committee considered a variety of factors for each executive, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• individual performance, skills and achievements; 
• level of experience and corresponding current compensation, if applicable; and 
• ability to contribute to our performance. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee also considered current competitive practices of companies in our peer group, the Committee's philosophy of paying salaries that are competitive with organizations of comparable size and complexity, and the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemical Bank (for executives other than themselves). After considering all of these factors, the Committee determined that the employment agreement with each of Mr. Provost, Mr. Torgow, Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan provided an annual base salary at a level that the Committee considered reasonable, appropriate and in the best interest of the Corporation and our shareholders.   The following table details the base annual salary of our named executive officers under their employment agreements as in effect for the periods presented. See "Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table - Summary Compensation Table" below for the actual salary paid to each of our named executive officers for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years.

Annual Cash Incentive Plan
We provide an annual cash-based incentive plan in which our executive officers participate because we believe it is a critical tool for:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• holding executive leadership accountable for the financial results of the organization; 
• rewarding and reinforcing the behaviors and achievements that produce positive financial results; and 
• hiring and retaining the best executive talent in the banking industry. 
[END TABLE]
On February 27, 2018, based on the recommendation of the Committee, our board of directors approved the Chemical Financial Corporation Executive Annual Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the annual incentive plan. Under the annual incentive plan, each year, the Committee selects eligible executives who will participate in the plan and sets the amount of each participant's threshold, target and maximum award that can be awarded under the annual incentive plan, determined as a percentage of the participant's base salary. The Committee also establishes one or more performance measures and a formula to determine the amount of the award that will be earned at different levels of achievement of the performance measures. For 2018, the Committee set the potential incentive payment, expressed as a percentage of base salary, as follows.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   Threshold (%)     Threshold Incentive Payment ($)(1)      Target  (%)  Target  Incentive Payment  ($)(1)  Maximum (%)     Maximum  Incentive Payment ($)(1)

Mr. Ryan was hired in July 2018 and therefore did not participate in the annual incentive plan. Under his employment agreement, he was entitled to a guaranteed incentive payment of $520,000 in 2018. 2018 Performance Metrics
Under the annual incentive plan, the Committee is responsible for establishing the corporate and individual performance measures that, when compared to actual results, determine the amount of payout that is earned with respect to the plan. In setting these goals, the Committee considers a number of factors, including our annual budget, our short- and long-term business strategy, investor performance expectations, and guidance provided by our executive leadership team. In the first quarter of 2018, the Committee determined that the performance measures under the annual incentive plan for each named executive officer would consist of corporate financial metrics weighted at 80% and individual performance metrics weighted at 20%. 
The 2018 corporate financial metrics, weighted at 80%, were (a) adjusted core net income, and (b) adjusted efficiency ratio. The Committee believes these metrics reflect the most reliable, comprehensive financial indicators of our performance relative to our key 2018 strategic priorities of increasing profitable loan growth and improving our operating efficiency.  
The target corporate financial goals were set at challenging levels representing significant growth and improvement over 2017, and generally corresponded to or exceeded our budgeted financial plan. In 2018, adjusted core net income replaced earnings per share as the core financial metric underlying the annual incentive plan to avoid overlap with our PRSUs granted under our long-term incentive plan.  
The Committee established threshold, target and maximum performance goals for each of the two corporate financial metrics for 2018, with threshold representing the minimum level of performance for which the executive officer will earn a payment. If performance is below the threshold level for one of the corporate financial metrics, the executive officer will not earn a payment for that metric; however, the executive officer will earn a payment for the other metric if the threshold performance level is achieved. Maximum represents the maximum level of performance required to achieve the maximum (150%) payment on each of the metrics. If performance exceeds the maximum level for any corporate or individual performance metric, the executive officer will not earn a further incentive above the maximum incentive for such metric. Payments for achievement of the threshold, target and maximum goals are 50%, 100% and 150% of the target payment, respectively. Actual performance between threshold, target and maximum performance levels is interpolated linearly to determine the exact level of achievement.
The individual performance metrics, weighted at 20%, that the Committee considered were based on non-formulaic objectives, such as the implementation of actions to achieve revenue growth and profitability by attracting new customers, improving practices related to risk management, identifying potential merger and acquisition targets, engaging in leadership development, and continuing to build the Chemical brand and culture.
2018 Annual Incentive Payments
In February 2019, the Committee determined that we achieved the corporate metrics at the level detailed in the following table.
[BEGIN TABLE]
      2018 Corporate Goal Levels (% payout opportunities)  2018 Actual Performance

(2) Adjusted Efficiency Ratio under our annual incentive plan is our total operating expenses, excluding (a) the impairment of income tax credits, (b) amortization of intangibles, and (c) the excluded items described in footnote (1) above, divided by the sum of (i) net interest income, excluding the net interest income fully-tax equivalent adjustment, and (ii) noninterest income, excluding the change in fair value of loan servicing rights and gain on sales of investment securities. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee determined that each executive achieved his individual performance metrics at 100% of target. These performance outcomes resulted in potential incentive payments equal to 127.5% of the target incentive payment, as set forth in  the table below. While adjusted core net income and the adjusted core efficiency ratio were the chosen corporate metrics used by the Committee in determining awards under the annual incentive plan, the Committee also determined, in its exercise of negative discretion, to consider our total shareholder return. Although our total shareholder return over the preceding 5-year period was higher than the KBW NASDAQ Regional Banking Index, the stock market decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in decline in our share value at year-end. Accordingly, the Committee exercised its discretion to decrease overall incentive payments as a result of its review of our total shareholder return for 2018. As a result, the Committee determined to fund Mr. Klaeser's and Mr. Shafer's incentive payments at 102% of target. In addition, with respect to Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow, as noted above, the Committee re-evaluated their participation in the annual incentive plan and determined that to more closely align their interests with those of our shareholders and to increase the retention effect of their compensation packages, the Committee would exercise its discretion not to award Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow any cash incentives under the annual incentive plan for 2018. Instead, the Committee determined to grant to each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow a supplemental equity award in February 2019 with a grant date fair value equal to approximately $950,000, which approximates the target amount Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow would have been eligible to receive under the annual incentive plan despite corporate and individual performance earned at 127.5% of target in 2018. This supplemental equity grant consists of time-vesting restricted stock units, or TRSUs, that vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period, in each case subject to continued service through the vesting date, subject to certain exceptions.
The following table reflects amounts earned and actually paid under the annual incentive plan to those named executive officers who participated in, and received payments under, the annual incentive plan in 2018.

Other 2018 Cash Bonus Payment
Under Mr. Ryan's employment agreement, he received a guaranteed incentive payment of $520,000 in 2018.
Long-Term Equity Compensation
We deliver a significant portion of our executive officer compensation through long-term equity grants that are specifically designed to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure that executives have material "skin in the game," thereby aligning executive and shareholder interests;  
• reward executives for building long-term, sustainable shareholder value; and 
• complement our annual cash incentive plan to appropriately balance executive focus on both short- and long-term objectives. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, awards were provided under the 2017 Stock Plan, which our shareholders approved at the 2017 annual meeting.    Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards - February 2018
In February 2018, we continued our long-standing practice of awarding our annual long-term equity grants to our named executive officers. In setting the amount of equity awards in 2018, the Committee considered a variety of factors, including the terms of each executive officer's employment agreement, peer group data and the Committee's assessment of individual retention risk. In 2018, the Committee established annual long-term incentive awards with grant date fair values equal to between 80% and 105% of each executive's base salary in effect at the time of the award, as indicated in the table below. The actual value that the named executive officers realize from these 2018 long-term equity awards may differ from the grant date fair value of such awards due to share price appreciation or depreciation and the level at which the PRSU component of the long-term equity awards is earned. The 2018 annual long-term equity incentive awards granted to our named executive officers in February consisted of 60% PRSUs and 40% TRSUs, as described below under "Components of Annual Long-term and Strategic Awards."

[END TABLE]
Strategic Awards - February 2018
In addition to the annual long-term incentive awards, the Committee granted a special strategic award in 2018.  In granting the strategic award, the Committee looked at a number of factors, including each executive's (a) evolving roles and additional responsibilities, (b) unique ability to drive business to our bank, (c) ability to build strategic partnerships that advance our key business objectives, and their involvement and visibility within our communities that elevates both our visibility and standing. In light of these factors, the Committee considered the unvested equity position of each executive in Chemical and the potential for disruption to our business as well as the impact on shareholder value should any of our named executive officers leave, particularly Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow, and determined that it was in the best interests of Chemical and our shareholders to grant additional equity awards.  The strategic awards are not intended to be an ongoing component of our named executive officer annual compensation and the 2019 target long-term annual incentive awards approved by the Committee in February 2019 (to be disclosed in next year's proxy statement) were, on average (excluding Mr. Ryan), 33% less than the total target long-term annual incentive awards granted in 2018.  The 2018 strategic awards granted to our named executive officers in February consisted of 60% PRSUs and 40% TRSUs, as described below under "Components of Annual Long-term and Strategic Awards."
Components of Annual Long-Term and Strategic Awards
Both the 2018 annual long-term equity incentive awards and the strategic awards granted to our named executive officers in February 2018 consisted of 60% PRSUs and 40% TRSUs. The TRSUs vest in equal 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the February 27, 2018 grant date. The PRSUs are subject to conditional vesting based on the attainment of pre-established corporate performance metrics and continued service through the date our audit opinion is issued at the end of the three-year performance period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020.  The corporate performance metrics for the PRSUs awarded in February 2018 are cumulative earnings per share, weighted at 75%, and relative total shareholder return, weighted at 25%. The Committee established threshold, target and maximum performance levels for each selected goal. Payments for achievement of the threshold, target and maximum goals are 50%, 100% and 150% of the target payment, respectively. Actual performance between threshold, target and maximum performance levels will be interpolated to determine the amount of payment based on relative achievement of the corporate performance metrics.  See "Overview of Key Events and Named Executive Officer Compensation for 2018" for a table that describes the grant date fair value of both the annual long-term and strategic awards. Long-Term Incentive Grant - July 2018
Under the terms of his employment agreement, on July 9, 2018, upon joining the Corporation, Mr. Ryan received an initial equity award valued at $520,000 in the form of TRSUs that will vest in full on December 15, 2019, subject to continued service through the vesting date.
January 4, 2017 PRSU Payouts 
The performance period for the January 4, 2017 PRSUs granted to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer concluded in 2018. The performance metrics to which these PRSUs were subject were adjusted diluted earnings per share, weighted 75%, and adjusted efficiency ratio, weighted 25%. Similar to the 2018 PRSU grant, performance for each of these goals was measured on an interpolated scale ranging from 0% of target for below threshold performance, to 50% of target for threshold performance, to 100% of target for target performance to 150% of target for maximum performance. The Compensation Committee determined that payouts with respect to the performance goals were earned at 90.0% of target for the performance period, as indicated in the table below.  
The calculation of 2018 financial achievement includes certain non-GAAP adjustments that the Corporation has in prior years regularly and customarily made to its incentive plan financial results, including the exclusion of the fair value change in loan servicing rights and non-core extraordinary operating expenses, which in 2018 related exclusively to our core banking system conversion. The performance results also exclude the benefit of tax reform to prevent the enlargement of these awards due to what was an unforeseen change in the tax code when the performance goals were established.

[END TABLE]
Additional Compensation Policies and Practices
Clawback Policy ("Recoupment")
In the interest of further aligning the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders, the Compensation Committee adopted a "clawback" policy for incentive-based compensation awards made in 2014 and thereafter. The clawback policy provides that all long-term and annual incentive-based compensation, including time-vesting equity compensation and discretionary awards, that is earned after January 1, 2014 will be subject to repayment if it is paid to an executive officer in the three-year period preceding any date on which we are required to disclose a restatement of our financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws or as a result of misconduct or fraud. Repayment under the clawback provision is limited to the amount of incentive-based compensation that exceeds the amount of such compensation that the Corporation would have paid to such executive officer if the financial statements had been originally filed in their restated form. Any employee who has reasonable cause to believe that a violation under the clawback provision has occurred must promptly report such matters to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will exercise its business judgment in the fair application of the clawback policy and consider all relevant factors in determining whether the Compensation Committee will seek to recover incentive compensation from the executive officer and the amount, timing and form of any incentive compensation recovery. Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to encourage share ownership so that our executives have a direct stake in Chemical and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The ownership guidelines cover all named executive officers and are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position Required Salary Multiple 
President and Chief Executive Officer 5x base salary 
All other executive officers 3x base salary 
[END TABLE]
In general, stock ownership is determined in the same manner as beneficial ownership for SEC reporting purposes. The following share types are included under these guidelines: shares directly owned, family-owned shares, retirement plan shares and unvested TRSUs. Stock options that are unexercised, regardless of their vesting status and in-the-money value, are not counted toward satisfaction of these guidelines. Unvested PRSUs are also not counted toward stock ownership.
Executives are required to comply with these guidelines within five years of becoming subject to this policy. Individuals who acquire shares of common stock under our equity-based incentive plans must hold at least 50% of all net after-tax acquired shares until the earlier of the date at which they satisfy our stock ownership guidelines, or 36 months following acquisition of such shares.  Currently, all named executive officers are either in compliance with the guidelines or within the five-year compliance window.
Anti-Hedging Policy
Our anti-hedging policy aligns the interests of our directors and executive officers with our shareholders. The policy prohibits our directors and executive officers from engaging in any transaction that could hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our common stock, including short-selling, put or call options, forward sale or purchase contracts, equity swaps, and exchange funds.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) generally prohibits a federal income tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1,000,000 paid to a "covered employee." A "covered employee" includes (i) the Chief Executive Officer, (ii) the Chief Financial Officer, (iii) the three other most highly compensated executive officers, and (iv) any individual who was a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. Before 2018, we were permitted to receive a federal income tax deduction for qualifying "performance-based" compensation as defined under Code Section 162(m) without regard to this $1,000,000 limitation. However, recent U.S. tax legislation eliminated the performance-based exception. These new rules became effective starting in 2018 for us, except that certain equity awards that were granted on or before November 2, 2017 may still qualify as performance-based compensation. To the extent that in 2018 or any later year, the aggregate amount of any covered employee's salary, bonus, and amount realized from option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards, and certain other compensation amounts that are recognized as income for federal income tax purposes by the covered employee exceeds $1,000,000 in any year, we will not be entitled to a federal income tax deduction for the amount over $1,000,000 in that year. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers, and may determine it is appropriate to provide compensation that may exceed deductibility limits in order to recognize performance, meet market demands, retain key executives, and take into account other appropriate considerations.    
Employment Agreements
In 2018, we entered into new or amended employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. The terms have been negotiated and determined with consideration to the best interests of the Corporation and our shareholders. In attracting and securing a talented executive team, we believe we have positioned Chemical to successfully execute our growth strategy and vision.  
We describe the material terms of our employment agreements with Mr. Provost, Mr. Torgow, Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan below under "Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table."  
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements 
We provide severance benefits and in certain circumstances, change in control benefits, which are designed to retain our key executives, including our named executive officers, during a potential change in control and also to provide income continuation in the event of certain involuntary terminations. Each of our employment agreements with Mr. Provost, Mr. Torgow, Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan include certain severance payments upon termination of employment, and our employment agreements with Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan include severance benefits in connection with a change in control of the Corporation.  With respect to a change in control, each employment agreement that includes change in control provisions provides "double trigger" benefits to the executive, meaning that the severance benefits are paid only if we terminate the officer's employment generally without cause or the executive either terminates his employment for good reason or experiences a good reason event (as applicable) following a change in control.  For a detailed description of the severance and change in control benefits applicable to our named executive officers, see the discussion below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."

The PRSUs were determined to have a value at the grant date based on management's assessment that it was probable that the PRSUs would vest in 2021 at 1.0x the number of units granted. However, if the highest level of performance conditions with respect to the PRSUs granted in 2018 are satisfied, then the value of the PRSUs, determined as of the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Provost – $2,671,010; Mr. Klaeser – $890,337; Mr. Torgow – $2,671,010; Mr. Shafer – $890,337.

(7) In February 2019, the Committee determined that each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow was eligible to receive a cash incentive payment of at least $950,000 under the 2018 annual incentive plan, based on our corporate performance and his individual performance relative to the goals established by the Committee.  However, the Committee determined that to more closely align the interests of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow with those of our shareholders, it would exercise its discretion under the plan not to award a cash incentive payment to either Mr. Provost or Mr. Torgow for 2018.  Instead, in February 2019, the Committee awarded each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow time-vesting restricted stock units, or TRSUs, under the 2017 Stock Plan with a grant date fair value equal to $950,000 (the target amount each officer would have been eligible to receive under the annual incentive plan).  The TRSUs vest ratably over a three-year-period, in each case subject to continued service through the vesting date, subject to certain exceptions.

Employment Agreements with Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow 
On February 27, 2018, we entered into new executive employment agreements with each of Mr. Provost, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mr. Torgow, the Executive Chairman of our board of directors, each of whom continued to serve in  these roles under their new employment agreements. These new employment agreements supersede and replace each executive's prior employment agreement dated August 9, 2017.    
Each employment agreement has an initial term of two years that commenced on March 1, 2018, the effective date, that automatically renews for successive one-year periods, unless either party provides the other party with notice of intention to terminate at least 30 days before an anniversary of the effective date, in which case the agreement will terminate at the end of the then-current term.  Under the new employment agreements, each executive's annual base salary was increased from $1.00 to $950,000 effective July 1, 2018. Each executive's base salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee at least annually and can be increased in the Committee's sole discretion. In addition to base salary, each executive is:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eligible to participate in our annual bonus and equity programs for senior executives; 
• entitled to an annual taxable stipend to cover deduction for other benefits under our group health care plan or for any other purpose in the amount of $20,000, with such stipend terminating on June 30, 2018; 
• eligible to participate in such employee benefit programs as are generally made available to our senior executives; 
• entitled to a monthly automobile allowance of $900; and 
• eligible for reimbursement for membership in two country clubs of his selection. 
[END TABLE]
Each of the employment agreements provides for certain payments upon termination, as described below under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." Each employment agreement also requires the executive to keep corporate information confidential. In addition, each executive is subject to provisions related to non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees for a period of 24 months following termination of his employment.

Under the employment agreement, Mr. Klaeser will receive an annual base salary of $750,000, and Mr. Shafer will receive an annual base salary of $950,000. Each officer's base salary will be reviewed by the Compensation Committee at least annually beginning in 2019 and is subject to adjustment. In addition to base salary, each executive is:

Pension Benefits in 2018 
We have a noncontributory Pension Plan that is considered a tax-qualified retirement plan. Under the Pension Plan, we have the authority to change or terminate the Pension Plan at any time. Effective June 30, 2006, we stopped accepting new participant in the Pension Plan.  Since all of our NEOs joined Chemical after 2006, none of our NEOs are participants in the Pension Plan. In addition, in July 2017, the Compensation Committee determined to freeze the Pension Plan such that no additional benefits would be accrued under the Pension Plan.
Deferred Compensation
In September 2006, the board of directors approved the Chemical Financial Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DC Plan"), a voluntary nonqualified supplemental retirement program for a select group of management personnel. The DC Plan is unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of ERISA. The named executive officers in this proxy statement are eligible to participate  in the DC Plan. The DC Plan was amended on January 1, 2017 to allow an employer discretionary contribution to make up for lost employer contributions in the 401k Plan.  
Participants may elect to defer up to 85% of their compensation to the DC Plan. The election to defer compensation under the DC Plan is irrevocable for each plan year as of the beginning of the plan year. Participant contributions are made into a grantor trust for the purpose of providing for payment of the deferred compensation under this plan. The investment of employee contributions are self-directed by participants within an established array of money market, equity and fixed income mutual funds. The aggregate earnings on these investments, by each named executive officer who is a participant in the DC Plan, are included in the table below, and are attributable to the specific investments selected by each participant. Participants may change the designation of their investments at such times as mutually agreed by the parties. As of December 31, 2018, participants could change their investment designation on a daily basis. 
Participants elect, in advance of the deferral of their compensation, when the funds will be distributable. The aggregate balances of the participants are distributable, as designated by each participant, during January of the calendar year following the calendar year in which any of the following occur: the participant's termination of employment; a change in control; the participant's death or disability; an unforeseeable emergency; or at a specified time, as determined by the participant. The DC plan allows distributions to be made in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments. Participants may change their current distribution election as long as the change is made at least 12 months prior to their first payment and is delayed by at least 5 years.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Each of our employment agreements with Mr. Provost, Mr. Torgow, Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan provide for certain severance payments upon termination of employment, including with respect to Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan, upon a qualifying termination following a change in control of the Corporation, each subject to the executive's execution of a general release and waiver of claims against us or our affiliates.  
Each executive's employment agreement provides that his employment may be terminated:
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition to the employment agreements, certain equity award agreements with each executive provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards on the occurrence of certain events, as described below. Agreements with Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow
Employment Agreements dated February 27, 2018
Mr. Provost's and Mr. Torgow's employment agreements each provide that if the executive is terminated by us without "cause" or the executive terminates his employment for "good reason," each as defined in the employment agreement, then the executive is entitled to receive severance pay in the amount of two times executive's then base salary (disregarding any reduction in base salary due to a good reason termination and with base salary calculated as the higher of actual base salary or $950,000), plus two times the average of executive's bonuses under our annual cash incentive plan for each of the three most recently completed calendar years, including complete calendar years with Talmer Bank and Trust (with each bonus calculated as the higher of the actual bonus or $1.5 million). We will also pay each executive a lump sum amount equal to 24 times the executive's monthly contribution towards COBRA for employee dependent health, prescription drug and dental coverage elections under our employee benefit plans providing such benefits, minus the COBRA administrative cost (whether or not executive elects COBRA). Our decision not to renew the term of the employment agreements will also constitute our termination of the agreement without cause.    
In addition, all equity-based awards granted to the executive on or after February 27, 2018 that remain outstanding on the date executive (a) is terminated by us without "cause," (b) terminates his employment for "good reason," or (c) dies, the awards will be treated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all unvested stock options will immediately vest, and together with other vested stock options, will remain exercisable for a period of up to three years from termination; 
• all outstanding TRSUs will automatically vest and be convertible into our common stock; and 
• all PRSUs will automatically vest at the 100% of the applicable target level. 
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Awards Assumed from Talmer Bancorp, Inc. (granted before the February 27, 2018 Employment Agreements)
Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow each entered into restricted stock award agreements with Talmer Bancorp, Inc., which we assumed in our merger with Talmer Bancorp, Inc.  Under these restricted stock agreements, any unvested shares of restricted stock will immediately vest upon the executive's termination without cause (as defined in the agreement).  All remaining restricted stock awards granted under these agreements vested in February 2019.
TRSU and PRSU Agreements dated February 27, 2018
We entered into TRSU and PRSU agreements with each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow on February 27, 2018 that provide that, in the event of the executive's termination due to disability, or if the executive provides one year written notice before his intended retirement (as defined in the 2017 Stock Plan), then executive will be issued (a) with respect to TRSUs, a pro rata number of TRSUs based on the number of months that have passed since the last annual vesting date, or if no vesting date has occurred, the grant date, and (b) with respect to PRSUs, a pro rata number of PRSUs granted at the target (100%) level based on the number of months that have elapsed between the first day of the "performance period" (as defined in the agreement) and the effective date of the executive's termination. As described above, each executive's Employment Agreement will govern the treatment of TRSUs and PRSUs granted under the TRSU and PRSU Agreements dated February 27, 2018 in the event the executive (a) is terminated by us without "cause," (b) terminates his employment for "good reason," or (c) dies. See "-Agreements with Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow-Employment Agreements dated February 27, 2018."
TRSU and PRSU Agreements dated February 25, 2019
We entered into TRSU and PRSU agreements with each of Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow on February 25, 2019. Under such TRSU agreements, if the executive is terminated without "cause" by us or the executive terminates his employment for "good reason," in either case following a "change in control" (each as defined in the agreement), all TRSUs granted to the executive, including TRSUs issued under prior agreements and plans, will 100% vest. Under such PRSU agreements, in the event of a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), all PRSUs granted to the executive, including PRSUs issued under prior agreements and plans, for which performance results have not been measured will be measured as of the latest practicable date prior to the consummation of the change in control and the number of PRSUs will be fixed at the greater of the target (100%) performance level or actual performance (the "Earned Awards"), and such Earned Awards will vest and be subject to forfeiture based on the executive's continued service through the performance period. If, however, the executive is terminated without cause by us or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, in either case following a change in control, such Earned Awards will 100% vest.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), and any employment, retention or change in control agreement with the executive (an "individual agreement") and/or the terms of the 2017 Stock Plan, the provisions of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), or, to the extent more favorable, the individual agreement will  control; provided, however, that any provisions of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable) relating to the timing of settlement or payment in respect of the TRSUs or PRSUs (as applicable) will control in the event of any conflict between the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), the 2017 Stock Plan, any prior plan and the award agreements thereunder, and any individual agreement.
Agreements with Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer 
Employment Agreements dated July 1, 2018 (and Stock Options and PRSU Agreements granted before November 2, 2017)
The following is a description of the severance benefits under our employment agreements with each of Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer dated July 1, 2018, and our stock option and PRSU agreements with Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer granted before November 2, 2017.
Termination Without Cause by Chemical or for Good Reason by the Executive.  Under the employment agreements, if Mr. Klaeser's or Mr. Shafer's employment is terminated without "cause" by us or for "good reason" by the executive (each as defined in the agreement), and such termination is not within six months before or two years after a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), each is entitled to receive severance in the amount of two times the executive's then current base salary (disregarding any reduction in base salary due to a good reason termination) plus the average of the executive's cash bonuses under our annual cash incentive plan for each of the three most recently completed calendar years (or such lesser number of completed calendar years that executive has been employed by us), payable in equal installments over 104 weeks. We will also pay each executive a lump sum health care stipend in the amount of $10,000, and will provide each executive with executive-level outplacement services for a period not to exceed 12 months.  
Under the employment agreements, at the time of such termination, the restrictions on all time-vesting restricted stock will lapse, all TRSUs will immediately vest and convert into shares of our common stock, and all PRSUs will be settled at 100% of target; provided, that, any stock options or PRSUs granted before November 2, 2017, will continue to be subject to their terms on such date. The PRSU award agreements granted on February 21, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) and on August 9, 2017 (to Mr. Shafer) provide that (a) if the executive is terminated without cause, then the restrictions on such PRSUs will lapse on a pro rata basis based on the number of full months that have elapsed since the grant date divided by the number of full months in the restricted period; provided, that, the restrictions will not lapse until the end of the applicable performance period and then only if we satisfied the applicable performance conditions, and (b) if the executive terminates his employment for good reason, the unvested PRSUs will be forfeited.  The PRSU award agreements granted on January 4, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) and the outstanding stock option award agreements (to Mr. Shafer) provide that such unvested equity awards will automatically be forfeited if the executive is terminated without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason.
Termination Six Months Before or Within Two Years Following a Change in Control.  Under the employment agreements, if Mr. Klaeser's employment is terminated without cause by us or if he terminates his employment for good reason, or if Mr. Shafer's employment is terminated without cause by us, within two years following a change in control within six months before the date of a change in control, we will pay each executive a lump sum cash payment in the amount of two times the executive's then current base salary (disregarding any reduction in base salary due to a good reason termination) plus the average of the executive's cash bonuses under our annual cash incentive plan for each of the most recent three complete calendar years (or such lesser number of completed calendar years that executive has been employed by us), which we refer to as the "change in control payment." We will also pay each executive a lump sum health care stipend in the amount of $10,000, and will provide each executive with executive-level outplacement services for a period not to exceed 12 months. In addition, with respect to Mr. Shafer, if during the term of his agreement, a good reason event occurs within two years following a change in control, he will receive a lump sum retention bonus in the amount of the change in control payment. If Mr. Shafer received such a retention bonus, he will no longer be entitled to a change in control or other cash severance payment if he is later terminated by us without cause.
Under the employment agreements, unless specified otherwise in the purchase agreement or other controlling agreement, unvested stock options outstanding at the time of a change in control will continue to vest under the vesting schedule, and if we are not the surviving entity, all unvested stock options will be converted into shares of the surviving entity's common stock at the applicable exchange ratio; provided, that, any stock options granted before November 2, 2017, will continue to be subject to their terms on such date.  
All of Mr. Shafer's outstanding stock options were awarded before November 2, 2017, and under these award agreements, if he is terminated by us without cause or he terminates his employment for "good reason" following a "change in control" (each as defined in the award agreement), then any stock options assumed by the surviving corporation will become fully exercisable, or will be paid out in cash if such stock options have not been assumed. Generally, the treatment of TRSUs and PRSUs following a change in control is set forth below under "TRSU and PRSU Agreements dated February 25, 2019," unless the treatment of such equity awards under the executive's employment agreement is deemed more favorable. Death or Disability.  Under the employment agreements, neither Mr. Klaeser nor Mr. Shafer is entitled to any additional severance payments in the event of termination of his employment due to death or disability. However, under the employment agreements, in the event of either executive's death or disability, all equity-based awards will be treated as follows: all unvested stock options will immediately vest, the restrictions on all time-vesting restricted stock will lapse, all TRSUs will immediately vest and be convertible into shares of our common stock, and all PRSUs will be settled at 100% of target; provided, that, any stock options or PRSUs granted before November 2, 2017, will continue to be subject to their terms on such date.  
All of Mr. Shafer's outstanding stock options were awarded before November 2, 2017, and under these award agreements, upon his death or disability, all unvested stock options will be forfeited and vested stock options will remain exercisable until the earlier of the date such options expire or one year after his death or disability.  The PRSU award agreements granted on February 21, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) and on August 9, 2017 (to Mr. Shafer) provide that if the executive is terminated because of his death or disability, then the restrictions on such PRSUs will lapse on a pro rata basis based on the number of full months that have elapsed since the grant date divided by the number of full months in the restricted period; provided, that, the restrictions will not lapse until the end of the applicable performance period and then only if we satisfied the applicable performance conditions.  The PRSU award agreements granted on January 4, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) provide that such unvested equity awards will automatically be forfeited if the executive is terminated because of death or disability.
Retirement.  Under the employment agreements, if Mr. Klaeser's or Mr. Shafer's employment is terminated due to "retirement" with one year's advance notice, as defined in each agreement, then all equity-based awards will be treated as follows: all unvested stock options will immediately vest, the restrictions on all time-vesting restricted stock will lapse, all TRSUs will immediately vest and be convertible into shares of our common stock, and all PRSUs will be settled at 100% of target; provided, that, any stock options or PRSUs granted before November 2, 2017, will continue to be subject to their terms on such date.  
All of Mr. Shafer's outstanding stock options were awarded before November 2, 2017, and under these award agreements, upon his retirement, all unvested stock options will terminate and vested stock options will remain exercisable until the earlier of the date such options expire or three years after his retirement.  The PRSU award agreements granted on February 21, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) and on August 9, 2017 (to Mr. Shafer) provide that, in the event the executive provides one year advance notice of his "retirement," as defined in the applicable equity plan, then the restrictions on such PRSUs will lapse on a pro rata basis based on the number of full months that have elapsed since the grant date divided by the number of full months in the restricted period; provided, that, the restrictions will not lapse until the end of the applicable performance period and then only if we satisfied the applicable performance conditions.  If, however, the executive retires without providing one year advanced notice, any such unvested PRSUs will be forfeited.  The PRSU award agreements granted on January 4, 2017 (to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer) provide that if the executive retires (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan of 2015), with or without notice, then the restrictions on such PRSUs will lapse on a pro rata basis based on the number of full months that have elapsed since the grant date divided by the number of full months in the restricted period; provided, that, the restrictions will not lapse until the end of the applicable performance period and then only if we satisfied the applicable performance conditions.
TRSU and PRSU Agreements dated February 25, 2019
We entered into TRSU and PRSU agreements with each of Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer on February 25, 2019.  Under such TRSU agreements, if the executive is terminated without "cause" by us or the executive terminates his employment for "good reason," in either case following a "change in control" (each as defined in the agreement), all TRSUs granted to the executive, including TRSUs issued under prior agreements and plans, will 100% vest. Under such PRSU agreements, in the event of a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), all PRSUs granted to the executive, including PRSUs issued under prior agreements and plans, for which performance results have not been measured will be measured as of the latest practicable date prior to the consummation of the change in control and the number of PRSUs will be fixed at the greater of the target (100%) performance level or actual performance (the "Earned Awards"), and such Earned Awards will vest and be subject to forfeiture based on the executive's continued service through the performance period. If, however, the executive is terminated without cause by us or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, in either case following a change in control, such Earned Awards will 100% vest.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), and any employment, retention or change in control agreement with the executive (each an "individual agreement") and/or the terms of the 2017 Stock Plan, the provisions of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), or, to the extent more favorable, the individual agreement will control; provided, however, that any provisions of the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable) relating to the timing of settlement or payment in respect of the TRSUs or PRSUs (as applicable) will control in the event of any conflict between the TRSU or PRSU agreement (as applicable), the 2017 Stock Plan, any prior plan and the award agreements thereunder, and any individual agreement.   Agreements with Mr. Ryan
Employment Agreement dated July 9, 2018
Termination Without Cause by the Corporation or for Good Reason by the Executive.  Under his employment agreement, if Mr. Ryan's employment is terminated without "cause" by us or for "good reason" by him (each as defined in the agreement), and such termination is not within six months before or two years after a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), he is entitled to receive a severance payment in the amount of two times his then current base salary (disregarding any reduction in base salary due to a good reason termination) plus the average of his cash bonuses under our annual cash incentive plan for each of the three most recently completed calendar years (or such lesser number of completed calendar years that executive has been employed by us), payable in one lump sum (the "severance payment"). We will also pay Mr. Ryan a lump sum health care stipend in the amount of $10,000, and will provide him with executive-level outplacement services for a period not to exceed 12 months. At the time of his termination, all outstanding equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity plan or award agreement. 
Death or Disability.  Under the employment agreement, Mr. Ryan is not entitled to any additional severance payments in the event of termination of his employment due to death or disability. At the time of termination due to death or disability, all outstanding equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity plan or award agreement. 
Termination Six Months Before or Within Two Years Following a Change in Control.  Under his employment agreement, if Mr. Ryan's employment is terminated without cause by us or for good reason by him within two years following a change in control or within six months before the date of a change in control, he is entitled to receive the above-referenced severance payment. We will also pay Mr. Ryan a lump sum health care stipend in the amount of $10,000, and will provide him with executive-level outplacement services for a period not to exceed 12 months. At the time of his termination, all outstanding equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity plan or award agreement.
TRSU Agreement dated July 9, 2018
We entered into a TRSU agreement with Mr. Ryan on July 9, 2018. Under the agreement, in the event of Mr. Ryan's termination without "cause" by us, or if he terminates his employment for "good reason" (each as defined in the agreement), or if he dies or is disabled, or if he provides one year written notice before his intended retirement after reaching age 55 with ten years of service, then all remaining restrictions on the TRSUs will lapse and such award will 100% vest. In addition, under his TRSU agreement, if Mr. Ryan is terminated without cause by us or if he terminates his employment for good reason, in either case within two years following a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), all the TRSUs will 100% vest.  
Potential Post-Employment Payments Due to Our Named Executive Officers
The following table shows potential post-employment payments due to Mr. Provost, Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Torgow, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan upon termination from the Corporation for various reasons, including a change in control of the Corporation, assuming that those events occurred on December 31, 2018.  If we terminate such named executive officer's employment for "cause" or the executive resigns, then we have no further obligation to such named executive officer except for payment of any amounts earned and unpaid as of the effective date of the termination. Accordingly, those events are omitted from the table. In addition, at December 31, 2018, none of our named executive officers were eligible for retirement and, therefore, we have omitted retirement (with or without notice) from the table as well.  We report amounts in the table without any reduction for possible delay in the commencement or timing of payments.

(1) Represents cash payments pursuant to the executive employment agreements described above, as follows: 
• Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow:  two times the executive's base salary, plus two times his average bonus of $1.5 million. 
• Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan:  two times the executive's base salary plus the average of the executive's cash bonuses under our annual cash incentive plan for each of the most recent three complete calendar years (or such lesser number of completed calendar years that executive has been employed by us).  For purposes of this calculation, we have included annual cash incentive payments earned in the year-ended 2018, even if not paid until 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Pursuant to executive employment agreements, amounts reported for each executive are as follows: 
• Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow:  a lump sum amount equal to 24 times the executive's monthly contribution towards COBRA for employee dependent health, prescription drug and dental coverage elections under our employee benefit plans providing such benefits, minus the COBRA administrative cost. 
• Mr. Klaeser, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Ryan:  a lump sum health care stipend in the amount of $10,000 and the value of executive-level outplacement services for a period not to exceed 12 months, estimated at $25,000.

(4) Amount represents the market value, excluding dividend equivalents, of unvested TRSUs that would vest in connection with a termination event on December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5) Amount represents the market value, excluding dividend equivalents, of unvested PRSUs that would vest in connection with a termination event on December 31, 2018. The valuation of these awards is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Stock Market at December 31, 2018 of $36.61 per share. With respect to the January 4, 2017 PRSUs granted to Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer for which the performance conditions were met at 90% of target at December 31, 2018, but which remained unvested at year-end, the number of shares that vested, and thus the value reflected in the table, is based on our actual performance.  With respect to all other PRSUs, the number of shares that vest for each NEO, and thus the value reflected in the table, is based on an assumption that PRSUs are achieved at the "target" performance level. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6) Amount represents the market value of unvested restricted stock awards that would vest in connection with a termination event on December 31, 2018. The valuation of these awards is based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Stock Market at December 31, 2018 of $36.61 per share.  For Mr. Provost and Mr. Torgow, vesting is determined under the applicable restricted stock agreement, as described above.  For Mr. Klaeser and Mr. Shafer, vesting is determined under each executive's employment agreement, as described above.

Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President, David Provost.  
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the total annual compensation for all employees of our company (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $40,686; and 
• the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was $3,533,580, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Provost, our Chief Executive Officer and President, to the median of the total annual compensation was approximately 87 to 1.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our Chief Executive Officer, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. We determined that as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of 3,224 individuals with all of these individuals located in the United States. This population included our full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary  
[END TABLE]
 employees. However, it did not include independent contractors who were employed by and had their compensation determined by unaffiliated third parties.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we compared the wages of our employees as reflected in our payroll records and reported in Box 5, Medicare Wages, to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2018. Because we offer a variety of compensation arrangements to our employees, including base salary, bonus, commissions and other incentive arrangements, we believe this was the most appropriate and comprehensive methodology for capturing the many different compensation arrangements we offer. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all of our employees included in the calculation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. We annualized the compensation of employees that we hired in 2018, who were not employed for the full year, by dividing their 2017 W-2 Box 5, Medicare Wages, by (a) the number of regular hours they worked in 2018, plus (b) the number of overtime hours they worked in 2018 times 1.5, and then multiplied the result by their full-time or part-time standard annual hours.  We annualized compensation for part-time employees without making a full-time equivalent adjustment for part-time employees. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4. Since all of our employees are located in the United States, as is our Chief Executive Officer, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying our "median employee." 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5. Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $40,686. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6. With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. 
[END TABLE]
Director Compensation 
Effective May 1, 2018, the board of directors implemented changes to our director compensation program in light of the completion of the Talmer merger and integration and our ongoing growth, which has significantly increased our size and complexity and subjected us to enhanced regulatory requirements and scrutiny. We engaged Aon to perform a market analysis of director compensation for a financial institution of our size, compared to our 2018 peer group.  After reviewing this market analysis, the Committee determined that to enable it to continue to retain and recruit qualified directors, it was in our best interest to revise the board of director compensation program, as follows.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual cash retainer was increased from $45,000 to $50,000. 
• The annual equity retainer value was increased from a grant date fair value of $45,000 to a grant date fair value of $80,813.  
• Certain Committee service stipends were amended to bring more consistency to the Committee service component of our director pay program. 
[END TABLE]
 The following terms represent the structure of our director compensation program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Effective prior to May 1, 2018   Effective May 1, 2018 
Annual Cash Retainer $45,000   $50,000

[END TABLE]
For 2018, non-employee directors were required to elect the form of delivery of their cash retainers from three alternatives: (1) Directors' Deferred Stock Plan (DDSP) units, (2) cash, or (3) a combination of DDPS units and cash.  Mr. Klein, Ms. Mahone and Mr. Wheatlake elected to receive all cash retainers in the form of cash. Mr. Pelizzari elected to receive his committee service retainers in the form of DDSP units, but other retainers in cash. The other non-employee directors elected to receive their both their annual cash retainers and committee service retainers in the form of DDSP units.
Our directors who are employees are not entitled to any additional compensation related to their service as a director. For 2018, this included Mr. Provost, Mr. Shafer and Mr. Torgow.
On April 21, 2008, the shareholders approved the Chemical Financial Corporation Directors' Deferred Stock Plan (DDSP), authorizing the issuance of up to 400,000 shares of our common stock. The DDSP provides benefits to our non-employee directors in the form of an equity retainer that is required to be deferred annually and invested in stock units representing shares of our common stock. The DDSP allows each non-employee director to voluntarily defer their annual cash retainer and/or all director and/or community advisory director fees and invest these retainers in stock units representing shares of our common stock. The amount of the annual cash and equity retainers in addition to the director committee service fees contributed to the DDSP are vested immediately. The deferral election must be made before the beginning of a plan year. The DDSP is an unfunded supplemental nonqualified deferred compensation plan that complies with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.
The equity retainer and any cash retainer voluntarily contributed to the DDSP are converted to stock units on the date paid. Any director fees that are voluntarily contributed to the DDSP are converted to stock units on the date we pay our next quarterly cash dividend. The number of stock units credited to each participating director's account is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the equity retainer and any deferred cash retainer by the market value of a single share of our common stock on the date the annual retainer is paid, and by dividing the dollar amount of any deferred director fees by the market value of a single share of our common stock on the next quarterly cash dividend payment date. Each participating director's account is also credited with dividend equivalents on each date we pay cash dividends. Dividend equivalents are a number of stock units equal to the number of shares of common stock that have a market value equal to the amount of any cash dividends that would have been paid to a shareholder owning the number of shares of common stock represented by stock units in a participating director's account on each cash dividend payment date.
Distributions will be made in our common stock equal to the number of stock units in the participating director's account. Any fractional shares will be paid in cash. Distributions will not be made until a director retires or terminates service as a director or upon the death of the director or a change in control of the Corporation. For common stock issued upon a director's retirement from or termination of service, the director has a choice to receive the shares in a lump-sum or in five annual installments. A director must make an irrevocable election between the lump-sum and five annual installments at the time the director begins participating in the DDSP. The election is irrevocable and applies to all future deferral elections. Upon a change in control (as defined in the DDPS) or death of the director, shares will be issued in a lump-sum. We may also permit a distribution to a participating director due to an unforeseeable emergency. Mr. Fitterling, Mr. Lievense, Ms. McQuade, Mr. Pelizzari, Mr. Stauffer, Mr. Tate and Mr. Weiss made voluntary contributions to the DDSP during 2018.

[END TABLE]
 Other Matters 
Transactions with Related Persons
Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons
Transactions by us with related parties are subject to review by our audit committee, as well as regulatory requirements and restrictions. These requirements and restrictions include Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which govern certain transactions by us with our affiliates) and the Federal Reserve's Regulation O (which governs certain loans by us to our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders). We have also adopted policies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions. In addition, our Audit Committee reviews and approves all transactions between Chemical and related persons which are required to be reported under SEC Regulation S-K, Item 404.
Geld Capital, LLC
Chemical Bank entered into an independent contractor agreement, effective July 1, 2018, with Geld Capital, LLC, which is principally owned by one of our directors, Richard Lievense. Under the agreement, Geld Capital, LLC will provide certain services to Insite Capital, LLC, a subsidiary of Chemical, for a fee of $40,000 per calendar quarter, during the term of the agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will terminate on September 30, 2019.
28 Associates LLC
Chemical Bank, currently headquartered in downtown Detroit, previously announced its planned expansion in the city, including approximately 500 jobs to be located there once it moves into a new headquarters building. On March 27, 2019, Chemical Bank and 28 Associates LLC, a Michigan limited liability company, entered into a letter agreement regarding the development and lease of a new headquarters building for Chemical Bank in Detroit. The parties have been in negotiations with respect to this property owned by 28 Associates since the third quarter of 2018. The development of this property on a high-profile lot located directly in the heart of Detroit's entertainment and commercial district, will be one of the first commercial high-rise buildings to be constructed in Detroit in decades. This project is a fundamental component of Chemical's commitment to participate in the revitalization of the City of Detroit and capitalize as a commercial bank on its strategic effort to be Detroit's "Hometown Bank," and build crucial deposit and loan relationships with key commercial and municipal customers in the market, including the City of Detroit. Chemical Bank remains fully committed to this effort. 28 Associates is 50% owned by the five adult children of Chemical's Chairman, Gary Torgow, through their ownership of a member of 28 Associates, Park Elizabeth Associates LLC. The members of Park Elizabeth Associates are Elie Torgow, Yoni Torgow, Rachel H. Torgow Krakauer, Moshe Torgow, and Jacob Torgow. Mr. Torgow recused himself from all Board deliberations related to this agreement, and none of these adult children are directors, officers or employees of Chemical or Chemical Bank. The Audit Committee of the Board (of which Mr. Torgow is not a member) also approved this letter agreement. Elie Torgow is also the manager of 28 Associates and owns less than .01% of Chemical. The approximate aggregate value of the interest of Mr. Torgow's children in the development and lease transaction is equal to approximately 50% of the amounts payable to 28 Associates thereunder. The letter agreement provides for the parties to enter into a development and lease transaction to include a triple net lease by Chemical of a proposed office building at the initial rate of $35 per rentable square foot for office space, or approximately $6,977,950 annually, and $50 per rentable square foot for retail space, or approximately $190,050 annually, with two percent annual increases during the initial term. The lease will have a term of 22.5 years and a rent commencement date of January 1, 2022. Chemical Bank has four renewal options of 84 months for each renewal option. The leased property will be approximately 421,481 square feet of gross area comprised of (a) a 203,171 square-foot building containing approximately (i) 199,370 square feet of rentable office space and (ii) 3,801 rentable square feet of 1st floor retail space, and (b) a parking garage and related parking facilities, including without limitation, 311 parking spaces. The four renewal terms will be at 95% fair market rental, with two percent annual increases, provided the base rent during each renewal term shall not be less than the immediately preceding lease year before commencement of each renewal term. 28 Associates, which owns the property, will remediate and improve the property and build the office building. Chemical Bank and 28 Associates have agreed to cooperate to seek critical tax incentives from governmental agencies, which will be for the benefit of the developer and Chemical Bank. Conditions to closing include receipt of tax incentives as well as guaranteed construction cost agreements on terms acceptable to the landlord and the tenant. Chemical Bank will lease the 311 parking spaces within the premises at an estimated monthly cost of $300 per spot, or $1,119,600 annually, provided that up to 60 parking spaces may be subleased back by 28 Associates for the same amount, reducing the net leased parking spaces to 251, or by $216,000 annually. Chemical Bank will also retain all parking rental income realized at the property from event parking rental services. If the parties do not enter into a final lease agreement with respect to the property, or if the parties do not receive the contemplated tax incentives by September 30, 2019, Chemical Bank has agreed to pay 28 Associates a break-up fee of $6 million, as 28 Associates has held the property off of the market since the third quarter of 2018, commenced the termination of tenants in an existing building on the site and incurred expenses associated with site preparation and negotiations as Chemical Bank has completed its due diligence. Other relationships
Directors, officers, principal shareholders and their associates and family members were customers of, and had transactions (including loans and loan commitments) with, Chemical Bank in the ordinary course of business during 2018. All such loans and commitments were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to Chemical and did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. Similar transactions may be expected to take place in the ordinary course of business in the future. None of these loan relationships presently in effect were disclosed as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problems as of the date of this proxy statement. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and certain officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock with the SEC. SEC regulations require such persons to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required for those persons, we believe that all applicable Section 16(a) reporting and filing requirements were satisfied on a timely basis by such persons from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. 
Shareholder Proposals 
A shareholder seeking to present a proposal at our annual meeting of shareholders must submit a notice to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with our bylaws not less than 120 calendar days prior to the date corresponding to the date of our proxy statement or notice of meeting released to shareholders in connection with the last preceding annual meeting of shareholders, in the case of an annual meeting (unless we did not hold an annual meeting within the last year, or if the date of the upcoming annual meeting changed by more than 30 days from the date of the last preceding meeting, then the notice must be delivered or mailed and received not more than 10 days after the earlier of the date of the notice of the meeting or public disclosure of the date of the meeting), and not more than ten days after the earlier of the date of the notice of the meeting or public disclosure of the date of the meeting, in the case of a special meeting. A shareholder seeking to include a proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to a meeting of shareholders must submit the proposal to us in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8. With respect to our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, the deadline to submit a notice of a proposal and to include a proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the meeting is November 27, 2019.
A shareholder seeking to nominate an individual for election as a director of Chemical must submit a notice to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws not less than 120 days prior to the date of the meeting, in the case of an annual meeting, and not more than seven days following the date of notice of the meeting, in the case of a special meeting. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
Our directors, officers and employees and our affiliates will initially solicit proxies by mail and over the Internet. They also may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means, but they will not receive any additional compensation for these efforts. Nominees, trustees and other fiduciaries who hold stock on behalf of beneficial owners of our common stock may communicate with the beneficial owners by mail or otherwise and may forward proxy materials to and solicit proxies from the beneficial owners. We will pay all costs of solicitation of proxies. We will also solicit proxies by telephone and the Internet. See the enclosed proxy for instructions.  Important Notice Regarding Delivery of Shareholder Documents

[BEGIN TABLE]
4.4 Adjustments. 
[END TABLE]
(a)    Stock Dividends and Distributions.  If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding changes by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or other general distribution of Common Stock or other securities 
A- 5
to holders of Common Stock, the number and kind of securities subject to outstanding Equity-Based Awards and available for issuance under the Plan, together with applicable exercise prices and the limitations provided in Section 4.3, shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as shall be equitable under the circumstances, as determined by the Committee.
(b)    Other Actions Affecting Common Stock.  If there occurs, other than as described in Section 4.4(a), any merger, business combination, recapitalization, reclassification, subdivision or combination approved by the Board that would result in the persons who were shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the effective time of any such transaction owning or holding, in lieu of or in addition to shares of Common Stock, other securities, money and/or property (or the right to receive other securities, money and/or property) immediately after the effective time of such transaction, then the outstanding Equity-Based Awards (including exercise prices) and reserves for Equity-Based Awards under the Plan shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as shall be equitable under the circumstances, as determined by the Committee.  It is intended that in the event of any such transaction, Equity-Based Awards under the Plan shall entitle the holder of each Equity-Based Award to receive (upon exercise in the case of Stock Options), in lieu of or in addition to shares of Common Stock, any other securities, money and/or property receivable upon consummation of any such transaction by holders of Common Stock with respect to each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of such transaction; upon any such adjustment, holders of Equity-Based Awards under the Plan shall have only the right to receive in lieu of or in addition to shares of Common Stock such other securities, money and/or other property as provided by the adjustment.
(c)    No Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares shall be issued pursuant to the Plan.  Any fractional shares resulting under the terms of the Plan, including but not limited to, due to adjustments under Section 4.4, partial vesting or tax withholding, shall be rounded up or down as determined in the Committee's discretion and no cash payment shall be made in lieu of the fractional share.
SECTION 5
Stock Options
5.1    Grant.  A Participant may be granted one or more Stock Options under the Plan. No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of stock subject to Stock Options granted hereunder until such shares have been issued.  For purposes of determining the number of shares available under the Plan, each Stock Option shall count as the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock Option.  Stock Options shall be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In addition, the Committee may vary, among Participants and among Stock Options granted to the same Participant, any and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Options granted under the Plan.  Subject to the limitation imposed by Section 4.3 of the Plan, the Committee shall have complete discretion in determining the number of Stock Options granted to each Participant.  Stock Options issued under the Plan shall be nonqualified stock options and shall not be considered incentive stock options as defined in Section 422(b) of the Code. The date of grant of a Stock Option shall be the date the Stock Option is authorized by the Committee or a future date specified by the Committee as the date for issuing the Stock Option.
5.2    Stock Option Agreements.  Stock Options shall be evidenced by stock option agreements, certificates of award, or both, containing the terms and conditions applicable to such Stock Options.  To the extent not covered by a stock option agreement or certificate of award, the terms and conditions of this Section 5 shall govern.
5.3    Stock Option Exercise Price.  The per share Stock Option exercise price shall be determined by the Committee, but shall be a price that is equal to or greater than 100% of the Market Value per share on the date of grant.
5.4    Medium and Time of Payment.  The exercise price for each share purchased pursuant to a Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be payable in cash or, if the Committee consents or provides in the applicable stock option agreement or grant, in shares of Common Stock (for the avoidance for doubt, including by the Participant instructing the Company to withhold a number of shares of Common Stock having a Market Value on the date the applicable Stock Option is exercised equal to the product of (a) the exercise price multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Common Stock in respect of which the Stock Option is being exercised). Broker-assisted cashless exercise of Stock Options is permitted under the Plan, provided that it is effectuated in a manner that does not violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other laws, rules or regulations.  The time and terms of payment may be amended with the consent of a Participant before or after exercise of a Stock Option, provided that such amendment would not cause a Stock Option to become subject to Section 409A of the Code.  Except as limited by the Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other laws, rules or regulations, the Committee may from time to time authorize payment of all or a portion of the Stock Option exercise price in the form of a promissory note or other deferred payment installments according to such terms as the 
A- 6
Committee may approve; provided, however, that such promissory note or other deferred payment installments shall be with full recourse and shall bear a market rate of interest.  The Board may restrict or suspend the power of the Committee to permit such loans and may require that adequate security be provided. 
5.5    Limits on Exercisability.  Stock Options shall be exercisable for such periods, not to exceed 10 years and one day from the date of grant, as may be fixed by the Committee.  At the time of exercise of a Stock Option, the holder of the Stock Option, if requested by the Committee, must represent to the Company that the shares are being acquired for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof.  The Committee may in its discretion require a Participant to continue the Participant's service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for a certain length of time prior to a Stock Option becoming exercisable and may eliminate such delayed vesting provisions.
5.6    Termination of Employment or Cessation of Service.  Unless otherwise specified in a Participant's Equity-Based Award Agreement or Individual Agreement: 
(a)    General.  If a Participant ceases to be a Director or ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiary for any reason, the Participant's outstanding Stock Options that have not vested by the date of Termination or Cessation shall be forfeited.  If a Participant ceases to be a Director or is no longer employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiary for any reason other than the Participant's Retirement, death, Disability or Termination for Cause, the Participant may exercise his or her Stock Options in accordance with their terms for a period not exceeding the earlier of the expiration of the Stock Options by their terms and three months after such Termination of employment or Cessation of service as a Director, but only to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise the Stock Options on the date of Termination.
(b)    Death.  If a Participant dies either while an Employee or Director otherwise during a time when the Participant could have exercised a Stock Option, the Stock Options issued to such Participant shall be exercisable in accordance with their terms by the personal representative of such Participant or other successor to the interest of the Participant for a period of one year after such Participant's death to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise the Stock Options on the date of death or Termination or Cessation, whichever first occurred, but not beyond the original term of the Stock Options.
(c)    Disability.  If a Participant ceases to be a Director or ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries due to the Participant's Disability, he or she may exercise his or her Stock Options in accordance with their terms for one year after he or she ceases to be a Director or employed unless such Stock Options earlier expire by their terms, but only to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise the Stock Options on the date of such event and not beyond the original terms of the Stock Options.
(d)    Participant Retirement.  If a Participant no longer serves as a Director or ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries due to Retirement, the Participant may exercise his or her Stock Options in accordance with their terms for three years after such Termination of employment or Cessation of service unless such Stock Options earlier expire by their terms.

SECTION 6
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
6.1    Grant.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Plan, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Participants under the Plan. Shares of Restricted Stock are shares of Common Stock the retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject, during specified periods of time, to such conditions (including continued employment, service as a Director and/or achievement of performance goals established by the Committee) and terms as the Committee deems appropriate.  Restricted Stock Units are Equity-Based Awards denominated in units of Common Stock under which the issuance of shares of Common Stock is subject to such conditions (including continued employment, service as a Director and/or achievement of performance goals established by the Committee) and terms as the Committee deems appropriate.  For purposes of determining the number of shares available under the Plan, each Restricted Stock Unit shall count as the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Unit.  Unless determined otherwise by the Committee, each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to one share of Common Stock and shall entitle a Participant to either shares of Common Stock or an 
A- 7
amount of cash determined with reference to the value of shares of Common Stock.  To the extent determined by the Committee, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may be satisfied or settled in cash, in shares of Common Stock or in a combination thereof.  Unless specified otherwise in an Equity-Based Award Agreement or other superseding agreement, Restricted Stock Units shall be settled within 30 days following satisfaction of the applicable vesting requirements, subject to any delay required by Section 409A of the Code.  Restricted Stock Units that are Performance-Based Compensation shall be settled no later than the 15th day of the third month after the Restricted Stock Units vest.  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan need not be identical but shall be consistent with the terms of the Plan.
6.2    Restricted Stock Agreements.  Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be evidenced by restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreements or certificates of award containing such terms and conditions, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall from time to time determine. Unless the restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement or certificate of award provides otherwise, awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6.
6.3    Vesting.  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and settlement of shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall occur at such time and in such installments as determined by the Committee or under criteria established by the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to make the timing of the grant and/or issuance of, the ability to retain and the vesting and/or the settlement of Restricted Stock Units and shares of Restricted Stock subject to continued employment, passage of time and/or such performance criteria as deemed appropriate by the Committee.
6.4    Termination of Employment or Cessation of Service.  Unless otherwise specified in a Participant's Equity-Based Award Agreement or Individual Agreement:
(a)    Voluntary Termination Other Than Retirement.  Other than as provided below upon Retirement, if a Participant voluntarily ceases to be an Employee, or if a Participant who is a Director voluntarily ceases to be a Director, for any reason during the Restricted Period, each share of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit still subject in full or in part to restrictions at the date of such Termination or Cessation shall automatically be forfeited and returned to the Company.
(b)    Death, Disability or Termination Without Cause.  In the event a Participant terminates his or her employment with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, or a Director ceases to be a Director, because of death, Disability or Termination without Cause during the Restricted Period, the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall lapse and such award shall vest on a prorated basis and be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the number of the Participant's shares of unvested Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units as of the effective date of the Termination, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (x) the number of full months that have elapsed since the later of the date of grant or the most recent annual vesting date and the effective date of Participant's Termination and (y) the total number of full months remaining in the vesting period since the later of the date of grant or the most recent annual vesting date. For Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are subject to attainment of performance goals, the number of a Participant's unvested Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are subject to proration as of the effective date of the Termination as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be the target (100%) number of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units set forth in the Equity-Based Award Agreement. All remaining shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and returned to the Company and all remaining Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited; provided, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the restrictions remaining on any or all of such remaining shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units either before or after the death, Disability or Termination without Cause of the Participant.
(c)    Retirement.  If a Participant who is a Director ceases providing services as a Director due to Retirement during the Restricted Period, then the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of Restricted Stock shall terminate automatically in full upon Retirement. In the event a Participant who is an Employee terminates his or her employment with the Company or any one of its Subsidiaries because of Retirement during the Restricted Period and the Participant has given the Company or its Subsidiary, as applicable, written notice of his or her intended date of Retirement at least one year in advance of such intended date of Retirement, the restrictions remaining on any or all shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall lapse and such award shall vest on a prorated basis and be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock in the manner described in Section 6.4(b) of the Plan. If the Participant does not provide such advance notice, then all remaining shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and returned to the Company and all remaining Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the restrictions remaining on any or all such remaining shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units either before or after the Retirement of the Participant.
A- 8

6.5    Legending of Restricted Stock.  In addition to any other legend that may be set forth on a Participant's share certificate, such certificates, if any, evidencing shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall bear the following legend:
The shares represented by this certificate were issued subject to certain restrictions under the Chemical Financial Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2019 (the "Plan"). This certificate is held subject to the terms and conditions in a restricted stock agreement that includes a prohibition against the sale or transfer of the stock represented by this certificate except in compliance with that agreement, which provides for forfeiture upon certain events.  Copies of the Plan and the restricted stock agreement are on file in the office of the Secretary of the Company. 
The Committee may require that certificates, if any, representing shares of Restricted Stock be retained and held in escrow by a designated employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary until any restrictions applicable to shares of Restricted Stock so retained have been satisfied or lapsed.
6.6    Rights as a Shareholder.  A Participant shall have all liquidation and other rights with respect to Restricted Stock held of record by such Participant as if the Participant held unrestricted Common Stock, subject to the restrictions regarding payment of dividends as set forth in Section 3.5; provided, that the unvested portion of any award of Restricted Stock shall be subject to any restrictions on transferability or risks of forfeiture imposed pursuant to this Section 6 and the terms and conditions set forth in the Participant's restricted stock agreement.  Unless the Committee otherwise determines or unless the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement or grant provide otherwise, a Participant shall have no dividend or liquidation rights with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to awards of Restricted Stock Units held by such Participant.
6.7    Voting Rights.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, Participants holding shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares during the Restricted Period. Participants shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Common Stock underlying Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares are reflected as issued and outstanding shares on the Company's stock ledger. 
SECTION 7
Stock-Based Awards
7.1    Grant.  Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Plan, in addition to any Stock Options, Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units that a Participant may be granted under the Plan, a Participant may be granted one or more other types of awards based on or related to shares of Common Stock (including the grant of Stock Awards).  Such awards shall be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be determined from time to time by the Committee in its sole discretion, and shall be evidenced by agreements or certificates of award containing such terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the shares of stock subject to Stock Awards shall be issued no later than the 15th day of the third month after the end of the calendar year in which the award is vested.  Such awards shall be expressed in terms of shares of Common Stock or denominated in units of Common Stock.  For purposes of determining the number of shares available under the Plan, each such unit shall count as the number of shares of Common Stock to which it relates. 
7.2    Rights as a Shareholder.
(a)    Stock Awards.  A Participant shall have all voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights with respect to vested shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant as a Stock Award under this Section 7 upon the Participant becoming the holder of record of the Common Stock granted pursuant to such Stock Award; provided, that the Committee may impose such restrictions on the assignment or transfer of Common Stock awarded pursuant to a Stock Award as it considers appropriate.  Any dividend payment with respect to a vested Stock Award shall be made no later than the 15th day of the third month following the date the dividends are paid to shareholders. 
(b)    General.  With respect to shares of Common Stock subject to awards granted under the Plan other than Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Awards, a Participant shall have such rights as 
A- 9
determined by the Committee and set forth in the respective award agreements; and the Committee may impose such restrictions on the assignment or transfer of Common Stock awarded pursuant to such awards as it considers appropriate.
SECTION 8
Change in Control
Unless otherwise specified in a Participant's Equity-Based Award Agreement or Individual Agreement, upon and following a Change in Control the following terms shall apply to all Equity-Based Awards granted under the Plan.
8.1    Continued Vesting of Equity-Based Awards. Following a Change in Control, all Equity-Based Awards granted under the Plan that are outstanding at the time of the Change in Control and have not previously vested shall continue to vest in accordance with the vesting provisions and Restricted Period in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 8. Following a Change in Control, and after giving effect to the provisions of this Section 8, a Participant's rights in respect of Retirement, death and Disability as set forth in the Plan, including any prorated vesting of unvested Equity-Based Awards, shall continue to apply.
8.2    Settlement of Performance-Based Equity-Based Awards. With respect to Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan that remain subject to the attainment of Performance Measures for which performance results have not been measured in the ordinary course prior to such Change in Control, upon the effective date of a Change in Control, the number of shares subject to the applicable Equity-Based Award Agreement from and after the date of the consummation of the Change in Control be equal to the greater of (a) the target (100% payout) number of shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units set forth in the applicable Equity-Based Award Agreement, and (b) the number of shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that would have been earned based on the actual performance of the Company measured through the latest practicable date prior to the effective date of the Change in Control (which, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, shall be the most recently completed calendar quarter) (such higher number, the "Earned Performance-Based Awards"). All remaining shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and returned to the Company, and all remaining Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited. Following the date of consummation of the Change in Control, the Earned Performance-Based Awards shall vest and be subject to forfeiture based on a Participant's continued service through the last day of the Performance Period.  
8.3    Conversion of Equity-Based Awards if Not the Surviving Entity.  If the Company is not the surviving entity following the effective date of a Change in Control, all outstanding and unvested shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall (after giving effect to Section 8.2 of the Plan, to the extent applicable) be converted into Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units of the surviving entity's common stock at the applicable exchange ratio on the date of the Change in Control (or shall be otherwise adjusted as contemplated by Section 4.4(b) of the Plan) in a manner approved by the Board. The value of all outstanding Stock Options shall be converted to a cash amount (which shall be received upon exercise, in lieu of shares of Common Stock or other securities or consideration) equal to the greater of the excess of (a) the highest sales price of the Company's Common Stock on Nasdaq on the date immediately prior to the effective date of such Change in Control of the Company or (b) the highest price per share actually paid in by the acquirer in connection with any Change in Control of the Company, over the exercise price per share of such Stock Options. Such amount shall remain subject to the vesting schedule of the applicable Stock Option and shall be paid in cash (without interest) when the applicable Stock Option otherwise would have vested in accordance with the applicable Equity-Based Award Agreement.  
8.4    Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. If, during the two-year period following the effective date of a Change in Control, a Participant's employment with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated without Cause or a Participant terminates such employment for Good Reason, all unvested Equity-Based Awards granted to the Participant under the Plan shall vest in full on the Termination date of the Participant, subject to the settlement determination and conversion provisions set forth in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 of the Plan.  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall be converted into shares of Common Stock (or the common stock of the surviving entity, as applicable) and shall be issued to the Participant within thirty (30) days following the Participant's Termination date, subject to any required delay pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  Stock Options that vest pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall be exercisable for the full remaining term of the Stock Options as set forth in the applicable Equity-Based Award Agreements.

9.3    Committee Discretion.  In the event of changes to applicable tax laws, securities laws and accounting principles, in addition to its authority under Section 9.2, the Committee may alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining shareholder approval of such changes. 
9.4    Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation.  Equity-Based Awards that are designed to be Performance-Based Compensation pursuant to Section 9 of the Plan may not be increased or adjusted upward.  The Committee shall retain the discretion to decrease or adjust such Equity-Based Awards downward, and such Equity-Based Awards may be forfeited in whole or in part. 
9.5    Performance-Based Compensation Conditioned on Performance.  Payment of Performance-Based Compensation to a Participant for a Performance Period under this Plan shall be entirely contingent upon achievement of the performance goals established by the Committee pursuant to this Section 9, the satisfaction of which must be substantially uncertain when established by the Committee for the Performance Period.
9.6    Time of Determination of Performance Goals by Committee.  All performance goals to be made by the Committee for a Performance Period pursuant to this Section 9 shall be established in writing by the Committee during the first 90 days of such Performance Period and before 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed.
9.7    Objective Standards.  Performance-Based Compensation shall be based solely upon objective criteria, consistent with this Section 9, from which an independent third party with knowledge of the facts could determine whether the performance goal or range of goals is met and from that determination could calculate the Performance-Based Compensation to be paid.  Although the Committee has authority to exercise reasonable discretion to interpret this Plan and the criteria it shall specify pursuant to this Section 9 of the Plan, it may not amend or waive such criteria after the 90th day of the respective Performance Period with respect to an Equity-Based Award intended to be Performance-Based Compensation.  The Committee shall have no authority or discretion to increase any Performance-Based Compensation or to construct, modify or apply the measurement of a Participant's Performance in a manner that will directly or indirectly increase the Performance-Based Compensation for the Participant for any Performance Period above the amount determined by the applicable objective standards established within the time period set forth in Section 9.6.
SECTION 10
General Provisions
10.1    Restrictions on Transferability; Clawback and Recoupment. 
(a)    General. Unless the Committee otherwise consents or permits (before or after the Equity-Based Award is made) or unless the Equity-Based Award Agreement provides otherwise, Equity-Based Awards granted under the Plan may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, as a condition to any transfer permitted by the Committee or the terms of the award agreement, the transferee must execute a written agreement permitting the Company to satisfy any federal, state or local withholding or other taxes associated with or resulting from the exercise or vesting of any Equity-Based Award in any manner provided for in Section 10.3.  All provisions of an Equity-Based Award that are determined with reference to the Participant, including without limitation those that refer to the Participant's employment or service as a Director with the Company or any one of its Subsidiaries, shall continue to be determined with reference to the Participant after any transfer of an Equity-Based Award. All rights with respect to Equity-Based Awards granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by such Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative.
(b)    Other Restrictions. The Committee may impose other restrictions on any Equity-Based Award or shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise or settlement of an Equity-Based Award under the Plan as the Committee deems advisable, including, without limitation, holding periods or further transfer restrictions, forfeiture provisions, and restrictions under applicable federal or state securities laws.
(c)    Clawback and Recoupment. Equity-Based Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the Company's "clawback" policy for the recovery and recoupment of incentive compensation, as it may be amended from time to time.
10.2    No Rights to Equity-Based Awards.  No Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Equity-Based Award under the Plan and there is no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Equity-Based Awards under the Plan.  The terms and conditions of Equity-Based Awards of the same type and the determination 
A- 12
of the Committee to grant a waiver or modification of any Equity-Based Award and the terms and conditions thereof need not be the same with respect to each Participant or the same Participant.
10.3    Withholding.  The Company or a Subsidiary shall be entitled to:  (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of a Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to a Participant from the Company or a Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, state, local and foreign withholding and employment-related tax requirements attributable to an Equity-Based Award, including, without limitation, the grant, exercise or vesting of, or payment of dividends with respect to, an Equity-Based Award; or (b) require a Participant promptly to remit the amount of such withholding to the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, before taking any action with respect to an Equity-Based Award.  Unless the Committee determines otherwise, withholding may be satisfied by withholding Common Stock to be received upon exercise or vesting of an Equity-Based Award or by delivery to the Company of previously owned Common Stock.  The Company and any Subsidiary may establish such rules and procedures concerning timing of any withholding election as it deems appropriate.
10.4    Compliance With Laws; Listing and Registration of Shares.  All Equity-Based Awards granted under the Plan (and all issuances of Common Stock or other securities under the Plan) shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to the requirement that if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of such Equity-Based Award or the issuance or purchase of shares thereunder, such Equity-Based Award may not be exercised in whole or in part, or the restrictions on such Equity-Based Award shall not lapse, unless and until such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
10.5    No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, including the grant of Stock Options and other stock-based and stock-related awards, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
10.6    No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Equity-Based Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary.  The Company or any Subsidiary may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or service, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any written agreement with the Participant.
10.7    No Liability of Company.  Neither the Company, any Subsidiary, Affiliate, Employee nor Director shall be liable to a Participant or any other person as to:  (a) the non-issuance or non-sale of Common Stock as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder; (b) any tax consequence to any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Equity-Based Award granted hereunder, including but not limited to any tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code; and (c) any provision of law or legal restriction that prohibits or restricts the transfer of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to any Equity-Based Award. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.7 shall apply to any Subsidiary or Affiliate in existence or hereafter comes into existence.
10.8    Suspension of Rights under Equity-Based Awards.  The Company, by written notice to a Participant, may suspend a Participant's and any transferee's rights under any Equity-Based Award for a period not to exceed 60 days while the Termination for Cause of that Participant's employment or service with the Company and its Subsidiaries is under consideration.
10.9    Governing Law.  The validity, construction and effect of the Plan and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and applicable federal law.
10.10    Severability.  In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included, unless such construction would cause the Plan to fail in its essential purposes.
10.11    Compliance with 409A.  The Plan and Equity Based Awards granted hereunder are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or an exemption or exclusion therefrom, and, with respect to any Equity Based Awards that constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Plan,  Equity Based Award Agreements and any Individual Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in all respects in accordance with Section 409A of the Code (including with respect to the application of any defined terms with respect to Equity Based Award Agreements that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation, which defined terms shall be interpreted to have the meaning required by Section 409A of 
A- 13
the Code to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code). Each payment (including the delivery of shares of Common Stock) under any Equity Based Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and, to the extent to be made or delivered upon a termination of employment or cessation of service may only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Code to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of penalty taxes on a Participant pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. In no event may a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Plan that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company as in effect on the date of a Participant's separation from service), Equity Based Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be deliverable by reason of a Participant's separation from service during the six-month period immediately following such separation from service shall instead be provided on the earlier to occur of: (a) the date that is six months and one day after such Participant's separation from service; or (b) the date of such Participant's death. 
SECTION 11
Termination and Amendment
11.1    Board and Committee Actions.   The Board may terminate the Plan at any time or may from time to time amend or alter the Plan or any aspect of it as it considers proper and in the best interests of the Company; provided, that no such amendment may be made, without the approval of shareholders of the Company, that would (i) reduce the exercise price at which Stock Options may be granted below the price provided for in Section 5.3, (ii) reduce the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options, or (iii) otherwise amend the Plan in any manner requiring shareholder approval by law or under NASDAQ listing requirements or other applicable NASDAQ rules.
11.2    No Impairment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 11.1, no such amendment or alteration to the Plan or to any previously granted award agreement or Equity-Based Award shall be made which would impair the rights of the holder of the Equity-Based Award, without such holder's consent; provided, that no such consent shall be required if the Committee determines in its sole discretion and prior to the date of any Change in Control that such amendment or alteration is required or advisable in order for the Company, the Plan or the Equity-Based Award to satisfy any law or regulation or to meet the requirements of or avoid adverse financial accounting consequences under any tax or accounting standard, law or regulation. 
SECTION 12
Effective Date and Duration of the Plan
The Plan shall take effect May 7, 2019, subject to approval by the shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment thereof or at a Special Meeting of Shareholders.  Unless earlier terminated by the Board, no Equity-Based Award shall be granted under the Plan after May 7, 2029.
