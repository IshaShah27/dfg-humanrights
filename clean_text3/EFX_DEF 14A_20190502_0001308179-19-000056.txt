Dear Fellow Shareholder:
First and foremost, I want to thank you for your continued investment in Equifax. The past year has been one of the most important in our company's history. Your Board of Directors and management team have been intensely focused on implementing meaningful changes to our data security systems, technology platforms and risk management processes, in an effort to strengthen our culture, underpin our business strategy and rebuild our relationships with consumers, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
As part of this transformational journey, we made important changes to our leadership team. We appointed Mark Begor as Chief Executive Officer to lead our company on the path back to growth and market leadership. Mark has established a "tone at the top" for the organization, which prioritizes data security and risk management while maintaining a vital focus on consumers and our customers. We also hired experienced leaders to fill key roles, including our Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Technology Officer, President of U.S. Information Solutions and Senior Vice President of Enterprise Risk and Compliance.
At the Board level, we remain committed to robust governance and responsible oversight. Following our 2018 Annual Meeting, we evaluated the voting results and took a number of actions designed to further enhance the effectiveness of our oversight. Among other things, we refreshed the composition of our Audit and Technology Committees, increased the Board's exposure to, and participation in, security training and crisis management planning, and oversaw an annual third party assessment of our security program. Most recently, we appointed Heather Wilson, Chief Data Scientist of L Brands, Inc., to our Board and Technology Committee. Heather brings expertise in data, analytics and risk management; these core competencies closely align with our business strategy and its associated risks.
In my role as Independent Chairman, I have continued to engage directly with our shareholders in an effort to be transparent about our continued progress and actions taken following the 2017 cybersecurity incident. During the past year, we conducted one-on-one engagement with holders of approximately 57% of our outstanding shares.
Our interactions with investors have provided us with valuable feedback on Board composition, risk management, human capital management, corporate governance and executive compensation, among other topics. We value our shareholders and will continue to evaluate and integrate investor feedback into our Board discussions and business decisions.
On behalf of the Board, I invite you to attend our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be held on May 2, 2019 at 9:30 a.m., Central Time, at our Equifax Workforce Solutions headquarters located at 11432 Lackland Road, St. Louis, Missouri, 63146. A notice of the meeting and our 2019 Proxy Statement containing important information about the matters to be voted upon and instructions on how to vote your shares follow this letter.

Compensation Program Highlights and Key Changes for 2018 and 2019
Executive Compensation Philosophy
Compensation Program Changes
In late 2017 and early 2018, the Compensation Committee undertook a comprehensive review of our short- and long-term incentive compensation program and considered shareholder feedback when it made changes to the 2018 program. In February 2019, in connection with our recently-announced business transformation strategy, the Committee made changes to our long-term incentive program. The changes for 2018 and 2019 are outlined below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Adopted      Change In Control Severance Plan• In          February 2019, the Committee adopted a new Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan") for senior executives,          including our NEOs other than Mr. Begor. The Committee worked with its outside compensation consultant to design a plan with market-standard          terms that will provide executives security in the event of a change in control of the Company. The CIC Plan ensures that our executives          objectively evaluate potential transactions that may be in the best interest of our shareholders, despite the potential negative          consequences such transactions may have on them personally. The CIC Plan will not apply to Mr. Begor, whose change in control protections          as contained in his employment agreement were already aligned with the core provisions of the CIC Plan.   –  Eliminated          CIC Letter Agreements. Other than as described above with respect to our CEO, all of our executives with individual          change in control agreements (the "CIC Letter Agreements") agreed to give up their individual agreements and become          subject to the new CIC Plan.   –  Reduced          CIC Severance Multiples. Under the CIC Letter Agreements, certain executives were entitled to a severance multiple          of 3x. Following the elimination of the CIC Letter Agreements, the severance multiple upon a change in control was set at 2x for          all executives other than the CEO, representing a significant decrease in the benefit payable.   –  Eliminated          CIC Tax Gross-Ups. Under the CIC Letter Agreements, certain executives were entitled to tax gross-up benefits in          connection with a change in control. Following the elimination of the CIC Letter Agreements, we do not offer tax gross-up benefits          in connection with a change in control.

The CIC Plan ensures that our executives          objectively evaluate potential transactions that may be in the best interest of our shareholders, despite the potential negative          consequences such transactions may have on them personally. The CIC Plan will not apply to Mr. Begor, whose change in control protections          as contained in his employment agreement were already aligned with the core provisions of the CIC Plan.   –  Eliminated          CIC Letter Agreements. Other than as described above with respect to our CEO, all of our executives with individual          change in control agreements (the "CIC Letter Agreements") agreed to give up their individual agreements and become          subject to the new CIC Plan.   –  Reduced          CIC Severance Multiples. Under the CIC Letter Agreements, certain executives were entitled to a severance multiple          of 3x. Following the elimination of the CIC Letter Agreements, the severance multiple upon a change in control was set at 2x for          all executives other than the CEO, representing a significant decrease in the benefit payable.   –  Eliminated          CIC Tax Gross-Ups. Under the CIC Letter Agreements, certain executives were entitled to tax gross-up benefits in          connection with a change in control. Following the elimination of the CIC Letter Agreements, we do not offer tax gross-up benefits          in connection with a change in control.

Implemented      Changes to 2019 Direct Compensation• No          Increase in Base Salary or Annual Bonus Opportunity for NEOs. The Committee determined  that our NEOs will not receive any increase to base salary or target bonus opportunity for 2019. The only  compensation increases for our NEOs for 2019 relate to our long-term incentive program (described  below), which creates greater focus on stock price and multi-year performance and thereby enhances  alignment between management and shareholders.• 2019  Equifax Transformation Leadership Program. In connection with our EFX2020 multi-year business transformation strategy  (see page 5 for details), the Committee reformulated the long-term incentive program for 2019 to more closely align incentives  with our near- and long-term goals. The Equifax Transformation Leadership Program (the "2019 ETLP") increases the  target long-term incentive award opportunity for each NEO and a select group of our senior leadership team members, each of whom  is integral to the successful execution of our strategy. In conjunction with the increased opportunity, the degree of overall  performance risk has been substantially increased. The Committee expects to revert back to our traditional long-term incentive  structure in 2020. The 2019 ETLP is described in detail on pages 49-51.

Board Skills Matrix
The Board skills matrix below represents some of the key skills that our Board has identified as particularly valuable to the effective oversight of the Company and the execution of our strategy. This matrix highlights the depth and breadth of the skills of our directors standing for election.
BOARD LEADERSHIP & CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Equifax Corporate Governance
Our Board of Directors and management team are committed to achieving and maintaining high standards of corporate governance, ethics and integrity. We conduct our business in a manner that is socially responsible, value-based and in compliance with the law. We periodically review our governance policies and practices against evolving standards and make changes as appropriate. We also value the perspectives of our shareholders and other stakeholders, including our employees and the communities in which we operate, and take steps to implement their points of view when warranted.
Investor engagement over the last several years has prompted review of and changes to our governance practices, and our Board remains committed to continuous improvement. See "Corporate Governance Highlights" on pages 12-13 for a summary of our key governance practices. In addition, following our 2018 Annual Meeting, we conducted investor outreach meetings with shareholders representing approximately 57% of our shares. Our Independent Chairman, Mark Feidler, participated in one-on-one investor meetings, during which we discussed a number of business and governance-related topics, including Board refreshment and skill sets, company culture and cultural changes, risk oversight, human capital management, executive compensation and corporate governance. Those conversations provided valuable insight that has informed the Board's decision-making on several of the improvements to our corporate governance described in this Proxy Statement.
The following sections summarize our corporate governance policies and practices including our Board leadership structure, our criteria for director selection and the responsibilities and activities of our Board and its committees. Our corporate governance documents, including the Governance Guidelines, our Board committee charters and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to directors, officers and employees, are available at https://www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance, or in print upon request to Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, telephone (404) 885-8000. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct provides our policies and expectations on a number of topics, including our commitment to good citizenship, providing transparency in our public disclosures, prohibiting insider trading, avoiding conflicts of interest, honoring the confidentiality of sensitive information, preservation and use of Company assets, compliance with all laws and operating with integrity in all that we do.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    19
Board Leadership Structure
The Board annually reviews its leadership structure, and our governance documents provide the Board with the flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for us at any given time. In prior years, the roles of Chairman and CEO were combined. However, after the 2017 cybersecurity incident, and simultaneous with the appointment of our interim CEO, the Board determined to adjust its leadership structure to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO. Mark Feidler, who had previously served as a leader for the independent directors in his role as Presiding Director, was elected to the role of Independent Chairman. The Board concluded that this new structure would allow our then-interim CEO to focus his attention on leading the Company's response to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and efforts to rebuild trust with shareholders, consumers, customers and other stakeholders.
In connection with the appointment of Mr. Begor as our CEO, the Board re-evaluated the leadership structure and determined to retain the current structure of separate Chairman and CEO roles, with Mr. Feidler continuing to serve as our Independent Chairman. This structure provides for direct independent oversight of management and clearly delineates the role of the Board as a source of insight and oversight for management. The Board believes this leadership structure, which also includes a majority independent Board and fully independent Board committees, best serves the objectives of the Board's independent oversight of the Company's business and affairs at this time.

The role and responsibilities of Independent Chairman include:
Annual Self-Evaluations
Our Board continually seeks to improve its performance. We have a rigorous annual Board and committee self-evaluation process, which presents the opportunity to examine the Board's effectiveness and practices and identify areas for improvement. Our Governance Committee annually reviews and recommends the specific format to use for that year's Board evaluation.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    20
Board Evaluation Process for 2018-2019
The Board periodically engages an independent consultant to facilitate its annual Board and committee self-evaluation process, as it did most recently in connection with the 2017-2018 review cycle. This year, based upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board determined it was appropriate to implement the standard process for the 2018-2019 evaluation process. Under the standard process, each director completed written Board and committee evaluation questionnaires. The questionnaire responses were then aggregated by the Office of Corporate Secretary without individual attribution and reviewed by the Independent Chairman as well as the committee chairs. The Independent Chairman then participated in one-on-one discussions with each of the other directors, during which they discussed the response summaries. The Independent Chairman reviewed the evaluation results with the full Board of Directors in February 2019. Following review, the Board and its committees identified various opportunities to strengthen the effectiveness of the Board's practices, structures, competencies and communications. For example, in response to feedback discussed as part of the Governance Committee self-evaluation, the Governance Committee identified an opportunity to enhance the new director orientation process by designating a member of the Board to participate in a one-on-one onboarding session with each new director.
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board has four standing committees, all of which are comprised of independent directors as defined in the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules. The Board appoints committees to help carry out its duties and work on key issues in greater detail than is generally possible at Board meetings. Committees regularly review the results of their meetings with the Board. In 2018, the full Board held 18 meetings and the standing committees held a total of 34 meetings.
Committee Composition
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    21
Committee Responsibilities
Each committee operates pursuant to a written charter which is available on the Company's website at www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance. The following summarizes the oversight responsibilities of each committee:
Director Independence
Our Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our Board should be independent. Our Guidelines for Determining the Independence of Directors, which may be accessed on our website at www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance, meet or exceed the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and regulations and the NYSE listing standards.
The Board has affirmatively determined that all director nominees (other than our CEO, Mr. Begor) are independent under the applicable NYSE listing standards, SEC rules and our Guidelines for Determining the Independence of Directors. In making these determinations, the Board considered the types and amounts of the commercial dealings between the Company and the companies and organizations with which the directors are affiliated. The Board views the independence analysis as an ongoing consideration and will continue to monitor these relationships.
Each director is an equal participant in decisions made by the full Board. All of our standing Committees are comprised solely of independent directors.

Board Refreshment and Succession Planning
The Governance Committee regularly assesses the requirements of the Board and makes recommendations regarding its size, composition and structure. The Governance Committee is focused on how the experience and skill set of each individual director complements those of fellow directors to create a balanced Board with diverse viewpoints, skills and expertise and reflecting a diversity of experiences, gender, ethnicity and age. As part of its ongoing strategic review regarding Board refreshment, the Governance Committee seeks to anticipate future needs for expertise in new and emerging markets, security, technology and regulatory compliance, while also enhancing the diversity on our Board. Among other things, the Governance Committee considers committee composition and chair rotation as part of its overall succession planning process.
Since the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the Governance Committee and the Board have actively sought new directors that can provide valuable guidance as the Company continues to focus on strengthening the Company's core technology and security competencies and executing on our EFX2020 multi-year business transformation strategy. The Board believes that the additions of Scott McGregor in October 2017, Robert Selander in March 2018 and Heather Wilson in February 2019 provide our Board with additional broad-based executive management experience, as well as enhanced expertise in security, technology, risk management, data and analytics.
Board Tenure and Refreshment
Pursuant to our Bylaws and Governance Guidelines, we have a mandatory retirement age of 72 (65 for employee-directors) after which a director will not be elected or re-elected unless he or she continues in a position or in business or professional activities or possesses special qualifications that the Governance Committee and Board determine would be of substantial benefit to the Company. The following table shows the tenure of our non-management directors, which is well distributed to create a balanced Board, with five new independent directors joining the Board over the last three years. Since 2013, we have decreased the average tenure of our independent director nominees from 10.4 years to 5.4 years. Individual and average tenure information for our Board (following election of the nine independent director nominees named in this Proxy Statement at the 2019 Annual Meeting) is as follows:

Committee Tenure and Refreshment
The Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the composition of committees of the Board. In its review of committee composition, the Governance Committee considers the responses collected during the Board and committee annual self-evaluations, as well as the past experience and relevant skills of each director. Since the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the Governance Committee and the Board have placed a renewed emphasis on refreshing the committees of the Board to ensure each committee has the appropriate relevant mix of skills and experience. Following the 2017 cybersecurity incident, each of the four standing committees of the Board is comprised of at least 50% of directors who were not members of such committee prior to September 2017. In particular, three of the four Technology Committee members joined the Board after September 2017. Individual tenure information for each committee is as follows:

Director Membership Criteria and Nomination Processes
Process for Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees
When the need to fill a new Board seat or vacancy arises, the Governance Committee proceeds in the manner it deems appropriate to identify a qualified candidate or candidates. Candidates may be identified through the engagement of an outside search firm, recommendations from independent directors, the Chairman of the Board, management or other advisors to the Company, and recommendations by shareholders. The Governance Committee Chair and Chairman of the Board are provided with copies of the resumes for any potential candidates so identified and review them as appropriate with the Governance Committee, our CEO and the full Board. Our most recent addition to the Board, Heather Wilson, was identified as a potential candidate by an outside search firm.
Our Governance Committee determines the selection criteria and qualifications for director nominees. As set forth in our Governance Guidelines, these criteria include, among other things, a director candidate's integrity and ethical standards, independence from management, the ability to provide sound and informed judgment, a history of achievement that reflects superior standards and willingness to commit sufficient time. With respect to the last three additions to the Board, the Governance Committee was also very focused on expertise in data security, risk management, data and analytics and information technology. Since 2018, cybersecurity is one of the skills that the Governance Committee considers in its assessment of Board membership criteria. The Governance Committee and the Board also consider whether the candidate is independent under the standards described under "Director Independence" on page 22 and whether the candidate is financially literate.
Although the Committee does not have a formal diversity policy for Board membership, it considers whether a director nominee contributes or will contribute to the Board in a way that can enhance the perspective and experience of the Board as a whole through, among other things, diversity in gender, age, ethnicity and professional experience. When current Board members are considered for nomination for re-election, the Committee also takes into consideration their prior Board contributions, performance and meeting attendance records. The effectiveness of the Board's skills, expertise and background, including its diversity, is also considered as part of the Board's annual self-assessment.
Directors are limited to service on four other public company boards, not including our Board. Audit Committee members may not serve on the audit committee of more than three public companies absent a Board determination that such service will not impair the ability of such member to serve effectively on the Company's Audit Committee. In addition, when our CEO is a member of our Board, he or she may not serve on more than two other public company boards.
Procedures for Shareholders to Recommend Director Nominees
The Governance Committee will consider for possible nomination qualified Board candidates that are submitted by our shareholders using the same process that applies to candidates identified by other sources. Shareholders wishing to make such a submission may do so by sending the following information to the Governance Committee by November 23, 2019, c/o Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302: (1) a nomination notice in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.12 of our Bylaws; (2) a request that the Governance Committee consider the shareholder's candidate for inclusion in the Board's slate of nominees for the applicable meeting; and (3) along with the shareholder's candidate, an undertaking to provide all other information the Committee or the Board may request in connection with their evaluation of the candidate. See "How do I submit a proposal or director nominee for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders?" on page 79. A copy of our Bylaws is available on our website at www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance or by writing to the Corporate Secretary.
Any shareholder's nominee must satisfy the minimum qualifications for any director described above in the judgment of the Governance Committee and the Board. In evaluating shareholder nominees, the Committee and the Board may consider all relevant information, including the factors described above, and additionally may consider the size and duration of the nominating shareholder's holdings in the Company; whether the nominee is independent of the nominating shareholder and able to represent the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole; and the interests and/or intentions of the nominating shareholder.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education
Upon joining our Board, directors participate in an orientation program regarding our Company, including business operations, strategy, regulation, governance and company policies. New for 2019, an existing member of our Board will be designated to participate in the orientation process and conduct a one-on-one session with each new director. In addition to the onboarding process, members of senior management regularly present reports at Board meetings and review the operating plan and strategy of each of our business units and the Company as a whole, as well as provide periodic training sessions regarding regulatory compliance and governance issues. The Board also conducts periodic visits to our key facilities and Board members participate in crisis management simulations and/or training with management. Board members also may attend outside director continuing education programs at Company expense to assist them in keeping pace with developments in corporate governance and other critical issues relating to the operations of public company boards. In 2018, the Board implemented enhanced Board-level engagement with respect to data security education and crisis management planning, including in connection with our new director orientation program.

Management Succession Planning and Talent Development Process
Our Board is accountable for the development, implementation and continual review of a succession plan for the CEO and other executive officers. As part of its responsibilities under its charter, the Compensation Committee oversees the succession planning process for the CEO and the senior leadership team. The process ensures that critical business capabilities are safeguarded, executive development is prioritized and strategic talent is leveraged to focus on current and new business imperatives. In light of the appointment of a new CEO last year, the Compensation Committee has undertaken refreshed succession and development plans, including continued practices such as monitoring each of the CEO's direct reports for high potential internal CEO succession candidates, all of whom have ongoing exposure to the Board and are reviewed annually with the Board by the CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer. The Compensation Committee and the Board also review the foregoing in executive session on a regular basis.
How We Manage Risk
We have a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management ("ERM") program focused on the application of controls over the following risk types:
In an effort to strengthen our ERM program, we have implemented an enterprise risk management framework based on the "three lines of defense" model for establishing effective checks and balances, which is used by leading financial institutions.
The implementation and execution of our ERM program is supervised by our Risk Office, with each business unit and corporate support unit having primary responsibility for assessing and mitigating risks within its respective areas of responsibility. Our recently-appointed SVP for Enterprise Risk and Compliance leads the Risk Office and meets regularly with the Board, the Audit Committee and the Technology Committee. An ERM team within the Risk Office develops, enhances, deploys and manages risk program elements.

Board Oversight of Risk
Our Board oversees risk management at the Company. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees.

Related Person Transaction Policy
The Board has adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between the Company and its directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% beneficial owners and their respective immediate family members (each, a "Related Person"), where the amount of the transaction is expected to exceed $120,000 in a single calendar year. The policy provides that the Audit Committee reviews transactions subject to the policy and decides whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, the Audit Committee determines whether the transaction is in the best interests of the Company. In making that determination, the Audit Committee takes into account the following, among other factors it deems appropriate:
The Governance Committee also determines the impact or potential impact on a director's independence in the event the Related Person is a director, an immediate family member of a director, or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer.
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions of Directors, Executive Officers and 5 Percent Shareholders
During 2018, the Company was not a participant in any transaction or series of transactions in which the amount involved did or may exceed $120,000 in which any Related Person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than the compensation arrangements (including with respect to equity compensation) described in "Executive Compensation" beginning on page 30 and "Director Compensation" on page 69.

Say-on-Pay Voting Results in 2018
In evaluating our executive compensation program, one factor our Compensation Committee considers is the results of the most recent annual shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation or "say-on-pay" vote. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 85% of the votes cast approved our executive compensation program. Following our 2018 Annual Meeting, the Committee continued to review our compensation program and practices and how effective each is in our ability to attract and retain talent. The Committee continues to take steps to ensure that pay opportunities are performance-based, with a mix of fixed and at-risk variable pay.
Shareholder Outreach and Engagement
As part of our ongoing shareholder engagement program, feedback received from shareholders on our executive compensation program is shared with the full Board and the Compensation Committee. The Committee considers this feedback in its review of our compensation program, as well as compensation plan and benchmarking advice from its independent compensation consultant.
Following the 2018 Annual Meeting, Independent Chairman Mark Feidler and members of management conducted investor outreach meetings with shareholders representing approximately 57% of our shares. During these one-on-one investor meetings, we discussed a number of business and governance-related topics, including risk management, human capital management and executive compensation.
Based on shareholder recommendations, we continue to enhance our proxy disclosures regarding changes to executive compensation programs. Going forward, the Company will maintain an active dialogue with shareholders and continue to evaluate and integrate feedback into Board discussions, including topics such as metrics that drive the NEOs' short and long-term incentive compensation.

Compensation Program Highlights and Key Changes for 2018 and 2019
Executive Compensation Philosophy
Compensation Program Changes
In late 2017 and early 2018, the Compensation Committee undertook a comprehensive review of our short- and long-term incentive compensation program and considered shareholder feedback when it made changes to the 2018 program. In February 2019, in connection with our recently-announced EFX2020 business transformation strategy, the Committee made changes to our long-term incentive program. The changes for 2018 and 2019 are outlined below:
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    33
2018 Target Pay Mix
As illustrated in the chart below, the Company emphasizes long-term equity awards and annual performance-based cash incentives so that a substantial portion of each executive's total compensation opportunity is linked directly to the Company's stock price or otherwise driven by performance (85% of total direct compensation for our CEO and an average of 68% for the other NEOs):

Role of the Compensation Committee, Management and Compensation Consultants in Determining Executive Compensation
For information on how the Compensation Committee works with management and independent compensation consultants in making executive pay decisions, see "Role of the Compensation Committee and Management in Determining Executive Compensation" on page 47 and "Compensation Consultant Services and Independence" on pages 47-48.
Compensation Elements and Objectives
Benchmarking Process and Use of a Peer Group
Peer Group Used for Compensation Purposes
We consider market pay practices and our relative size and performance versus peers when setting target pay opportunities for our executives, in addition to evaluations of individual performance. The Compensation Committee uses benchmarking as one of several inputs for decision-making with respect to setting competitive executive pay levels.
For 2018, we conducted a detailed market review of executive pay to evaluate each element of pay competitiveness, reviewed pay practices of our peers and the broader market, and compared performance against market data as described below. This analysis was discussed and reviewed by the Compensation Committee with its independent compensation consultant. Two primary types of market data were used to compile this analysis:
2018 Peer Group
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    35
The Compensation Committee selected this peer group in 2009 primarily based upon criteria such as companies against which we compete directly or indirectly for capital, executive talent and, in some cases, business. Because there were no publicly-held, stand-alone direct U.S. competitors across all of our businesses at the time, we focused on similarly complex companies that compete with us in a significant aspect of our business, have similar customers, or are in the business of data and analytics-based business solutions delivered through technology. Industries represented by these companies included information and delivery systems, publishing, specialized finance, information technology consulting services, data processing, outsourced services and application software.
2019 Peer Group
In September 2018, following review and based on the recommendations of its independent compensation consultant, the Committee revised its peer group to include the 17 publicly-held companies set forth below:
These companies were chosen because they are similarly-sized companies providing data and analytics-based business solutions through technology. The revenues of the companies in our new peer group range from 1/3x to 3x our revenue.
Peer Group for Performance Shares
The 2018 peer group described above was deemed appropriate for compensation purposes, but the stock performance of those companies does not necessarily adjust based on the same economic factors as ours. For that reason, the Committee believes that a broader peer group is more appropriate for evaluating TSR performance for performance shares issued under our LTI program. Therefore, the Compensation Committee uses the companies in the S&P 500 Index (of which we are a member) as the comparator group for that purpose.
Use of "Tally Sheets" and Wealth Accumulation Analysis
On a regular basis, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant prepares "tally sheets" relating to compensation of the NEOs. The tally sheets quantify the total compensation package, the impact of stock price change on the value of existing long-term incentives, the wealth created from prior equity grants and amounts payable upon hypothetical employment change events. The summaries allow the Committee to assess the cumulative impact of its past compensation decisions. Tally sheet review in 2018 did not lead to any specific compensation program changes.
Other Factors Considered in Setting Pay Opportunities for NEOs
The CEO and the Compensation Committee consider a number of factors in addition to the market data in determining individual pay amounts (base salaries, payout of the individual portion of short-term incentive and annual equity grants). Such factors include an individual's general level of performance, the individual's demonstrated success in meeting or exceeding business objectives and creating shareholder value, job market conditions, our operating environment and business challenges, the individual's importance to our business, succession planning considerations, salary budget guidelines and the individual's pay in the context of others at the Company. The application of discretion based on such factors may result in pay opportunities that are different from market as determined above. The Committee has not adopted a policy with regard to the relationship of compensation among the CEO and the other NEOs or other employees and exercises its discretion in determining actual and relative compensation levels. Overall compensation opportunities reflect our executives' positions, responsibilities and tenure.
Analysis of 2018 Compensation Decisions
2018 CEO Compensation
On April 16, 2018, Mark Begor was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. On March 27, 2018, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Begor to serve as Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Employment Agreement"). The Committee conducted a comprehensive market review in connection with the approval of his new hire compensation package. Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Begor's base salary is $1.5 million and he is eligible for an annual incentive bonus of 100% of his annual base salary with a maximum payout of 200% of annual base salary, depending on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Board. Mr. Begor's base salary and annual incentive target opportunity were prorated for 2018, reflecting his partial year of service. On May 4, 2018, in accordance with the Employment Agreement, Mr. Begor received an initial equity award with a value of $7 million, consisting of (i) $3.5 million in performance shares, (ii) $1.75 million in time-based RSUs and (iii) $1.75 million in stock options. In addition, Mr. Begor was awarded a one-time special grant in the amount of $10 million, comprised of equity awards in the same proportions as the initial equity
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    36
award above (the "New Hire Award"). The one-time New Hire Award was granted to compensate Mr. Begor for foregoing pay that had already been earned from his prior employer in order to assume the role of Equifax CEO. The terms of Mr. Begor's Employment Agreement are discussed in further detail under "CEO Employment Agreement" on page 46.
2018 Other NEO Compensation
Messrs. Gamble, Kelley, Farshchi and Koehler
In February 2018, following a thorough review and taking into account the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the Compensation Committee took the actions described below with respect to 2018 compensation for Messrs. Gamble and Kelley. Messrs. Farshchi and Koehler were hired in late February 2018 and June 2018, respectively. The Committee considered relevant market data in connection with the approval of their individual new hire compensation packages.
Mr. Barros
On September 26, 2017, Mr. Barros was appointed as our interim CEO and the Compensation Committee approved adjustments to his compensation package to reflect the changed scope of his role. During 2018, Mr. Barros served as interim CEO from January 1, 2018 to April 16, 2018. During that period, he received a monthly cash payment of $25,000 in addition to his existing annual base salary. When he became interim CEO, he continued to participate in the AIP with a target opportunity of 60% of his modified base salary with a maximum payout of 120% of salary. He also received a one-time appointment grant of $1.5 million in time-vested RSUs which vest three years from the grant date. Mr. Barros also received a special cash incentive opportunity of $500,000 in connection with his assumption of the role of interim Chief Executive Officer, which was paid on April 16, 2018.
During the period from April 17, 2018 to December 31, 2018, Mr. Barros received a monthly cash payment of $25,000 in addition to his then-effective annual base salary ($484,100). After leaving the role of interim CEO, he continued to participate in the AIP with a target opportunity of 60% of his modified base salary with a maximum payout of 120% of salary.
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Structures and Outcomes
Summary
Annual cash incentive awards are designed to reward the achievement of near-term business goals. In addition to financial metrics, annual incentive awards are based on an assessment of individual leadership qualities and contributions toward the achievement of business and strategic goals. In 2018, the Compensation Committee added a cybersecurity performance measure as one of the metrics under the AIP.
When setting the range of performance goals for Corporate Adjusted EPS and Corporate Operating Revenue at the outset of the fiscal year, the Compensation Committee considers our financial results from the prior year and our annual operating budget for the coming year. The Committee also considers the history of attainment of goals in prior years, economic and industry conditions, industry sector performance and the views of our shareholders.
The 2018 corporate financial performance goals for the NEOs with Company-wide responsibilities were based on Corporate Adjusted EPS (used to measure profitability) and Corporate Operating Revenue (used to measure top line business growth). We refer to this as the Corporate Plan. The financial goals for business unit leaders were focused primarily on relevant business unit revenue and operating income performance (used to measure unit growth and profitability), as well as Corporate Adjusted EPS (to emphasize profitability of the Company as a whole). We refer to these as Business Unit Plans.
Establishment of Corporate-Level Financial Goals
The Compensation Committee established corporate financial goals required to earn a cash incentive award for 2018 in a manner that was designed, within reasonable limits, to encourage achievement that exceeds target goals and penalize underachievement. The financial goals under our compensation program are established with reference to the projections set forth in our annual operating budget, which is approved by the Board. We set challenging but achievable goals, including maximum payout opportunities requiring exceptional performance, for the Company and our executives in order to drive the achievement of our short- and long-term objectives. In 2018, Messrs. Begor, Farshchi, Gamble, Kelley and Koehler were participants in the Corporate Plan. For the portions of 2018 that Mr. Barros served as interim CEO (January 1, 2018 to April 16, 2018) and during the period prior to his assumption of the role of President–USIS (April 17, 2018 to July 19, 2018), he was a participant in the Corporate Plan and his performance goals under the AIP were solely corporate-level financial goals.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    37
The corporate-level financial goals under the AIP were as follows:
Payouts for achievement between threshold and target, and between target and maximum, are determined based upon straight line interpolation. For 2018, Corporate Adjusted EPS was further adjusted to allocate part of an unbudgeted corporate-level income tax benefit from the corporate plan to participating business unit plans. Pursuant to the terms of the AIP, awards are subject to the Committee's authority to reduce awards through the exercise of its negative discretion and an individual award limit of $5 million.
Establishment of Business Unit-Level Financial Goals
The Compensation Committee established a Business Unit Plan for the Workforce Solutions, USIS, Global Consumer Solutions and International business units. The Compensation Committee established business unit-level financial goals required to earn a cash incentive award for 2018 in a manner designed, within reasonable limits, to encourage achievement that exceeds target goals and penalizes underachievement. Each Business Unit Plan included a corporate-level financial goal (Corporate Adjusted EPS) at a 30% weighting.
For the portion of 2018 that Mr. Barros served as President–USIS (July 20, 2018 to December 31, 2018), he participated in the Business Unit Plan for the USIS business unit.
The 2018 business unit objectives for Mr. Barros (during the portion of 2018 he participated in a Business Unit Plan) were established as follows:
Evaluation of Individual NEO Performance
Individual personal objectives are specific to each NEO and are subject to adjustment over the course of the year in view of business circumstances. In 2018, the general performance objectives for the leadership team included:
Key objectives for our NEOs and other members of the senior leadership team are typically addressed in the first quarter of each year, in connection with the preparation of the Company's business plan and overall strategy. At the end of each year, the CEO evaluates the performance of the other NEOs, taking into account performance for the just-completed versus predefined commitments for such year, as well as any unforeseen financial, operational and strategic issues and any other relevant information. These performance evaluations are subject to the review and approval of the Compensation Committee, which also evaluates the performance of the CEO in a similar manner, with input from the full Board.
For 2018, the plan structure set individual performance rating categories and award opportunities at needs improvement (no individual performance award), achieves expectations (award at 100% of Target), exceeds expectations (award at 150% of Target) and distinguished (award at 200% of Target).
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    38
Cybersecurity Performance Measure
In 2018, the Compensation Committee added a cybersecurity performance measure as one of the metrics under the AIP. The Committee believes that a cybersecurity performance measure that impacts compensation will support the Company's goal of leading our industry in data security. Performance relating to the cybersecurity metric will not increase, but it may decrease, the actual amount payable under the AIP. The extent of this reduction may range between 0% to 25% of the total AIP amount otherwise payable.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Technology Committee, established an objective cybersecurity performance measure that was designed to assess the Company's progress in improving the maturity of its security program. The Company's security program maturity is measured against goals established with respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") cybersecurity framework, which is a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk. The NIST framework enables organizations to benchmark and improve their information security based on five identified functions deemed critical to an effective security program: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. The Compensation Committee, based on the recommendation of the Technology Committee, established a threshold and target level of achievement for the AIP cybersecurity performance measure based on the NIST framework. These levels measure the progress the Company has made in enhancing its cybersecurity program. The target level is intended to be challenging yet reasonably achievable.
As contemplated under the Technology Committee charter, a third party consulting firm assisted the Technology Committee in establishing the security performance goal and measuring the Company's progress for 2018 for purposes of evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's overall security program. For AIP purposes, if the Company performed at threshold or below for the cybersecurity measure, then the AIP amount otherwise payable would be reduced by 25%. If the Company performed between threshold and target for the cybersecurity measure, then the AIP amounts otherwise payable would be reduced between 0% and 25% based on achievement between the threshold and target levels. If the Company achieved target or above for the cybersecurity measure, there would be no reduction to the AIP amount otherwise payable.
For 2018, the Company's performance for the cybersecurity measure was above target. As a result, the AIP amounts otherwise payable to the NEOs were not reduced.
Overview of 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Awards
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed each NEO's performance against the pre-established 2018 performance goals as approved by the Committee. Awards could range from 0% of the executive's award goal (for performance below the threshold level) to 200% of the individual's award target (for performance at the maximum level). Awards paid to our NEOs under the 2018 AIP were determined based upon achievement measured against specified financial goals (80% weighting) and individual objectives (20% weighting). The cybersecurity performance measure could also reduce an AIP amount otherwise payable by 0% to 25%. As described above, the Company's performance for the cybersecurity measure was above target and AIP amounts otherwise payable were not reduced. The target and maximum incentives, along with a summary of the actual 2018 awards earned by the NEOs, are set forth in the table below. A detailed description of how each NEO's 2018 incentive award was achieved follows the table.

Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
Summary
In February 2018, following a thorough review and taking into account feedback from investors, the Committee changed the 2018 LTI award mix for NEOs to consist of TSR performance shares (weighted 50%), RSUs (25%) and stock options (25%), as described in detail below. The Committee's purpose in establishing this award mix was to ensure that long-term incentive pay opportunities remain primarily performance-based, as well as provide more line-of-sight and become nearer to market in design. The Committee also eliminated from the award mix the performance shares tied to three-year cumulative Adjusted EPS to avoid any incentive to limit spending on cybersecurity.
The Committee considers individual performance relative to the prior year and the prior year's awards in granting long-term incentives. The value of equity grants increases with the level of position, and for the CEO and other NEOs is the largest element of the total compensation package. In determining the value of long-term incentive awards to executive officers other than the CEO, the Committee considers numerous factors including the benchmarking data described above, individual performance, the annual budget for equity awards and share run rate (a measure of actual equity-grant activity in relation to the total number of shares outstanding at the Company).
Performance Shares
TSR performance shares will be earned, if at all, based on the percentile ranking of the Company's cumulative TSR compared to the TSR of the companies in the S&P 500 Index (as constituted on the initial grant date, subject to certain adjustments) after a three-year performance period. This metric aligns with shareholder interests as higher cumulative TSR results in higher relative returns for shareholders as well as ensuring a correlation between performance and payouts. TSR performance shares granted in 2017 and later accrue dividend equivalent units which vest at the same time and at the same level of award attainment as the underlying shares.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    42
The number of TSR performance shares payable is the target award multiplied by a percentage (from 0% to 200%) calculated by taking the average of the payout percentages achieved for each of the last four quarters of the performance period based upon the Company's cumulative TSR percentile ranking through the end of each such quarter. The award payout will nonetheless be capped at 100% if the Company's average cumulative TSR percentile rank for the last four quarters of the performance period is equal to or greater than 50th percentile but the Company's three-year cumulative TSR for the performance period is negative. Basing the award payout on the average of the payout percentages for each of the last four quarters of the three-year performance period counterbalances potential late performance period volatility and reflects performance over the whole period.
Payouts in February 2021 (if any) for the performance shares awarded on March 5, 2018 will be based on the following scale, with straight-line interpolation between the threshold and maximum levels:
TSR PERFORMANCE SHARES: PERFORMANCE/PAYOUT SCALE
The TSR performance shares granted in 2018 were tracking at the 31st percentile (53% payment) at December 31, 2018.
Stock Options
The exercise price of stock options granted in 2018 is equal to the fair market value of our stock on the grant date. The stock options vest ratably over three years, assuming continued employment with the Company. The term of the stock options granted in 2018 is 10 years from the grant date, with certain exceptions in connection with a termination of employment or job elimination. Stock options granted in 2018 were underwater (exercise price above the stock price) as of December 31, 2018.
RSUs
RSUs represent the right to receive unrestricted shares of our common stock once applicable service vesting requirements are satisfied. The RSUs issued to NEOs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs granted in 2017 and later accrue dividend equivalent units. RSUs are used primarily for retention purposes.
Determination of 2018 LTI Grant Values
The Compensation Committee determined long-term incentive grant values by establishing a dollar value for each NEO other than the CEO and then converting this dollar value to a number of performance shares, RSUs and stock options based on the closing stock price of the Company's common stock on the relevant grant date. The number of stock options granted is equal to the market value allocated to that component divided by 25% of fair market stock value on the grant date.
The following table details the target grant value used by the Compensation Committee to determine the number of performance shares, RSUs and stock options granted to each NEO in 2018. Actual grant date values, computed in accordance with applicable accounting standards, are disclosed in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 54. The actual value of equity awards that may be realized by the NEOs will depend on their continued service and our future stock price performance.
TARGET GRANT VALUE FOR 2018 ANNUAL EQUITY AWARDS
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    43
2018 New Hire LTI Awards
In addition to the annual LTI award, in connection with his appointment as CEO, Mr. Begor was awarded a one-time New Hire Award in the amount of $10 million. The one-time New Hire Award was granted to compensate Mr. Begor for foregoing pay that had already been earned from his prior employer in order to assume the role of Equifax CEO. The terms of Mr. Begor's Employment Agreement, including details regarding the New Hire Award, are discussed under "CEO Employment Agreement" on page 46.
In connection with their new leadership positions with the Company and to compensate them for foregoing pay previously earned at their prior employers, in addition to the annual LTI award, Messrs. Farshchi and Koehler were granted additional RSUs with grant date fair values of $2,250,000 and $4,800,000, respectively. Mr. Farshchi's RSUs vest equally on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date (March 5, 2018). Mr. Koehler's RSUs vest in three equal increments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date (July 27, 2018).
2018 Special LTI Awards
To ensure continuity of leadership following the appointment of Mr. Begor as our CEO, in addition to the annual LTI award grant, Messrs. Gamble and Kelley were each granted additional RSUs and stock options with an aggregate grant date fair value of $1,000,000, and Mr. Barros was granted additional RSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $500,000. The RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date (July 27, 2018) and the stock options vest in three equal increments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
2016-2018 Performance Share Awards
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting and payment of the FY2016-FY2018 performance shares at 27.5% of their target award level. The Committee's determination was based on the Company's achievement of total shareholder return relative to companies in the S&P 500 Index (as constituted on the initial grant date, subject to certain adjustments) over the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018. The number of performance shares payable was the target award multiplied by a percentage (from 0% to 200%) that was calculated by taking the average of the payout percentages achieved for each of the last four quarters of the performance period, based upon the Company's cumulative TSR percentile ranking through the end of each such quarter, as shown in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table on page 56. The FY2016-FY2018 performance share awards were paid to Messrs. Gamble, Kelley and Barros.
Decline in Value of Long-Term Incentives Demonstrates Intended Link to Performance
Our performance-based executive compensation program has operated as designed to align executive pay with performance. Following the announcement of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the value of LTI awards held by our NEOs has declined significantly, consistent with our strong performance-based program design:
The chart below compares the target grant date fair value of outstanding LTI awards held by our NEOs to the value of such awards as of December 31, 2018:
This chart reflects the following: (i) outstanding LTI compensation values; (ii) value for TSR performance shares assumes payout at the relative price and performance level achieved as of the applicable date; (iii) value for Adjusted EPS performance shares assumes payout based on expected achievement of the performance measure as of the applicable date; and (iv) intrinsic value of outstanding stock options, all of which were underwater (exercise price above the stock price) as of December 31, 2018.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    44
Equity Award Grant Practices
We have a written policy on equity grants designed to formalize our equity grant practices and ensure that equity awards will be made on specified dates. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual equity-based awards to senior executives who are reporting officers under Section 16 of the Exchange Act in the first calendar quarter of each year (around the time of their annual performance reviews). In accordance with our policy and shareholder-approved 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee has delegated specific authority to the CEO to approve grants to non-executive officers and other eligible employees, typically in the fall of each year following their annual talent review cycle. We may make equity awards at other times during the year for new hires or other reasons, such as a job promotion or as a result of an acquisition.
We generally schedule Board and Committee meetings at least a year in advance and, as noted above, make annual equity awards to our NEOs at around the same time every year.
Retirement and Other Benefits
Our NEOs receive retirement, deferred compensation and other benefits that are designed to be part of a competitive package to attract and retain executive talent. We maintain the following retirement, deferred compensation and other benefit plans, in which all or some of our NEOs participate: 
401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan that permits eligible employees (including NEOs) to defer a portion of their compensation and receive Company matching contributions.
Supplemental Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives of Equifax Inc. (the "SERP") covers certain of our NEOs as well as certain senior executive officers designated by the Compensation Committee. The SERP provides monthly supplemental retirement benefits after retirement. The SERP was closed to new participants after January 1, 2016. After that date, NEOs and other executives may instead be eligible to receive supplemental retirement contributions under the plan described below.
Supplemental Contribution Plan. In 2016, we amended the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDCP") to establish a supplemental retirement contributions program (the "Supplemental Contribution Plan") for senior executive officers designated by the Compensation Committee. The Supplemental Contribution Plan provides for an annual contribution equal to 10% of the sum of the eligible executive's base salary and bonus earned for the year. NEOs who participate in the SERP are not eligible to participate in the Supplemental Contribution Plan.
Deferred Compensation Plans. The NEOs and other executives are eligible to participate in the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans. These plans allow participants to elect to defer cash compensation and receipt of shares of Company stock on vesting of RSU awards. Deferred amounts are payable upon the executive's retirement or other termination of employment.
Other Benefits. We provide our NEOs with benefits generally available to our U.S. employees, including medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability insurance benefits. We also provide our NEOs with certain perquisites that the Company believes enhances their performance of services for the Company, including an annual physical, financial planning and personal liability insurance.
A more complete description of these plans is provided under "Additional Discussion of Material Items in Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Award Tables" on page 55, "Pension Benefits at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" on page 57 and "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" on page 58.
Limited Perquisites
We offer limited perquisites to our executive officers. Perquisites for our executives have the following objectives:
The NEOs are eligible to receive financial planning and tax services in an annual amount of up to $50,000 for the CEO and $10,000 for other NEOs ($12,500 in their first year for newly-hired executives), comprehensive medical examinations and personal excess liability insurance ($10 million for the CEO and $5 million for the other NEOs). Mr. Begor does not receive a number of perquisites provided to our former CEO, namely, life insurance, home security and payment of club dues. In 2018, we provided relocation benefits to Mr. Begor in connection with his relocation to Atlanta as part of his appointment as CEO. The attributed costs of perquisites are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 52 and Note 9 thereto. Since 2011, we no longer provide tax reimbursement on the value of the applicable perquisite other than relocation and foreign tax expenses.

CEO Employment Agreement
On March 27, 2018, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Begor to serve as Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Employment Agreement"). The term of the Employment Agreement commenced on April 16, 2018, and will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Begor's base salary is $1.5 million (pro-rated for 2018), subject to increase, but not decrease, by the Board or the Compensation Committee, and he is eligible for an annual incentive bonus of 100% of his annual base salary (the "Target Annual Bonus Opportunity") with a maximum payout of 200% of annual base salary, depending on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Board. For 2018, Mr. Begor's Target Annual Bonus Opportunity was pro-rated.
Under the Employment Agreement, in May 2018, Mr. Begor was granted an initial long-term incentive award with a value of $7 million, consisting of (i) $3.5 million in performance shares, (ii) $1.75 million in time-based RSUs and (iii) $1.75 million in stock options. In addition, Mr. Begor was awarded a one-time New Hire Award in the amount of $10 million, comprised of equity awards in the same proportions and with the same vesting terms as the initial equity award above. Mr. Begor is eligible to receive additional equity grants in 2019 and future years, as determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, provided that the total value at grant will be at least $7 million annually. Mr. Begor's current and future equity awards and other incentive compensation, except for his New Hire Award, are subject to the Company's enhanced clawback policy adopted in March 2018. The one-time New Hire Award was granted to compensate Mr. Begor for foregoing pay that had already been earned from his prior employer in order to assume the role of Equifax CEO. In structuring Mr. Begor's compensation package, the Committee and Board deemed it appropriate to structure the New Hire Award in a form that was similar to the structure of his prior compensation package. With this in mind, the Committee and Board concluded that the Company's enhanced clawback policy should not apply to such award. Mr. Begor participates in the Company's incentive, savings, retirement and welfare benefit plans and programs made available to newly-appointed senior executives. Mr. Begor also receives perquisites that include health care, financial planning and a tax preparation services allowance. These perquisites serve the important business purposes of ensuring that our CEO is aware of his personal health and receives adequate assistance in managing his personal finances, each of which enables him to focus his time on managing our business.
If Mr. Begor is terminated by the Company without "cause" (other than due to "disability" or death) or resigns for "good reason" (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), he will be entitled to receive, provided he signs a release of claims against the Company and complies with applicable restrictive covenants, (i) a severance payment equal to twice the sum of (x) his annual base salary and (y) his target annual bonus opportunity for the year of termination, (ii) any accrued but unpaid annual bonus plus a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination, (iii) full acceleration of vesting as of the termination date of the New Hire Award (subject, in the case of performance-based awards, to certification by the Board of the Company's performance), (iv) for all other equity awards, continued vesting under the Company's equity incentive plan until the second anniversary of the termination date (subject, in the case of performance-based awards, to certification by the Board of the Company's performance), with vested stock options being exercisable until the second anniversary of termination (or, to the extent such options vest within the 90 days before such second anniversary, until such 90 day period after such vesting has elapsed) (but not beyond their original expiration date) and (v) access to the Company's health plan for two years or the lesser period permitted by the Company's general benefits plans and applicable law and monthly payments of or an amount equal to premiums for continuation of healthcare coverage under Section 4980B of the Code or comparable law ("COBRA") for 24 months.
If Mr. Begor is terminated by the Company without "cause" (other than due to "disability" or death) or resigns for "good reason" within the period six months prior to and two years after a "change in control" (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), he will be entitled to receive, provided he signs a release of claims against the Company and complies with applicable restrictive covenants, (i) a lump sum payment equal to three times the sum of (x) his annual base salary and (y) his target annual bonus opportunity for the year of termination, (ii) any accrued but unpaid annual bonus plus a pro rata annual bonus for the year of termination, (iii) full vesting of any outstanding equity awards (subject, in the case of performance-based awards, to the determination of achievement of the performance measures in accordance with the applicable award agreement and incentive plan) and (iv) access to the Company's health plan for two years or the lesser period permitted by the Company's general benefits plans and applicable law and monthly payments of or an amount equal to premiums under COBRA for 24 months.
Mr. Begor is required to own and hold Company stock having a value equal to six times his annual base salary within five years of his appointment.
The Employment Agreement contains confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of the Employment Agreement and for certain specified periods thereafter, that are comparable to the restrictions applicable to other senior executives.
Except as described above, employment agreements are not used with respect to any other executive officer, each of whom is employed on an "at will" basis.
Change in Control Arrangements
We had previously entered into change in control agreements with certain executive officers, including Messrs. Gamble, Kelley and Barros, which are more fully described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" beginning on page 60. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted the Equifax Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan"), which replaced the prior change in control agreements between the Company and all executive officers who previously were party to an existing change in control agreement, including Messrs. Gamble, Kelley and Barros. Messrs. Farshchi and Koehler were not previously party to an individual change in control agreement with the Company. The CIC Plan applies to each of our NEOs and senior executives, except our CEO.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    46
The severance benefits applicable to Mr. Begor in the event of a change of control are contained in his employment agreement with the Company, as described above. See "2019 Change in Control Severance Plan" on pages 65-66 for more information on the CIC Plan.
Consideration of Certain Tax Effects
The Company's annual tax deduction for compensation paid to each of the NEOs and certain other current or former officers who are subject to the compensation limits of Code Section 162(m) is capped at $1 million. Section 162(m) previously provided an exemption from the $1 million cap for compensation qualifying as "performance-based" compensation if certain requirements were met. Prior to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we historically designed our annual incentive and long-term incentive programs for NEOs to qualify for that exemption. As a result of tax legislation that was enacted December 22, 2017, the exemption for performance-based compensation was repealed effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the number of employees who are considered "covered employees" subject to the Section 162(m) limit was expanded to include the Chief Financial Officer (who was previously excluded) and certain former NEOs and other officers.
As a result of these changes, compensation in excess of $1 million paid to covered employees will not be deductible in 2018 or future years unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 and not materially modified on or after such date. The Compensation Committee has taken steps that it deemed appropriate with the intention of preserving the deductibility of certain awards granted prior to the enactment of this tax legislation. Due to the uncertainties of the scope of the transition relief, however, there are no assurances that any compensation paid to our covered employees will be or will remain exempt from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit.
The Compensation Committee will continue to consider these implications, including the potential lack of deductibility under Section 162(m), among several factors when making compensation decisions, but the Compensation Committee has provided and reserves the right to provide compensation that does not qualify as deductible under Section 162(m).
Compensation Design Process
Role of the Compensation Committee and Management in Determining Executive Compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews and makes decisions about executive policies and plans, including the amount of base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive awarded to our NEOs. Our CEO and other executives may assist the Committee from time to time in its evaluation of compensation elements or program design or by providing mathematical calculations, historical information, year-over-year comparisons and clarification regarding job duties and performance. In addition, for the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the Committee considered recommendations from members of management concerning the performance metric related to cybersecurity. The Compensation Committee also considers recommendations from its compensation consultant and competitive data and makes decisions, as it deems appropriate, on executive compensation based on its assessment of individual performance and achievement of goals both by the individual and the Company.
The CEO's performance is reviewed by the Compensation Committee with input from the other non-management members of the Board. The CEO annually reviews the performance of each other executive officer who reports to him, including the NEOs. The conclusions reached and recommendations made based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and annual award amounts, are presented to the Compensation Committee for approval. Members of management play various additional roles in this process:
The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations and exercises discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to executives based on considerations it deems appropriate. Although members of our management team participate in the executive compensation process, the Compensation Committee also meets regularly in executive session without any members of the management team present. The Compensation Committee makes the final determination of the executive compensation package provided to each of our NEOs.
Compensation Consultant Services and Independence. The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners LLC ("Meridian"), a national executive compensation consulting firm, to provide advice with respect to 2018 compensation for our NEOs and other officers. Meridian performed services solely on behalf of the Committee and did not provide any other services to us. Management of the Company had no role in selecting the Committee's compensation consultant and had no separate relationship with Meridian. The Committee assessed the independence of Meridian pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Meridian from independently representing the Committee.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    47
Meridian performed the following services     for the Committee in 2018: reviewed market benchmarking data and prepared market data for the CEO position; updated tally     sheets; assessed incentive risk and proxy disclosure; assisted with the development of our 2019 peer group; reviewed     regulatory and governance guidance and pay-for-performance updates. Meridian assisted the Committee in determining     appropriate levels of compensation for the CEO and other executive officers. The firm attended all regular Committee meetings     in 2018 upon invitation and participated in executive sessions without management present.
In January 2019, the Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), a national executive compensation consulting firm, to provide advice with respect to 2019 compensation for our NEOs and other officers. FW Cook performs services solely on behalf of the Committee and does not provide any other services to us. Management of the Company had no role in selecting the Committee's compensation consultant and has no separate relationship with FW Cook. The Committee has assessed the independence of FW Cook pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent FW Cook from independently representing the Committee. FW Cook assisted the Committee in determining appropriate levels of compensation for the CEO and other executive officers for 2019.
Management of Compensation-Related Risk
In establishing and reviewing the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not. The Committee reviewed our material compensation programs and noted numerous ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated. This evaluation for 2018, which was conducted with the assistance of management and the Committee's then-current outside compensation consultant (Meridian), covered a wide range of practices and policies. All plans were deemed to have substantial risk mitigators which, in the most material incentive plans, include a balanced mix of fixed and variable pay and short- and long-term incentives; use of multiple performance measures including corporate, business unit and individual performance weightings in incentive plans; a portfolio of long-term equity incentives including time-based and performance-based measures; caps, discretion in payment, oversight by non-plan participants, significant stock ownership guidelines, pre-approval requirements for executive stock transactions; and the existence of policies prohibiting Company stock hedging and pledging and requiring executive incentive compensation recoupment in specified circumstances.
The Compensation Committee has also reviewed the Company's overall enterprise risks and how compensation programs for employees generally impacted individual behavior that could exacerbate these enterprise risks. Board and management processes are in place to oversee risk associated with global compensation programs and practices, including, but not limited to, regular business reviews; alignment of compensation plan goals with our annual and long-term strategic goals and performance expectations; review of enterprise risk management by the Board as part of the annual strategy and budget reviews; and other appropriate internal controls. The Committee concluded that the Company's compensation plans, programs and policies, considered as a whole, including applicable risk-mitigation features, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Policies on Clawback of Incentive Compensation
Enhanced Clawback Policy. In March 2018, the Board adopted an enhanced clawback policy. The policy covers all employees, including executive officers, and applies to equity awards and other incentive compensation awarded to such employees (excluding the one-time New Hire Award granted to our CEO in May 2018 as described under "Employment Agreement and Change in Control Severance Plan"). The Compensation Committee has discretion to apply the policy to recover and recoup incentive compensation in all of the events described below.
The provisions of the policy are summarized in the table below:
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    48
The policy also provides that the Company will disclose its decision to take action, the number of employees impacted and their seniority, and the aggregate amount of the clawback/forfeiture if the underlying circumstances of the misconduct are publicly disclosed. The policy provides that the Committee may limit or eliminate disclosure if the events are not publicly disclosed or if disclosure would be likely to result in or exacerbate any litigation or other proceeding against the Company or its officers or directors, violate applicable law with respect to privacy, violate legal privilege or breach a contractual obligation.
Under the terms of award agreements issued under our 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, employees, including the NEOs, who violate the agreement's non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disclosure restrictions or who engage in certain other activities detrimental to the Company may be subject to financial consequences, including cancellation of their outstanding equity awards or recovery by the Company of all gains from exercised stock options and vested shares received during the period beginning six months prior to the date of the violation. In addition, these recovery means are also applicable to the incentive equity awards of any employee who is terminated for cause, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.
These clawback policies are in addition to any policies or recovery rights provided under applicable law.
Stock Ownership Requirements
The Compensation Committee recognizes the critical role that executive stock ownership has in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders. As such, we maintain a formal stock ownership policy, under which our CEO and our other senior executives are required to acquire and hold Equifax common stock with a market value of six times base salary and three times base salary, respectively, within five years of assuming their respective positions. A reduction in ownership to one half of these requirements is allowed for executives age 60 or older who are eligible for retirement. As of December 31, 2018, all of our executive officers were in compliance with our stock ownership requirements.
Hedging and Pledging Policies
Under our insider trading policy, we prohibit hedging the economic risk of ownership of our common stock through short sales or the purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles, equity swaps or other derivative securities that are directly linked to Company stock, by our directors, officers and employees. We also prohibit our directors and executive officers from holding our stock in a margin account or pledging our stock as collateral for a loan.
Actions Taken with Respect to 2019 Compensation
Context for 2019 Compensation Decisions
Following the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the Compensation Committee undertook a comprehensive review of our short- and long-term incentive compensation program, taking into consideration the perspective of our shareholders. In February 2018, the Committee made certain changes in an effort to ensure compensation reflected key business priorities and Company-wide focus on data security, while also ensuring that the Company can attract and retain talented employees in order to create value for shareholders and provide appropriate incentives for executives managing those data security efforts. One such change was the addition of a cybersecurity performance measure as a metric under the 2018 AIP. Achievement of this cybersecurity metric cannot increase an NEO's payout under the AIP, but underachievement will decrease the payout. The Committee also changed the LTI program to eliminate the three-year cumulative Adjusted EPS metric in the performance shares to avoid possible incentive to limit spending on cybersecurity. The resulting 2018 LTI mix consisted of performance shares tied to three-year relative cumulative TSR (weighted 50%), stock options (25%) and time-based RSUs with a three-year cliff vesting schedule (25%).
Transforming Our LTI Approach to Reflect EFX2020 Business Transformation Strategy
In February 2019, in connection with our previously-announced business transformation strategy, the Compensation Committee reformulated the long-term incentive program for 2019 to align incentives with our near- and long-term goals.
Since his appointment in April 2018, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Begor, has been leading Equifax through a significant transformation, including the investment of substantial resources to achieve our objective of becoming a trusted global leader in data security, advanced analytics and technology. On February 21, 2019, we outlined the key strategic initiatives that comprise EFX2020, our multi-year business transformation strategy, as described further on page 5. Our business strategy is described in more detail in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
To strengthen the alignment between our NEOs and our shareholders, and to reward efforts related to driving the Company's progress towards delivering on our strategic objectives, the Committee modified our long-term incentive program for 2019 by adopting the Equifax Transformation Leadership Program ("2019 ETLP"). The 2019 ETLP, which includes the NEOs and senior leadership team members who are integral to the successful execution of our strategy, increases over 2018 levels the grant date fair value of the total long-term
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    49
incentive opportunity and utilizes more challenging performance thresholds required to earn payouts. The 2019 ETLP is intended to motivate our NEOs and key leaders to achieve the specific goals as outlined in our EFX2020 multi-year business transformation strategy, which were designed to shape corporate performance for the long term and drive shareholder returns, consistent with the multi-year performance periods in the 2019 ETLP. The Committee intends to revert to the traditional long-term incentive structure in 2020.
The components of the 2019 ETLP include TSR performance shares, premium-priced stock options and time-based RSUs. Notably, the entirety of the incremental award opportunity delivered in 2019 is tied to performance shares and premium-priced stock options, which are earned only if our team delivers results that meet or exceed the performance criteria. The design of the 2019 ETLP acknowledges the increased efforts of our executive officers to lead the successful execution of our core strategic imperatives tied to our business strategy, focuses executive officers on efficiently achieving key targets under EFX2020 within a designated time frame, and uses performance-based equity award structures to drive alignment of the interests of our executives and shareholders.
The following table illustrates the grant date fair value of long-term incentives awarded under the 2018 LTIP and the 2019 ETLP to our CEO and other current NEOs, excluding Mr. Barros, who is not a participant in the 2019 ETLP.
Under the 2019 ETLP:
Performance Shares. This metric aligns with shareholder interests as higher cumulative TSR results in higher returns for shareholders and ensures a close correlation between performance and payouts. Performance shares are earned, if at all, based on the percentile ranking of the Company's cumulative TSR compared to the TSR of the companies in the S&P 500 Index (as constituted on the initial grant date, subject to certain adjustments) after a three-year performance period. TSR performance shares granted in 2017 and later accrue dividend equivalent units, which are payable only with regard to earned shares that are delivered upon settlement.
The number of TSR performance shares payable to executives is calculated by multiplying the target award by a percentage (from 0% to 200%) as illustrated in the table below:
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    50
The percentage is determined by taking an average of the payout percentages achieved for each of the last four quarters of the performance period based on the Company's cumulative TSR percentile ranking through the end of each such quarter. Basing the award payout on the average of the payout percentages for each of the last four quarters of the three-year performance period counterbalances potential late performance period volatility and reflects performance over the whole period. If our team does not deliver threshold performance, the value of the performance shares will be $0. In addition, in the event that cumulative TSR is negative over the three-year performance period, the payout is capped at 100% of the target shares irrespective of the Company's TSR percentile rank versus peers.
Premium-Priced Stock Options. The use of premium-priced stock options, rather than traditional stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date, tightens the link between our long-term incentive compensation and creation of shareholder value by ensuring that executives receive gains only after a preferred return is first delivered to investors, thereby reducing the possibility that broad industry or market growth, as opposed to Company-specific performance, leads to executive gains. If our team is not able to drive share price returns in excess of the exercise price before the expiration date, the realized value of these stock options will be $0.
The exercise prices of stock options granted in 2019 were set above the fair market value of our stock in three equally weighted tranches (based on fair value on the date of grant) with exercise prices of 115%, 125% and 135% of the fair market value of our stock. The premium-priced stock options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, assuming continued employment with the Company. The term of the premium-priced stock options is six years from the grant date.
RSUs. We use RSUs to retain our employees over the long-term and simultaneously inspire our team to focus on corporate performance. The RSUs issued to NEOs vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs granted in 2017 and later accrue dividend equivalent units. The value of RSUs varies directly with the market price of our common stock, which creates an added incentive to make decisions that will build shareholder value over the long-term.
Other Actions in 2019
The Compensation Committee will continue to monitor our executive compensation program to ensure that it is consistent with the Company's objectives, provides appropriate incentives to management, and remains competitive with other companies in the industries in which we operate or with which we compete for executive talent.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Phillip Humann, Mark Feidler, Robert Marcus, Siri Marshall and Robert Selander were members of the Compensation Committee during 2018. Mr. Humann retired from the Board on May 3, 2018. None of these directors is or has been an executive officer of the Company, or had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related party transactions. None of the Company's executive officers served as a director or a member of a compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity, the executive officers of which served as a director of the Company or a member of the Compensation Committee during 2018.

2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards
Set forth below is information regarding awards provided to the NEOs in 2018. The non-equity incentive awards were made under the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") which is part of our shareholder-approved amended and restated 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan"). The equity awards were also made under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Additional Discussion of Material Items in Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Tables
Our executive compensation policies and practices, pursuant to which the compensation set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table was paid or awarded, are described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 30. A summary of certain material terms of our compensation plans and arrangements is set forth below.
2018 Annual Incentive Plan. Annual incentive opportunities awarded to our NEOs are earned based on Company performance against one-year operating objectives and individual performance metrics. The actual amount of annual incentive earned by each NEO pursuant to the individual performance portion is reported in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. Annual incentive plan thresholds, targets and maximums are identified for each NEO in the "Estimated Possible Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" column of the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 54. Additional information regarding the design of the annual incentive plan is included in the CD&A.
401(k) Plan. We sponsor a tax-qualified 401(k) Plan in which eligible salaried employees may participate in either a basic plan or an enhanced plan put into place following the 2008 freeze of certain benefits payable to non-grandfathered employees under the USRIP as summarized below. In 2018, we matched either 50% of the first 6% of pay, or 100% of 4% of pay an employee contributed on a pre-tax or after-tax basis to the plan (subject to the government limit on compensation, or $275,000 in 2018) (the "basic plan"). Participants, excluding participants in the SERP, also receive a direct Company contribution (the "enhanced plan"), under which Equifax may make a contribution of between 1.5% and 4% of pay based on years of service, even if employees do not choose to make a 401(k) Plan contribution, and also may provide a 100% match on employee 401(k) Plan contributions up to 4% of pay compared to a 50% match on the first 6% of employees' contributions in the previous 401(k) Plan. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the Company approved a change to the 401(k) Plan to eliminate the direct Company contribution and increase the discretionary match under the enhanced plan to 100% of the first 5% of pay contributed by the employee.
U.S. Retirement Income Plan. The USRIP is a tax-qualified defined benefit plan that covered eligible salaried U.S. employees. The USRIP has been frozen for U.S. employees who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria (i.e., those employees who were not retirement-eligible on the freeze date, which includes all of the NEOs), and provide these employees and certain other employees not eligible to participate in the USRIP with an enhanced 401(k) Plan described above. The pension plan amendments freeze service credit as of December 31, 2008, and salary increases as of December 31, 2012. Certain NEOs participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives of Equifax Inc. ("SERP") and do not participate in the enhanced 401(k) Plan. The changes did not affect our U.S. retirees, former employees with vested benefits or employees who were eligible to retire prior to January 1, 2009 (the "grandfathered group"). Members of the grandfathered group who were still employed on December 31, 2014 had their pension benefits fully frozen on this date.
Executive Life and Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan. The Executive Life Plan provides executive life insurance benefits, which may also include capital accumulation benefits. The Executive Life Plan's grantor trust is used to ensure that the insurance premiums due under this plan are paid in case we fail to make scheduled payments following a change in control, as defined in the trust agreement. The Executive Life Plan was amended and restated effective July 2002 to provide that executive officers will receive only life insurance benefits and no retirement benefits under the plan, in order to make permanent our suspension of premium payments after July 30, 2002 in compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibitions against company loans to their executive officers.

The following table shows the present value at December 31, 2018 of accumulated benefits payable to each of our NEOs at the earliest unreduced retirement age (age 60 or current age for executives over the age of 60), including the number of years of service credited to each NEO, under the SERP. Age 60 is the earliest age at which a participant can begin receiving an unreduced early retirement benefit under the SERP. No pre-retirement mortality was assumed. Messrs. Gamble, Kelley and Barros are currently eligible for retirement under the SERP.
Pension Benefits at 2018 Fiscal Year-End
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    57
Supplemental Retirement Plan. The SERP covers the NEOs and other senior executive officers designated by the Compensation Committee. Messrs. Begor, Farshchi and Koehler do not participate in the SERP. The plan provides benefits that supplement the USRIP benefits. The SERP provides an annual benefit equal to 2.5% of "average annual earnings" times years of service as a senior executive officer (up to 10 years), plus 1.67% of average annual earnings multiplied by years of service as a senior executive officer in excess of 10 years (up to 20 years). "Average annual earnings" for this purpose means the highest paid 36 consecutive months of employment and includes base salary and annual incentives. For service as a senior executive officer in excess of 20 years or in a position other than as a senior executive officer, a participant receives a "restoration benefit" using a formula similar to that of the USRIP, without the IRS limits on compensation. In general, only actual years of service with the Company are credited for purposes of determining the SERP benefit. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company prospectively eliminated additional years of SERP service credit for new employment or other agreements. In November 2015, the Company closed the SERP to new participants.
The benefit under the SERP is reduced by the benefit payable under the USRIP and is paid without regard to the limitations under Code Sections 401(a) and 415. However, the maximum aggregate benefit from both the SERP and the USRIP cannot exceed 50% of the executive's average total earnings.
The normal retirement age under the SERP is age 65. However, participants can retire early once they reach age 55 if they have five years of service under the plan. The benefit would be reduced to reflect the early commencement of the benefit.
The benefit for senior executive officer service is unreduced at age 60, with reductions from age 60 for those who retire prior to age 60. The "restoration benefit" is reduced from normal retirement age to the participant's early retirement age in the same manner as the USRIP. The normal form of benefit and optional forms of benefit are the same as those in the USRIP.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The following table sets forth information regarding the NEOs' participation in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2018. All of the balances relate to executives' own deferred amounts. Cash deferrals are invested in investment funds available to the general public. Stock deferrals are deferred as stock equivalent units with earnings and losses solely attributable to changes in our stock price. We do not make any additional contributions to such plans, except as explained on page 59 with respect to the Supplemental Contribution Plan.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    58
Supplemental Contribution Plan. After the SERP was closed to new participants in 2015, the Company amended its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan to add provisions to permit senior executive officers designated by the Compensation Committee to receive supplemental retirement contributions (the "Supplemental Contribution Plan"). NEOs and senior executive officers who participate in the SERP are not eligible to participate in the Supplemental Contribution Plan. Messrs. Begor, Farshchi and Koehler participate in the Supplemental Contribution Plan.
The Supplemental Contribution Plan provides for an annual contribution equal to 10% of the sum of the eligible executive's base salary and annual bonus earned for the year. The Company's contributions are credited to an account for the executive and the executive directs the investments of the account among designated investment alternatives. The account fully vests upon the executive's completion of three years of service after the date the executive becomes a participant in the plan. The account also fully vests upon the executive's termination of employment as a result of death or disability.
Upon the executive's termination of employment after age 55 (or in the event of death or disability), the vested amount credited to the account is payable in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 15 years. If the executive terminates employment prior to age 55 (except for death or disability), the vested account is not payable until the executive attains age 55 and is paid in a lump sum.
Deferred Compensation Plans. We maintain two deferred compensation plans that allow for certain management employees to defer the receipt of compensation (such as salary, incentive compensation and/or stock from vested shares) until a later date based on the terms of the plans. The benefits under our deferred compensation plans are represented by the assets of a grantor trust which, through our funding, makes investments in certain mutual funds and stock. The purpose of this trust is to ensure the distribution of benefits by participants in the deferred compensation plans. However, all benefits under the plan are non-funded obligations of the Company and are subject to the claims of creditors.
Director and Executive Stock Deferral Plan. This plan permits the directors, NEOs and other eligible employees to defer taxes upon the vesting of RSUs. Participants may defer 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the portion of the grant that is vesting. Stock deferrals track the performance of our common stock, without credit for dividends. The participant receives the right to a number of shares of deferred stock. In general, amounts deferred under the plan are not paid until the participant retires. However, participants may also establish sub-accounts from which amounts are to be paid on specific pre-retirement timetables established by the director or executive officer, referred to as a scheduled withdrawal. Amounts deferred are paid in our common stock, either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 15 years for retirement distributions, or up to five years for a scheduled withdrawal. The Company makes no contributions to this plan but pays all administrative costs and expenses.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. This nonqualified plan is a tax deferred compensation program for a limited number of executives, including NEOs, and provides a tax favorable vehicle for deferring annual compensation, including base salary and annual incentive. Under the plan, an executive may defer up to 75% of his or her base salary and up to 100% of any incentive payment. Amounts deferred are credited with gains or losses which mirror the performance of benchmark investment funds selected by the participant from among several publicly-available investment funds. The plan does not offer any above-market or preferential rates of return to the NEOs. Amounts deferred are paid, at the participant's option, either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 15 years for retirement or termination distributions, or up to five years for a scheduled withdrawal. The Company pays all administrative costs and expenses of the plan.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control
The following tables summarize the value of potential payments and benefits that our NEOs would receive if they had terminated employment on December 31, 2018 under the circumstances shown. The tables exclude amounts that would be paid in the normal course of continued employment, such as accrued but unpaid salary and earned annual bonus for 2018, and vested account balances in our 401(k) Plan that are generally available to all of our active U.S. salaried employees. The tables also reflect the amounts that the NEOs would receive under our new CIC Plan, which was adopted in February 2019 and applies to our NEOs other than Mr. Begor. Messrs. Farshchi and Koehler were not party to an individual change in control agreement with the Company prior to their participation in the CIC Plan as of February 2019. Actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such executive's termination of service.

Payments Made Upon Termination
Regardless of the manner in which an NEO's employment terminates, the executive is entitled to receive amounts earned during the executive's term of employment. The amounts include:
Equifax Inc. Severance Plan
Under this plan, our full-time U.S. salaried employees are eligible for a severance benefit in the event: (i) their employment is terminated because of the elimination of their position, unless they were offered replacement employment as defined in the plan; (ii) their office is relocated to a place requiring a commute more than 35 miles longer than their prior commute; or (iii) they are terminated due to inability or failure to meet job expectations, provided the employee signs a general release of claims. The amount of the severance benefit is determined based on the employee's length of service and base salary. In general, for job elimination or relocation, an eligible exempt
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    63
employee is entitled to receive four weeks of severance for any portion of their first year of service plus two weeks for each year of completed service, up to 52 weeks. Termination for inability or failure to meet job expectations of eligible exempt employees entitles the employee to four weeks of severance for less than five years of service, eight weeks of severance for at least five but less than 10 years of service, and 12 weeks of severance for 10 or more years of service.
Payments Made Upon Retirement
In the event of the retirement of an NEO, in addition to the items identified above, the executive will:
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability
In the event of the death or disability of an NEO, in addition to the benefits listed under the previous three headings, the executive will receive benefits under our disability plan or payments under our group life insurance plan and executive life insurance plan, as appropriate. In addition, pursuant to our 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan and previous stock benefit plans, upon death or disability, the executive would become immediately vested in all outstanding RSUs, performance shares and stock options.
Payments Made Upon a Change in Control
Prior CIC Letter Agreements. The Company was a party to Tier I or Tier II change in control letter agreements (the "CIC Letter Agreements") with each of the NEOs except Messrs. Begor, Farshchi and Koehler. As described above, the CIC Letter Agreements were replaced in their entirety by the CIC Plan and are no longer of any force or effect.
The CIC Letter Agreements provided that if an executive's employment is terminated within three or two (depending on whether a Tier I or Tier II agreement) years following a change in control (other than termination by the Company for cause or by reason of death or disability), or if the executive terminates his or her employment in certain circumstances defined in the CIC Letter Agreement which constitute "good reason," the NEO will receive:
Generally, pursuant to the CIC Letter Agreements, a change in control is deemed to occur upon:
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    64
"Good reason" under the CIC Letter Agreements means (i) a reduction in the executive's base salary or material diminution of annual bonus opportunity, or failure to continue in effect benefits under the Company's retirement compensation or other benefit plans; (ii) a requirement that the executive be based at a location more than 35 miles from his or her principal work location prior to the change of control; or (iii) assignment of duties inconsistent with his or her position prior to the change of control, or a substantial change in the nature of the executive's responsibilities. "Cause" generally means the executive has (a) willfully failed to substantially perform his or her duties to us (other than resulting from physical incapacity or mental illness) or (b) willfully engaged in misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company.
Under the CIC Letter Agreements for Messrs. Gamble, Kelley and Barros, benefits payable under their respective CIC Letter Agreement and other Company compensation or benefit plans were not reduced to satisfy the limits of Code Section 280G, or similar state or local tax imposed on such payments. Further, any payments Mr. Barros would have received were increased, if necessary, so that after taking into account all taxes Mr. Barros would incur as a result of those payments, he would receive the same after-tax amount he would have received had no excise tax been imposed under Code Section 4999. The CIC Letter Agreements for Messrs. Gamble and Kelley did not provide for such payments.
The CIC Agreements added confidentiality provisions during the NEO's employment and for two years after termination of employment. The agreement also subjected the NEO to certain non-compete and non-solicitation obligations during the term of employment with the Company and for a one-year period following termination of employment.
2019 Change in Control Severance Plan. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted the Equifax Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan ("CIC Plan"). The CIC Plan applies to each of our NEOs, except Mr. Begor whose severance benefits upon a change in control are contained in his employment agreement (see "CEO Employment Agreement" on page 46).
The Compensation Committee adopted the CIC Plan to ensure a uniform set of provisions among participating NEOs that is aligned with best practices. The CIC Plan supports the creation of shareholder value by mitigating economic anxiety that could arise due to uncertainty about future job continuity, which is intended to ensure the delivery of an intact leadership team to the successor organization and focus the team on shareholder objectives rather than how the outcome may affect them personally. The CIC Plan is not intended to replace or affect other compensation elements.
The CIC Plan provides the participating NEOs with severance benefits in the event that (i) a "change on control" of the Company occurs, and (ii) within 6 months prior to or within 24 months after the change in control, a participating NEO is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the NEO for "good reason" (referred to as a "CIC Qualifying Termination"). If a CIC Qualifying Termination occurs, the NEO is eligible to receive:
Severance payments to an NEO are generally capped such that the payments will be reduced to satisfy the "parachute payment" limits of Code Section 280G.
Pursuant to the CIC Plan, a "change in control" is deemed to occur upon:
Under the terms of the CIC Plan, the participating NEOs become subject to standard definitions of "Cause" and "Good Reason" that align with contemporary best practices and severance benefits become subject to the Company's enhanced compensation clawback policy. An NEO can be terminated for "cause" as a result of: (i) conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other serious crime involving moral turpitude; (ii) willful misconduct that is materially injurious to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (whether financially, reputationally, or otherwise); (iii) willful and continued failure of an NEO to perform his or her duties and responsibilities (other than as a result of physical or mental illness or injury) after receipt of written notice of such failure, provided that the NEO shall have 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice in which to cure such failure (to the extent cure is possible); (iv) gross negligence in managing the material risks of the Company or its subsidiaries; (v) material breach of the CIC Plan or of the restrictive covenants after receipt of written notice of such breach, provided, that the NEO shall have 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice in which to cure such breach (to the extent cure is possible); or (vi) material violations of law or the Company's Code of Conduct or insider trading policy, any of which results in material financial or reputational harm to the Company. An NEO can terminate his or her employment for "good reason" based upon (i) a material adverse change in the NEO's duties, authority, or responsibilities; (ii) a material reduction in
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    65
the NEO's base salary (which for purposes of the CIC Plan shall mean a reduction of 10% or more) or the target percentage of base salary under the Annual Incentive Plan; (iii) a material reduction in the value of the NEO's annual equity or long term incentive award opportunity; (iv) a relocation of the NEO's primary work location of more than 35 miles; or (v) the material breach by the Company of the terms of the CIC Plan.
In order to be eligible to receive severance benefits, the NEO must execute a release of claims against the Company and comply with confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants. In addition, severance benefits are subject to the Company's clawback policy.
The following table highlights differences between certain provisions of the CIC Letter Agreements and the CIC Plan:

[END TABLE]
Change in Control and Termination Provisions of Other Plans
Annual Incentive Plan. Under the AIP, which is established pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, an NEO would forfeit his or her award if he or she voluntarily terminated his or her employment other than for "good reason" (as defined in the plan) prior to year-end or if he or she is terminated by us for "cause" (as defined in the plan). However, the executive would receive a pro rata award under the plan if the executive's employment is terminated prior to year-end as a result of death, disability, normal retirement or full early retirement or if the executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause. If there is a change in control event and an NEO is terminated without cause or terminates for "good reason," payments for annual incentive opportunities would be made to the executive in the manner described under "Payments Made Upon a Change in Control" beginning on page 64.
2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Although subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee, under the 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan and applicable award agreements, stock option grants have historically provided that options are not exercisable after a participant terminates employment with the Company, unless the termination was the result of the participant's death, disability, retirement or job elimination. Under the plan, an executive's stock options which have not yet been exercised will become immediately vested and exercisable and RSUs and performance shares will vest if a change in control (as defined in such plan) of the Company occurs while such executive is an employee of the Company.
Double-Trigger Change in Control Provisions. Beginning in 2017, equity awards to our NEOs include a "double-trigger" change-in-control provision to limit accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control of Equifax to those situations where an executive is terminated without cause, the executive terminates for good reason or the acquirer fails to assume the awards. We also have double-trigger structures in place for other aspects of our compensation program.
Rabbi Trust. We maintain a trust agreement with an independent trustee establishing a springing rabbi trust for the purpose of funding benefits payable to participants (including participating NEOs) under our SERP. The trust is a grantor trust, irrevocable except in the event of an unfavorable ruling by the IRS as to the tax status of the trust or certain changes in tax law. It is currently funded with a nominal amount of cash. Future contributions will be made to the grantor trust if and when required by the provisions of the trust or at the discretion of the Company. If there is a change in control, the grantor trust must be fully funded, within 10 days following the change in control, with an amount equal to the entire benefit to which each participant would be entitled under the covered plan as of the date of the change in control (calculated on the basis of the present value of the projected future benefits payable under the covered plan). "Change in Control" is defined in substantially the same manner as in the change in control agreements described under "Payments Made Upon a Change in Control," except that there is no "double trigger" and, for a stock acquisition above a threshold of 20% of the outstanding voting shares of the Company and below the 50% level, the Compensation Committee has discretion to determine whether the trust should be funded. The assets of the grantor trust are required to be held separate and apart from the other funds of Equifax and its subsidiaries, but remain subject to the claims of general creditors under applicable state and federal law.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The table below sets forth the compensation received by our non-management directors during 2018:
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE
Director Fees. Director cash compensation in 2018 consisted of an annual cash retainer of $90,000 and an annual cash retainer of $27,500 for the Audit Committee Chair, $22,500 for the Compensation Committee Chair, and $15,000 each for the Chairs of the Governance and Technology Committees. An annual cash retainer is also paid, in the amount of $15,000 for Audit Committee members, $12,500 for Compensation Committee members and $7,500 for all other Committee members. An annual cash retainer of $50,000 was paid to Mr. Feidler as Independent Chairman. An annual cash retainer was paid to members of the Special Committee formed after the 2017 cybersecurity incident, consisting of $22,500 for the Chair and $15,000 for each other member, until the Special Committee's dissolution in September 2018. Effective January 1, 2019, the annual cash retainers for the Technology Committee Chair and members was increased to $27,500 and $15,000 respectively, and the annual cash retainer for Mr. Feidler as Independent Chairman was increased to $100,000.
By paying directors an annual retainer, the Company compensates each non-management director for his or her role and judgment as an advisor to the Company, rather than for his or her attendance or effort at individual meetings. Directors with added responsibility are recognized with higher cash compensation as noted above.
Equity Awards. Each non-management director receives an initial and an annual long-term incentive grant of RSUs under our shareholder-approved 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders to further align their interests with those of our shareholders and to attract and retain highly-qualified directors through equity ownership. For 2018, directors received a fixed value in shares, computed as of the grant date ($175,000 for initial one-time grant to new directors and $170,000 for annual grant). The annual grants and initial grants vest one year and three years, respectively, after the grant date with accelerated vesting in the event of the director's death, disability, retirement or a change in control of the Company. RSUs granted in 2017 and later accrue dividend equivalent units. 
Director Deferred Compensation Plan.Each non-management director may defer receipt of up to 100% of his or her stock-based or cash retainer fees. The director is credited with a number of share units having an equivalent value at the end of each quarter based on his or her advance deferral election. Share units are equivalent to shares of the Company's common stock, except that share units have no voting rights and do not receive dividend credit. In general, amounts deferred are not paid until the director retires from the Board. However, directors may also establish sub-accounts from which amounts are to be paid on specific pre-retirement timetables established by the director. At the end of the applicable deferral period, the director receives a share of common stock for each share unit awarded. Such shares are received either in a lump sum or over a period not to exceed 15 years for retirement distributions, or up to five years for a scheduled withdrawal, as elected in advance by each director.
Director and Executive Stock Deferral Plan.Each director may defer up to 100% of his or her annual RSU grant, including dividend equivalent units, plus taxes otherwise due upon the vesting of RSUs. Due to changes in federal tax laws, no deferral elections for stock options are currently permitted under the plan. The director is credited with a number of share units as of the vesting date based on his or her advance deferral election. In general, amounts deferred under the plan are not paid until the director retires from the Board. However, directors may also establish sub-accounts from which amounts are to be paid on specific pre-retirement timetables established by the director. Amounts deferred are paid in shares of our common stock, at the director's option, either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 15 years for retirement distributions, or up to five years for a scheduled withdrawal. We make no contributions to this plan, but we pay all costs and expenses incurred in its administration.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent shareholders also are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based upon a review of copies of such forms furnished to the Company and written representations provided by the reporting persons, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were timely met in 2018.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Company's financial statements, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and procedures that are reasonably designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling our oversight responsibilities, we have reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. We reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young the quarterly financial statements for each quarter in such fiscal year, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, Ernst & Young's evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date, and audit plans and results. We have also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed with the independent auditor by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the PCAOB.
We have received from Ernst & Young the written disclosures required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and have discussed with Ernst & Young its independence. We have also considered whether the provision of specific non-audit services by Ernst & Young is compatible with maintaining its independence and believe that the services provided by Ernst & Young for fiscal year 2018 were compatible with, and did not impair, its independence.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Submitted on February 19, 2019 by the Audit Committee:
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    72
The Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, and the Board is asking shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current laws, rules, and regulations, as well as the charter of the Audit Committee, require the Audit Committee to engage, retain, and supervise the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Board considers the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter of shareholder concern and is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. Additionally, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the Audit Firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chair are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young's new lead engagement partner. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee will review the Company's relationship with Ernst & Young and take such action as it deems appropriate, which may include continuing to retain Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
Ernst & Young has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. A representative of Ernst & Young will be available during the meeting to make a statement if such representative desires to do so and to respond to appropriate questions.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
The following table sets forth the fees of Ernst & Young for services rendered to the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    73
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Company maintains a pre-approval policy that mandates that the Audit Committee approve the audit and non-audit services in advance. All audit and non-audit services for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were either pre-approved by the Audit Committee or were approved pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy. The Audit Committee has authorized its Chair to pre-approve certain permissible audit and non-audit services that arise between Audit Committee meetings, provided the Audit Committee is informed of the decision to pre-approve the services at its next scheduled meeting. In its pre-approval of non-audit services and fees, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has determined that performance of services other than audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. See "Audit Committee Report" on page 72.
To avoid potential conflicts of interest in maintaining auditor independence, the law prohibits a publicly traded company from obtaining certain non-audit services from its independent registered public accounting firm. In 2018 and 2017, we did not obtain any of these prohibited services from Ernst & Young. The Company uses other accounting firms for these types of non-audit services.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 3.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    74
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
Do I need an admission ticket to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting?
Only Equifax shareholders as of the record date are entitled to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. To attend, shareholders must present proof of stock ownership and a valid photo ID. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record (also known as "street name") and you wish to attend the meeting, you must present proof of ownership as of the record date, such as the voting instruction card that is sent to you or a current bank or brokerage account statement, to be admitted. The Company also may request appropriate identification, such as a valid government-issued photo identification as a condition of admission. Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, cellular telephones, smartphones or other similar equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will not be allowed in the meeting room. You will be required to enter through a security checkpoint before being granted access to the venue.
Who is entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting?
Company shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual meeting. As of such date, there were 121,364,982 shares of Company common stock outstanding, each entitled to one vote.
What is the difference between holding shares as a registered shareholder and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered the "registered stockholder" of those shares. We mail the proxy materials and our Annual Report to you directly.
If your shares are held in street name with a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of the shares that are registered in street name. In this case, the proxy materials and our Annual Report will be forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions included in the material.
Employees with shares allocated in an employee benefit plan account will vote shares allocated to their benefit plan account electronically and will not receive a paper mailing for those shares. Employees should review the information on procedures for voting by employees on page 77.
What am I voting on and what are the Board's voting recommendations?
Can other matters be decided at the 2019 Annual Meeting?
The Company is not aware, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, of any other matters to be voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting for a vote, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote all shares represented at the meeting (other than shares that are voted by the holder in person at the meeting) on such matters in accordance with the Board's recommendation.

What is the procedure for voting?
Shareholders of record
Shareholders of record may attend and cast their votes at the 2019 Annual Meeting. For security reasons, please be prepared to show photo identification. If you need special assistance because of a disability, please contact Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, or telephone (404) 885-8000.
In addition, shareholders of record may cast their vote by proxy and participants in the Company's benefit plans described on page 77 may submit their voting instructions by: 
Votes cast through the Internet and telephone voting procedures are authenticated by use of a personal identification number. This procedure allows shareholders to appoint a proxy (or Company benefit plan participants to provide voting instructions) and to confirm that their actions have been properly recorded. Specific instructions to be followed are set forth on the proxy materials email or proxy card (if you received one).
Beneficial owners
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction form provided to you by them, or by following their instructions for voting through the Internet or by telephone. In the alternative, you may vote in person at the meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and present it at the meeting. In order for your shares to be voted on all matters presented at the meeting, we urge all shareholders whose shares are held in street name by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to provide voting instructions to such record holder.
Can I change my proxy vote?
Yes. If you are a registered shareholder, you can change your proxy vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the 2019 Annual Meeting by:
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you can submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other nominee. You can also vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee (the registered shareholder) as described in the answer to the previous question.
Your personal attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting does not revoke your proxy. Unless you vote at the meeting in person, your last valid proxy prior to or at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be used to cast your vote.
What if I return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions?
Proxies that are signed and returned but do not contain voting instructions will be voted: 
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    76
How do I vote if I participate in one of the Company's 401(k) or defined contribution plans?
Participants in the Equifax Inc. 401(k) Plan and the Equifax Canada Retirement Savings Program for Salaried Employees (collectively, the "Company Plans") may instruct the applicable plan trustee how to vote all shares of Company common stock allocated to their accounts. To allow sufficient time for the plan trustees to vote, the trustees must receive your voting instructions no later than 11:59 p.m., Atlanta Time, on April 30, 2019. The 401(k) Plan trustee will vote shares for which it has not received instructions in the same proportion as the shares for which it has received instructions. The Canada Retirement Savings Program trustee will only vote those plan shares for which voting instructions are received prior to this deadline. Participants in the Company Plans may not vote the shares owned through such plans after this deadline, including at the Annual Meeting.
How many shares must be present to hold the 2019 Annual Meeting?
In order for us to lawfully conduct business at our 2019 Annual Meeting, a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote as of March 1, 2019 must be present in person or represented by proxy. This is referred to as a quorum. Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy by Internet, by telephone, or by mail in advance of the meeting and do not revoke the proxy. If a quorum is not present, the meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is present.
Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy or instruction card?
Registered Shareholders
If your shares are registered in your name, your shares will not be voted unless you provide a proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, or vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Plan Participants
If you are a participant in one of our employee 401(k) or defined contribution plans and you do not provide timely instructions to the plan trustee, shares allocated to your account(s) will be voted by the plan trustee depending on the terms of your plan and other legal requirements.
Beneficial Owners
If you hold shares through an account with a broker and you do not provide voting instructions, under NYSE rules, your broker may vote your shares on routine matters only. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (Proposal 3) is considered a routine matter, and your nominee can therefore vote your shares on that proposal even if you do not provide voting instructions. Proposals 1 and 2 are not considered routine matters, and your nominee cannot vote your shares on these proposals unless you provide voting instructions. Votes withheld by brokers in the absence of voting instructions from a beneficial owner are referred to as "broker non-votes."
Multiple Forms of Ownership
The Company cannot provide a single proxy or instruction card for shareholders who own shares in different forms of accounts (employee benefit plan shares, registered shares, and beneficially-owned shares). As a result, if your shares are held in multiple types of accounts, you must submit your votes for each type of account in accordance with the instructions you receive for that account.
What is the vote required for each proposal?
For Proposal 1, Election of Director Nominees, each director nominee for whom more shares are voted "for" than "against" his or her election will be elected as a director at the meeting. Under our Bylaws, if more votes are cast "against" than are cast "for" a nominee, the nominee shall offer his or her resignation. The independent members of the Board will determine and promptly publicly announce the action to be taken with respect to acceptance or rejection of the resignation offer.
For each of Proposal 2, Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation and Proposal 3, Ratification of Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019, the proposal will be approved if more votes are cast "for" than are cast "against" the proposal. Proposals 2 and 3 are advisory and nonbinding. The Board will review the voting results on these proposals and take the results into account when making future decisions regarding these matters. "Votes cast" exclude abstentions and broker non-votes.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    77
What is the effect of an abstention?
A shareholder who abstains on some or all matters is considered present for purposes of determining if a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, but an abstention is not counted as a vote cast. An abstention has no effect for the vote on any proposal.
What is the effect of a broker non-vote?
Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal. Thus, a broker non-vote will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum, will not affect the outcome with respect to the election of directors, and will not otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on a proposal that requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
Who will count the votes?
A representative of Broadridge Financial Services will tabulate the votes and act as independent inspector of election for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Where can I find the voting results of the 2019 Annual Meeting?
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and disclosed by the Company in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the 2019 Annual Meeting.
What is "householding" and how does it affect me?
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, we send only one Annual Report and Proxy Statement to eligible shareholders who share a single address, unless we have received instructions to the contrary from any shareholder at that address. The practice is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to separately vote their proxies. We do not use householding for any other shareholder mailings, such as dividend checks, Form 1099, or account information statements.
If you are eligible for householding, but received multiple copies of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement and prefer to receive only a single copy for your household, please contact Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, telephone (404) 885-8000. If you are a registered shareholder residing at an address with other registered shareholders and wish to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement at this time or in the future, we will provide you with a separate copy. To obtain this copy, please contact the Office of Corporate Secretary. If you own shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should contact the nominee concerning householding procedures.
The Company cannot provide a single proxy or voting instruction card for shareholders who own shares in different forms of accounts (employee benefit plan shares, registered shares, and beneficially-owned shares). Accordingly, you will receive a separate solicitation and proxy for each type of account in which shares are held and you must submit your votes for each type of account in accordance with the instructions received for that account.
Can I receive a copy of the Annual Report?
Yes. We will provide a copy of our Annual Report without charge, upon written request, to any registered or beneficial owner of common stock entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Requests should be made in writing addressed to the Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, or by calling (404) 885-8000.
EQUIFAX INC. - 2019 Proxy Statement    78
Can I view the Proxy Statement and Annual Report on the Internet?
Yes. The Proxy Statement and Annual Report are available on the Internet at https://investor.equifax.com/financial-information/annual-reports-and-proxy-statements. Most shareholders will receive their annual meeting materials via electronic delivery. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding Equifax.
Can I choose to receive the Proxy Statement and Annual Report on the Internet instead of receiving them by mail?
Yes. If you are a registered shareholder or beneficial owner, you can elect to receive future annual reports and proxy statements on the Internet only and not receive copies in the mail by following the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form. Your request for electronic transmission will remain in effect for all future annual reports and proxy statements, unless withdrawn. Most active employees who participate in the Company's savings plans will receive an online notification announcing Internet availability of the annual report and proxy statement; a paper copy will not be provided unless requested by following the instructions in the email notification.
Who pays the cost of this proxy solicitation?
The Company has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in soliciting proxies for an annual fee of $20,000 plus expenses, and will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Directors, officers and other Company associates also may solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise. Brokers and other nominees will be requested to solicit proxies or authorizations from beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses.
How do I submit a proposal or director nominee for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
Notice of any proposal or director nomination, including through our proxy access procedures, that a shareholder wishes to propose for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including any proposal that a shareholder wishes to submit for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting, must be delivered to us no later than November 23, 2019 (and, in the case of a director nomination pursuant to proxy access, no earlier than October 24, 2019). The proposal or director nomination must satisfy the information and other requirements specified in our Bylaws which are available at: www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance and, if to be included in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting, must comply with SEC Rule 14a-8 and other applicable rules and interpretations of the SEC.
Any shareholder proposal or director nomination submitted to the Company in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting should be addressed to: Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302. In addition, the shareholder proponent or a duly authorized representative must appear in person at the 2020 Annual Meeting to present the proposal.
How can I contact the Company's directors?
Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with our directors, a committee of the Board of Directors, the Independent Chairman, the non-management directors as a group, or the Board generally should address their correspondence accordingly and send by mail to Equifax Inc., c/o Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302. Correspondence will be forwarded as directed by the shareholder. The Company may first review such communications and screen out solicitations for goods and services and similar inappropriate communications unrelated to the Company or its business. All concerns related to audit or accounting matters will be referred to the Audit Committee.
Can I find additional information on the Company's website?
Yes. Although information contained on our website is not part of this Proxy Statement, you will find information about the Company and our corporate governance practices at www.equifax.com/about-equifax/corporate-governance. Our website contains information about our Board, Board committees, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Governance Guidelines, and information about insider transactions. Shareholders may obtain, without charge, hard copies of the above documents by writing to Equifax Inc., Attn: Office of Corporate Secretary, P.O. Box 4081, Atlanta, Georgia 30302, telephone (404) 885-8000.
