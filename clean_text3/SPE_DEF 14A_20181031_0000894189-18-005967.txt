PROXY STATEMENT FOR
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 6, PROXY STATEMENT
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Special Opportunities Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on December 6, 2018, at 10:30 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of Blank Rome LLP, 405 Lexington Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10174, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof.  A form of proxy for each of the holders of shares of the Fund's common and preferred stock (the "Stockholders") is enclosed herewith.  This Proxy Statement and accompanying forms of proxy are being first mailed to Stockholders on or about October 31, 2018.
For a proposal requiring the vote of holders of common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class, the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of common stock and preferred stock entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting (i.e., the presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Fund on the record date, October 18, 2018) is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  For a proposal requiring a vote by holders of preferred stock, voting separately as a class, the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of preferred stock entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting (i.e., the presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock of the Fund on the record date, October 18, 2018) is necessary to constitute a quorum for such proposal.  In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposals are not received, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting, or the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to a date not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the original record date to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy.  A Stockholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is otherwise appropriate.  The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that they are entitled to vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" any such proposal in their discretion.
Stockholders can vote by Internet by going to the following website address, www.voteproxy.com; by telephone by calling 1-800-776-9437; or by mail by completing the proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided.  If the enclosed proxy is executed and returned, or an internet or telephonic vote is delivered, that vote may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written notification received by the Fund, by the execution of a later-dated proxy, by the Fund's receipt of a subsequent valid internet or telephonic vote, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.  To be effective, such revocation must be received by the Fund prior to the Meeting and must indicate the Stockholder's name and account number.  Unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the specifications therein and, unless specified to the contrary, will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees for Director.  In general, abstentions and broker non-votes (reflected by signed but unvoted proxies), as defined below, count for purposes of obtaining a quorum but do not count as votes cast with respect to any proposal where the broker does not have discretion.  With respect to a proposal requiring the affirmative vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares of common stock or preferred stock, the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes is the same as a vote against such proposal.  Otherwise, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on a proposal requiring a plurality of votes cast for approval (i.e., Proposals 1(a) and 1(b)) or on a proposal which requires a majority of the votes validly cast.  Broker non-votes occur when shares, held in the name of the broker or nominees for whom an executed proxy is received by the Fund, are not voted on a proposal because voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power.
Only holders of issued and outstanding shares of the Fund's stock of record on the close of business on October 18, 2018 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting.  Each such holder is entitled to one vote per share of common stock and one vote per share of preferred stock so held on October 18, 2018, there were 8,500,968 shares of the Fund's common stock issued and outstanding and 2,223,976 shares of the Fund's preferred stock issued and outstanding.  The Fund is a closed-end, management investment company.
A copy of the Fund's most recent semi-annual report for the period ended June 30, 2018 and the Fund's most recent annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 may be obtained by visiting the Fund's website at www.specialopportunitiesfundinc.com or may be ordered free of charge by any Stockholder by writing to the Fund c/o U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or by telephone at 1-877-607-0414.  These reports are also available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") website at www.sec.gov.  The Fund's most recent semi-annual report was mailed to Stockholders on August 29, 2018. Required Vote for Adoption of Proposals.
Proposal 1(a) (to elect four Directors to the Fund's Board of Directors, to be elected by the holders of the Fund's common stock and preferred stock, voting together as a single class, to serve until the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified) requires the affirmative vote of a plurality (i.e., a simple majority of the votes cast at the meeting) of the votes cast at the Meeting by the holders of the Fund's common stock and preferred stock, in person or by proxy, on such Proposal, provided a quorum is present.
Proposal 1(b) (to elect two Directors to the Fund's Board of Directors, to be elected by the holders of the Fund's preferred stock, voting as a separate class, to serve until the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified) requires the affirmative vote of a plurality (i.e., a simple majority of the votes cast at the meeting) of the votes cast at the Meeting by the holders of the Fund's preferred stock, in person or by proxy, on such Proposal, provided a quorum is present. PROPOSAL 1(A) AND (B):  TO ELECT SIX DIRECTORS TO THE FUND'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
FOUR OF WHICH ARE TO BE ELECTED BY THE HOLDERS OF THE FUND'S COMMON STOCK
AND PREFERRED STOCK, AND TWO OF WHICH ARE TO BE ELECTED BY THE HOLDERS OF
THE FUND'S PREFERRED STOCK, IN EACH CASE TO SERVE UNTIL THE FUND'S NEXT ANNUAL
MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS IN 2019 AND UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSORS HAVE BEEN DULY
ELECTED AND QUALIFIED
The Board of Directors is ordinarily comprised of six Directors.  Proposal 1(a) relates to the election of four Directors, which Directors are to be elected by the holders of the Fund's common stock ("Common Stockholders") and preferred stock ("Preferred Stockholders"), voting together as a single class.  The Board of Directors has nominated Andrew Dakos, Gerald Hellerman, Charles Walden and Ben Harris to be elected by the Common Stockholders and the Preferred Stockholders.  Each of Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden and Harris  currently serves on the Board of Directors.  
Proposal 1(b) relates to the election of two Directors, which Directors are to be elected by the Preferred Stockholders, voting as a separate class.  The Board of Directors has nominated Phillip Goldstein and Marc Lunder to be elected by the Preferred Stockholders.  Each of Messrs. Goldstein and Lunder currently serves on the Board of Directors.
In the event that one or all of the nominees become unavailable for election for any presently unforeseen reason, the persons named in the form of proxy will vote for any successor nominee who shall be designated by the present Board of Directors.  
At the Meeting, the Stockholders will be asked to vote for the election of Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden, Goldstein, Harris and Lunder.  If elected, Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden, Goldstein, Harris and Lunder will each serve until the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019 or thereafter until each of their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  If elected, Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden, Goldstein, Harris and Lunder have each consented to serve as Director of the Fund until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
The persons named in the accompanying forms of proxy intend to vote at the Meeting (unless directed not to vote) "FOR" the election of Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden, Goldstein, Harris and Lunder.  The nominees named above have indicated that they will serve if elected, and the Board of Directors has no reason to believe that the nominees will become unavailable for election as Directors; however, if Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden, Goldstein, Harris and Lunder should be unable to serve, the proxy will be voted for any other persons determined by the persons named in the accompanying forms of proxy in accordance with their judgment.
Required Vote.  Messrs. Dakos, Hellerman, Walden and Harris must each be elected by a plurality (i.e., a simple majority of the votes cast at the Meeting) of the votes cast by the Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders, voting together as a single class, present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present.  Messrs. Goldstein and Lunder must each be elected by a plurality (i.e., a simple majority of the votes cast at the Meeting) of the votes cast by the Preferred Stockholders, voting as a separate class, present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for quorum purposes, but otherwise will have no effect on the plurality vote required for each Director.  Directors and Officers
 Set forth below are the Directors, nominees for Directors and officers of the Fund, and their respective ages, business addresses, positions and terms of office, principal occupations during the past five years, and other directorships held by them at October 18, 2018.  Messrs. Harris, Walden and Lunder are each not considered an "interested person" of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (each an "Independent Director").  Mr. Hellerman is considered an "interested person" of the Fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act (an "Interested Director") because he serves as the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer; however, he is not considered to be an "interested person" of the Adviser.  Messrs. Dakos and Goldstein are each considered Interested Directors because of their affiliation with the Adviser and their positions as officers of the Fund.  In the past 10 years, there have been no legal proceedings against any of the directors, nominees or officers and none that are pending.

The Board believes that the significance of each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience that is important for one Director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the Board level, with no single Director, or particular factor, being indicative of the Board's effectiveness.  The Board currently does not have a formal diversity policy in place.  The Board determined that each of the Directors is qualified to serve as a Director of the Fund based on a review of the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each Director.  In reaching this determination, the Board has considered a variety of criteria, including, among other things: character and integrity; ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided, to exercise effective business judgment in protecting stockholder interests and to interact effectively with the other Directors, the Adviser, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm ("independent auditors"); and willingness and ability to commit the time necessary to perform the duties of a Director.  Each Director's ability to perform his duties effectively is evidenced by his experience or achievements in the following areas: management or board experience in the investment management industry or companies in other fields, educational background and professional training; and experience as a Director of the Fund.  Information as of October 18, 2018 indicating the specific experience, skills, attributes and qualifications of each Director which led to the Board's determination that the Director should serve in this capacity is provided below.

[END TABLE]
Specific details regarding each Director's principal occupations during the past five years are included in the table above. The summaries set forth above as to the experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills of the Directors do not constitute holding out the Board or any Director as having any special expertise or experience, and do not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board as a whole than would otherwise be the case.
Board Composition and Leadership Structure. The Board currently consists of six individuals, two of whom are Interested Directors of the Adviser, and one of whom is an Interested Director of the Fund but not of the Adviser.  The Chairman of the Board, Mr. Goldstein, is an Interested Director and is the Secretary of the Fund and is a principal of the Adviser.  The Board does not have a lead independent director.
The Board believes that its structure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Directors from the Adviser and other service providers with respect to services provided to the Fund, potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships and other risks that the Fund may face.  The Board further believes that its structure allows all of the Directors to participate in the full range of the Board's oversight responsibilities.  The Board believes that the orderly and efficient flow of information and the ability to bring each Director's talents to bear in overseeing the Fund's operations is important, in light of the size and complexity of the Fund and the risks that the Fund faces.  Based on each Director's experience and expertise with closed-end funds the Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate and efficient. The Board and its committees review their structures regularly, to help ensure that they remain appropriate as the business and operations of the Fund, and the environment in which the Fund operates, changes.
Currently, the Board has an Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Valuation Committee.  The responsibilities of each committee and its members are described below.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight of the Fund.  The Board oversees risk management for the Fund directly and, as to certain matters, through its committees.  The Board exercises its oversight in this regard primarily through requesting and receiving reports from and otherwise working with the Fund's senior officers (including the Fund's President, Chief Compliance Officer and Treasurer), portfolio management and other personnel of the Adviser, the Fund's independent auditors, legal counsel and personnel from the Fund's other service providers.  The Board has adopted, on behalf of the Fund, and periodically reviews with the assistance of the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, policies and procedures designed to address certain risks associated with the Fund's activities.  In addition, the Adviser and the Fund's other service providers also have adopted policies, processes and procedures designed to identify, assess and manage certain risks associated with the Fund's activities, and the Board receives reports from service providers with respect to the operation of these policies, processes and procedures as required and/or as the Board deems appropriate. Compensation of Directors.  The Board does not have a standing compensation committee.  Currently, each Independent Director and Mr. Hellerman receives an annual retainer equal to $40,000 for serving as a Director and attending the quarterly meetings of the Board, paid quarterly in arrears, plus $1,000 for each special Board meeting attended in person (or $500 if attended by telephone).  The Independent Directors and Mr. Hellerman receive $500 for special committee meetings held in between regularly scheduled Board meetings. As additional annual compensation, the Audit Committee Chairman and Valuation Committee Chairman receives $5,000, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Chairman receives $3,000.  Each Independent Director is entitled to receive such compensation for any partial quarter for which he serves.
Directors who are "interested persons" of the Adviser will not receive any compensation for their services as Directors.  The Fund does not have a bonus, profit sharing, pension or retirement plan.  No other entity affiliated with the Fund pays any compensation to the Directors.  The table below details the amount of compensation the Fund's Directors received from the Fund during the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
Code of Ethics.  The Fund and the Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Section 204A and Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions.  Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Fund, so long as such investments are made pursuant to the code's requirements.  Copies of these codes are available for inspection at the Public Reference Room of the SEC in Washington, D.C.  Information regarding the operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090.  Copies of the Fund's and the Adviser's codes of ethics are also available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, and may also be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.
Management Ownership.  To the knowledge of the Fund's management, as of October 18, 2018, the Directors and officers of the Fund beneficially owned, as a group, less than 2% of the shares of the Fund's common and preferred stock.  The following table sets forth the aggregate dollar range of equity securities in the Fund that is owned by each Director, nominee for Director and officer as of October 18, 2018.

Director Transactions with Fund Affiliates.  As of December 31, 2017, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family owned securities beneficially or of record in the Adviser or any of its affiliates. Furthermore, over the past five years, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family have had any direct or indirect interest, the value of which exceeds $120,000, in the Adviser or any of its affiliates. In addition, since the beginning of the last two fiscal years, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family have conducted any transactions (or series of transactions) or maintained any direct or indirect relationship in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and to which the Adviser or any of its affiliates was a party.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, RECOMMENDS
THAT PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 1(B) FOR ELECTION OF EACH OF
THE NOMINEES FOR PREFERRED DIRECTOR. ANY SIGNED BUT UNMARKED PROXIES WILL BE
SO VOTED "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES. Additional Information about the Board of Directors
Board Meetings and Committees.
During the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, each present Director and nominee for Director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the Committees of which he is a member, held since his respective election.  During the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, the Board met three times.
Audit Committee. The Board has established an Audit Committee that acts pursuant to a written charter (the "Audit Committee Charter") and whose responsibilities are generally: (i) to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Fund and its internal control over financial reporting and, as the Audit Committee deems appropriate, to inquire into the internal control over financial reporting of certain third-party providers; (ii) to oversee the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements and the independent audit thereof; (iii) to oversee, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Fund's accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits; (iv) to approve prior to appointment the engagement of the Fund's independent auditors and, in connection therewith, to review and evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the Fund's independent auditors; and (v) to act as liaison between the Fund's independent auditors and the full Board.
Although the Audit Committee is expected to take a detached and questioning approach to the matters that come before it, the review of the Fund's financial statements by the Audit Committee is not an audit, nor does the Audit Committee's review substitute for the responsibilities of the Fund's management for preparing, or the independent auditors for auditing, the financial statements.  Members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Fund and, in serving on the Audit Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors.  As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews.  In discharging their duties, the members of the Audit Committee are entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers of the Fund whom such Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or (3) a Board committee of which the Director is not a member.
The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Harris, Walden and Lunder.  None of the members of the Audit Committee has any relationship to the Fund that may interfere with the exercise of his independence from management of the Fund, and each is independent as defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") applicable to closed-end funds.  Mr. Walden is the Chairman of the Audit Committee. During the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, the Board's Audit Committee met two times.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board has also established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that acts pursuant to a written charter (the "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter").  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, identifying and selecting qualified individuals to become Board members and members of Board committees and developing, adopting and periodically monitoring and updating the Fund's corporate governance principles and policies.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of Messrs. Harris, Walden and Lunder. None of the members is an "interested person" for purposes of the 1940 Act, and each is independent as defined under listing standards of the NYSE applicable to closed-end funds.  Mr. Lunder is the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  During the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018, the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met one time.   In nominating candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that no specific qualifications or disqualifications are controlling or paramount, and that there are no specific qualities or skills necessary for each candidate to possess. In identifying and evaluating nominees for Director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate.  These factors may include: (i) whether or not the person is an "interested person" as defined in the 1940 Act, meets the independence and experience requirements of the NYSE applicable to closed-end funds and is otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a member of the Board; (ii) whether or not the person has any relationships that might impair his or her independence, such as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund management, the investment adviser and/or sub-adviser of the Fund, Fund service providers or their affiliates; (iii) whether or not the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for the performance of the duties of a Board member; (iv) the person's judgment, skill, diversity and experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight; (v) the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board members; and (vi) the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committees thereof.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by Stockholders if a vacancy occurs.  In order to recommend a nominee, a Stockholder should send a letter to the chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o the Administrator, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, and indicate on the envelope "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee."  The Stockholder's letter should state the nominee's name, whether such nominee is to be elected by all stockholders or preferred stockholders only and should include the nominee's résumé or curriculum vitae, and must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by Stockholders.  Stockholders can send other communications to the Board, c/o the Administrator, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.
Valuation Committee.  The Board has also established a Valuation Committee.  Its purpose is to (i) review all monthly reports and any other interim reports regarding the valuation of securities in the Fund's portfolio, and (ii) review and approve the valuation of all fair valued securities.  The Valuation Committee consists of the Board's three Independent Directors, Messrs. Harris, Walden and Lunder.  Mr. Harris serves as the Chairman of the Valuation Committee.  The Valuation Committee of SPE met three times during the time period from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018. Information Concerning the Fund's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Tait, Weller & Baker LLP ("Tait Weller") audited the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and has been selected as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval
The Audit Committee Charter contains the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures.  Reproduced below is an excerpt from the Audit Committee Charter regarding such policies and procedures:
The Audit Committee shall:
approve prior to appointment the engagement of the auditor to provide other audit services to the Fund or to provide non-audit services to the Fund, its investment adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser ("adviser affiliate") that provides ongoing services to the Fund, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund.
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee has met and held discussions with the Administrator and Tait Weller.  Tait Weller represented to the Audit Committee that the Fund's financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with the Administrator and Tait Weller.  The Audit Committee also discussed with Tait Weller matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16.
Tait Weller also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), and the Audit Committee discussed with Tait Weller its independence, in light of  the services Tait Weller is providing.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussion with the Administrator and Tait Weller and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of the Administrator and the report of Tait Weller to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited financial statements in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC.

Other Matters
Historically, the Fund has asked its Stockholders to approve the process by which the Fund votes proxies received thereby from any closed end investment company in the Fund's portfolio.  The Fund will no longer include such a proposal in its annual proxy statement.  In accordance with Section 12(d)(1)(F), for each closed-end fund for which the Fund receives a proxy, the Fund (i) has sought and will continue to seek instructions from Stockholders with regard to voting such proxy and vote it in accordance with such instructions, or (ii) has voted and will continue to vote its shares of such closed-end fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other shareholders of such closed-end fund. In certain instances (e.g., if there is a contested proposal to be presented at a shareholder meeting of an underlying closed-end fund), Bulldog Investors, LLC, the adviser (the "Adviser") to the Fund may deem it appropriate to seek proxy voting instructions from Stockholders. Fund Stockholders may provide such proxy voting instructions on the Fund's website. The Fund will vote its shares of such closed-end fund as determined by a plurality of the proxy voting instructions received on the Fund's website. Stockholder Proposals
The Meeting is an annual meeting of Stockholders.  Any Stockholder who wishes to submit proposal to be considered at the Fund's next annual meeting of Stockholders in 2019 should send such proposals to the Secretary of the Fund, c/o the Administrator, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.  Stockholder proposals must be received by the Fund no later than the close of business on June 30, 2019 to receive consideration for inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials relating to that meeting under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.  Stockholder proposals that are submitted in a timely manner will not necessarily be included in the Fund's proxy materials. Inclusion of such proposals is subject to limitations under the federal securities laws and informational requirements of the Fund's Amended and Restated Bylaws, as in effect from time to time.
   In order for a stockholder to bring a proposal (other than proposals sought to be included in the Fund's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act) before the next 2019 annual meeting, such Stockholder must deliver a written notice of such proposal to the Secretary of the Fund, c/o the Administrator, 615 East Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, no later than the close of business on August 17, 2019.
Stockholders are advised to review the Fund's Amended and Restated Bylaws, which contains additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals.
Solicitation of Proxies
Your vote is being solicited by the Directors of the Fund.  The cost of soliciting these proxies will be borne by the Fund.  The Fund reimburses brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners and soliciting them to execute proxies.
The Directors and officers of the Fund may be involved in the solicitation of proxies.  The Fund does not reimburse such persons for the solicitation of proxies.  The Fund intends to pay all costs associated with the solicitation and the Meeting.  The Fund expects that the solicitation will be primarily by mail, but also may include telephone, telecopy, electronic, oral or other means of communication.
