Business Highlights 
In 2018, sales increased 8% to $4.27 billion from a combination of volume growth, raw material-related price increases and currency impact. Growth came primarily from new programs and added content in Automotive, market share and content gains in U.S. Spring, and strength in Adjustable Bed. 
The company generated $440 million of cash from operations in 2018. Profit margins were pressured throughout the year by higher raw material costs, the lag associated with passing along increased costs, and underperformance in a few of our businesses. 
We posted EPS from continuing operations of $2.26 in 2018, which included a $.19 per share charge in the fourth quarter for restructuring-related costs and impairment of a note receivable, and $.04 per share of transaction costs related to the acquisition of ECS (described below), slightly offset by a $.01 per share Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefit. For detailed results, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2019. 
We raised our dividend for the 47th consecutive year, reaching an indicated annual dividend of $1.52 per share with a 4.2% yield based on our year-end closing share price of $35.84. 
Our primary financial goal is to achieve Total Shareholder Return (TSR) that ranks in the top third of the S&P 500 over rolling 3-year periods. For more than a decade, we have been successfully executing a strategy that has enabled the company to generate strong TSR. While our performance for the past two years has not met our top-third target, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management, and use of capital will support achievement of our goal over time. 
In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions (ECS), a leader in the production of proprietary specialized foam used primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. By making this important strategic move, we have created an attractive new avenue of growth by gaining critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology, along with scale in the production of private-label finished mattresses. ECS is the largest acquisition in our history, with a purchase price of $1.25 billion. ECS's sales for fiscal year end September 2018 were $611 million. We expect ECS to generate double-digit sales growth and accretive EBITDA.

Diversity – Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee recognizes the value of cultivating a Board with a diverse mix of opinions, perspectives, skills, experiences, and backgrounds. A diverse board enables more balanced, wide-ranging discussion in the boardroom, which, we believe, enhances the decision-making processes. The matrix above reflects some aspects of the Board's diversity. In addition, four of our eight director nominees (50%) are women or racial/ethnic minorities. 
2019 Proxy Statement | Leggett & Platt      2  
Executive Compensation 
L&P seeks to align our executives' and shareholders' interests through pay-for-performance. In 2018, 84% of our CEO's target compensation was performance-based and 64% was delivered in equity-based awards, excluding the one-time transition award discussed below. 
Our compensation structure strives to strike an appropriate balance between short-term and longer-term compensation that reflects the short- and longer-term interests of the business. We believe this structure helps us attract, retain and motivate high-performing executives who will achieve outstanding results for our shareholders. 
Key Components of Our Executive Officers' 2018 Compensation Program 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Performance Metrics    Role within Compensation Program    How Designed and Determined% of 2018 CEO Pay at Target 
     Performance Metrics    Role within Compensation Program    How Designed and Determined% of 2018 CEO Pay at Target 
     Performance Metrics    Role within Compensation Program    How Designed and Determined% of 2018 CEO Pay at Target 
 Base Salary    N/A    This is the only non-performance based component of our executives' compensation. Target incentive payments and equity awards are set as a  percentage of base salary.    Our Compensation Committee reviews executive salaries annually, based on market data, peer benchmarking, individual performance and internal equity.    16% 
 Annual Incentive    Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), Cash Flow, and Individual Performance Goals    The short-term cash incentive rewards achievement of specific business targets and individual goals within the fiscal year.    The ROCE and cash flow targets are based on the Company's earnings guidance for the year. Payouts range from 0% to 150%, based upon actual performance.    20% 
 Performance Stock Units    Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and growth of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT CAGR)    Three-year relative TSR performance holds management accountable for creating and sustaining value for shareholders. Sustained EBIT growth is key to achieving our long-term TSR goals.    Relative TSR is measured against the industrial, materials and consumer discretionary sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P Midcap 400. The three-year EBIT CAGR targets are aligned with  our long-term TSR goals. Payouts range from 0% to 200%.    64% 
[END TABLE]
Changes in 2018 
Since 2013, our long-term incentive (LTI) awards have consisted of (i) the two-year Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) with vesting based upon a combination of revenue growth and EBITDA margin and (ii) the three-year Performance Stock Units (PSU) with vesting based upon relative TSR. In 2018, our LTI awards underwent the following changes to better align our compensation programs with the Company's long-term strategy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The PGI program was eliminated, and that portion of the participants' LTI was reallocated to the PSU awards, moving  from a two-year to a three-year performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The metrics for the PSU awards were modified with 50% continuing to vest based upon relative TSR and 50% now based upon  EBIT CAGR, key to achieving our long-term TSR goals.  
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement | Leggett & Platt      3  
Shifting a significant portion of our executives' LTI from a two-year to a three-year performance period in 2018 created a gap in their realizable pay opportunity for 2020 (when the 2018 PGI would have been paid, if earned, had it not been eliminated). As a result, the former PGI participants were granted a one-time transition PSU award based on EBIT CAGR over a two-year performance period to fill the gap. This transition award created a one-time spike in the grant date value of 2018 equity-based awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table. However, as illustrated below, with the transition award the realizable pay opportunity remains steady from 2018 to 2021:

2019 Proxy Statement | Leggett & Platt      4  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS 
Leggett & Platt has a long-standing commitment to sound corporate governance principles and practices. The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that establish the roles and responsibilities of the Board and management. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all Company employees, officers and directors, as well as a separate Financial Code of Ethics applicable to the Company's CEO, CFO, and principal accounting officer. These documents can be found at www.leggett-search.com/governance. 
Director Independence 
The Board reviews director independence annually and during the year upon learning of any change in circumstances that may affect a director's independence. The Company has adopted director independence standards (the "Independence Standards") that satisfy the NYSE listing requirements and can be found at www.leggett-search.com/governance. A director who meets all the Independence Standards will be presumed to be independent. 
While the Independence Standards help the Board to determine director independence, they are not the only criteria. The Board also reviews the relevant facts and circumstances of any material relationships between the Company and its directors during the independence assessment. Based on its review, the Board has determined that all of its current non-management directors are independent. The director biographies accompanying Proposal 1—Election of Directors identify our independent and management directors on the ballot. 
All Audit Committee members meet the additional independence standards for audit committee service under NYSE and SEC rules and are financially literate, as defined by NYSE rules. In addition, Robert Brunner, Joseph McClanathan, Judy Odom, and Phoebe Wood meet the SEC's definition of an "audit committee financial expert." No member serves on the audit committee of more than three public companies. 
All Compensation Committee members satisfy the enhanced independence standards required by the NYSE listing standards and SEC rules. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board elected R. Ted Enloe, III in 2016 as the independent Board Chair, believing this arrangement best serves the Board, the Company and our shareholders at this time. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines allow the roles of Board Chair and CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals. This approach allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be separate or combined based upon the Company's needs and the Board's assessment of the Company's leadership from time to time. 
Our non-management directors regularly hold executive sessions without management present. Mr. Enloe, the Board Chair, presides over these executive sessions. At least one executive session per year is attended by only independent, non-management directors. An executive session was held at each quarterly Board meeting in 2018. 
Communication with the Board 
Shareholders and all other interested parties wanting to contact our Board of Directors may e-mail the Board Chair, Mr. Enloe, at boardchair@leggett.com. They can also write to Leggett & Platt Board Chair, P.O. Box 637, Carthage, MO 64836.

[END TABLE]
Board's Oversight of Risk Management 
The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of our guidelines and policies to assess and manage risk. The Company's CEO and other senior managers are responsible for assessing and managing various risk exposures on a day-to-day basis. Our Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the "ERM Committee"), currently composed of 14 executives and chaired by our CFO, adopted guidelines by which the Company identifies, assesses, monitors and reports financial and non-financial risks material to the Company. 
The ERM Committee meets at least quarterly. Identified risks, including emerging risks, are assigned to a team of subject matter experts who meet regularly throughout the year and provide an updated assessment twice each year (or as circumstances require) for their respective risk areas. A risk summary report is assembled from these assessments for review by the ERM Committee with a summary of each risk area provided to senior management and the Audit Committee concerning (i) the likelihood, significance, and impact velocity of risks, (ii) the policies and guidelines regarding risk assessment and management, (iii) management's steps to monitor and control risks, and (iv) an evaluation of the process. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses the report with management and the independent auditor. 
An overall review of risk is inherent to the Board's consideration of the Company's strategies and other matters. In furtherance of this review, our CFO updates other senior managers and the entire Board every quarter on notable activities of the ERM Committee. In addition, a designated Board member receives a copy of all reports lodged through the Company's ethics hotline. 
The Company has formal processes in place for both incident response and cybersecurity continuous improvement that includes a cross functional Cyber Oversight Committee. The 
 General Counsel and the Vice President of Internal Audit (both members of the Cyber Oversight Committee) update the Audit Committee quarterly on cyber activity, with procedures in place for interim reporting as necessary. 
The Compensation Committee's oversight of executive officer compensation, including the assessment of compensation risk for executive officers, is detailed in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section on page 20. The Committee also assesses our compensation structure for employees generally and has concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The following factors contributed to this determination: 
Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating qualified candidates for election to the Board of Directors. The Committee's procedure and the Company's bylaws can be found at www.leggett-search.com/governance. Following its evaluation, the N&CG Committee recommends to the full Board a slate of director candidates for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and proxy card. 
Incumbent Directors. In the case of incumbent directors, the N&CG Committee reviews each director's overall service during his or her current term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance and any transactions between the director and the Company. 
New Director Candidates. In the case of new director candidates, the N&CG Committee first determines whether the nominee will be independent under NYSE rules, then identifies any special needs of the Board. The N&CG Committee will consider individuals recommended by Board members, Company management, shareholders and, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. In 2018, the Company retained Diversified Search to assist with identifying and evaluating potential director candidates, including Mr. Padmanabhan.

[END TABLE]
The N&CG Committee seeks to identify and recruit the best available candidates, who should have the following minimum qualifications: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Character and integrity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A commitment to the long-term growth and profitability of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A willingness and ability to make a sufficient time commitment to the affairs of the Company to effectively perform the  duties of a director, including regular attendance at Board and committee meetings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant business or public experience relevant and beneficial to the Board and the Company.  
[END TABLE]
Board Diversity. The N&CG Committee recognizes the value of cultivating a Board with a diverse mix of opinions, perspectives, skills, experiences, and backgrounds. A diverse board enables more balanced, wide-ranging discussion in the boardroom, which, we believe, enhances the decision-making processes. Having diverse representation and a variety of viewpoints is also important to our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
As such, the N&CG Committee considers director candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds, without discrimination based on race, ethnicity, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, or any other status protected by law. 
All nominations to the Board will be based upon merit and experience relevant to the Board's current and anticipated needs, as well as Leggett's businesses. Subject to this overarching principle, the N&CG Committee will have regard for the need to consider director candidates to maintain and strengthen the Board's diversity. 
Director Recommendations from Shareholders. The N&CG Committee does not intend to alter its evaluation process, including the minimum criteria set forth above, for candidates recommended by a shareholder. Shareholders who wish to recommend candidates for the N&CG Committee's consideration must submit a written recommendation to the Secretary of the Company at 1 Leggett Road, Carthage, MO 64836. Recommendations must be sent by certified or registered mail and received by December 15th for the N&CG Committee's consideration for the following year's annual meeting of shareholders. Recommendations must include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholder's name, number of shares owned, length of period held and proof of ownership.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Candidate's name, address, phone number and age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A resume describing, at a minimum, the candidate's educational background, occupation, employment history and material  outside commitments (memberships on other boards and committees, charitable foundations, etc.).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A supporting statement which describes the shareholder's and candidate's reasons for nomination to the Board of  Directors and documents the candidate's ability to satisfy the director qualifications described above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate's consent to a background investigation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate's written consent to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by the  shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any other information that will assist the N&CG Committee in evaluating the candidate in accordance with this  procedure.  
[END TABLE]
Director Nominations for Inclusion in Leggett's Proxy Materials (Proxy Access). In 2017, the Board approved a proxy access bylaw, which permits a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in Leggett's proxy materials up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board, provided the shareholders and nominees satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws. Notice of proxy access nominees for the 2020 annual meeting must be received no earlier than January 8, 2020 and no later than February 7, 2020.

[END TABLE]
Transactions with Related Persons 
According to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the N&CG Committee reviews and approves or ratifies transactions in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest, the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, and the amount involved exceeds $120,000. If the transaction with a related person concerns compensation, the Compensation Committee conducts the review. 
The Company's executive officers and directors are expected to notify the Company's Corporate Secretary of any current or proposed transaction that may be a related person transaction. The Corporate Secretary will determine if it is a related person transaction and, if so, will include it for consideration at the next meeting of the appropriate Committee. Approval should be obtained in advance of a related person transaction whenever practicable. If it becomes necessary to approve a related person transaction between meetings, the Chair of the appropriate Committee is authorized to act on behalf of the Committee. The Chair will provide a report on the matter to the full Committee at its next meeting. 
The full policy for reviewing transactions with related persons, including categories of pre-approved transactions, is found in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available on our website at www.leggett-search.com/governance. 
Each of the following transactions was approved in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We buy shares of our common stock from our employees from time to time. In 2018 and early 2019, we purchased shares from  three of our executive officers: 10,000 shares from Karl Glassman for a total of $474,100, 64,920 shares from Matthew Flanigan for a total of $2,926,056, and 16,042 shares from Russell Iorio for a total of $733,601. All employees, including  executive officers, pay a $25 administrative fee for each transaction. If the Company agrees to purchase stock before noon, the purchase price is the closing stock price on the prior business day; if the agreement is made after noon, the purchase  price is the closing stock price on the day of purchase.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company employs one relative of its directors and executive officers with total compensation in excess of the $120,000  related person transaction threshold.

Our non-management directors receive an annual retainer, consisting of a mix of cash and equity, as set forth below. Our management directors (Mr. Glassman and Mr. Flanigan) do not receive additional compensation for their Board service.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews director compensation annually and recommends any changes to the full Board for consideration at its May meeting. The Committee considers national survey data and trends, as well as peer company benchmarking data (see discussion of the executive compensation peer group at page 32), but does not target director compensation to any specific percentage of the median. In 2017 and 2018, no changes were made to the director's compensation package. 
Directors may elect to receive the equity retainer in restricted stock or restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Electing RSUs enables directors to defer receipt of the shares for two to ten years while accruing dividend equivalent shares at a 20% discount to market price over the deferral period. Both restricted stock and RSUs vest one year after the grant date. 
Many of our directors have elected to defer a portion of their 2018 cash retainer into Leggett stock units under the Company's Deferred Compensation Program, described on page 30. Interest-bearing cash deferrals and stock options are the other alternatives under the Program. 
Our non-management directors currently comply with the stock ownership guidelines requiring them to hold Leggett stock with a value of five times their annual cash retainer within five years of joining the Board. 
The Company pays for all travel expenses the directors incur to attend Board meetings and for certain guest travel expenses to Board-related events.

2    PROPOSAL TWO: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting  Firm   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee regularly evaluates activities to assure continuing auditor independence, including whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. As with all matters, the members of the Audit Committee and the Board perform assessments in the best interests of the Company and our investors and believe that the continued retention of PwC meets this standard. 
Although shareholder ratification of the Audit Committee's selection of PwC is not required by the Company's bylaws or otherwise, the Board is requesting ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If our shareholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered a direction to the Audit Committee to consider a different firm. Even if this selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. 
PwC representatives are expected to be present at the annual meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of PwC 
as the independent registered public accounting firm.

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the compensation, retention, performance and oversight of the independent external audit firm, directly involved in the selection of the lead engagement partner, and responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with retaining PwC.

Audit-Related Services: consultation on new or proposed transactions, statutory requirements, or accounting principles; reports related to contracts, agreements, arbitration, or government filings; continuing professional education; audits of employee benefit plans and subsidiaries; and due diligence and audits related to acquisitions and joint ventures. 
Tax Services: preparation and review of Company and related entity income, sales, payroll, property, and other tax returns and tax filings and permissible tax audit assistance; preparation or review of expatriate and similar employee tax returns and tax filings; tax consulting and advice related to compliance with applicable tax laws; tax planning strategies and implementation; and tax due diligence related to acquisitions and joint ventures. 
Any other audit, audit-related, or tax services provided by the Company's auditors require specific Audit Committee pre-approval. The Audit Committee must also specifically approve in advance all permissible Non-Audit Services to be performed by the Company's auditors. Management provides quarterly reports to the Audit Committee concerning any fees paid to the auditors for all services. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the approved Non-Audit Services by PwC in 2018 is compatible with maintaining PwC's independence. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee is composed of six non-management directors who are independent as required by SEC and NYSE rules. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board which is posted on the Company's website at www.leggett-search.com/governance. 
Management is responsible for the Company's financial statements and financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls. PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring, overseeing and evaluating these processes, providing recommendations to the Board regarding the independence of and risk assessment procedures used by our independent registered public accounting firm, selecting and retaining our independent registered public accounting firm, and overseeing compliance with various laws and regulations. 
At its meetings, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management and PwC. The Audit Committee also discussed with PwC all items required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 1301—Communications with Audit Committees. 
The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed PwC's independence with them. 
The Audit Committee has relied on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and on the opinion of PwC included in their report on the Company's financial statements. 
Based on review and discussions with management and PwC referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

[END TABLE]
Since Say-on-Pay was implemented in 2011, our shareholders have supported the compensation of our named executive officers with over 90% of the vote (with 95% support in 2018). 
Our Compensation Committee is committed to creating an executive compensation program that enables us to attract and retain a superior management team that has targeted incentives to build long-term value for our shareholders. The Company's compensation package uses a mix of cash and equity-based awards to align executive compensation with our annual and long-term performance. These programs reflect the Committee's philosophy that executive compensation should provide greater rewards for superior performance, as well as accountability for underperformance. At the same time, we believe our programs do not encourage excessive risk-taking by management. The Board believes that our philosophy and practices have resulted in executive compensation decisions that are appropriate and that have benefited the Company over time. 
For these reasons, the Board requests our shareholders approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as described in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and the related footnotes and narrative accompanying the tables. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board; however, the Compensation Committee and the Board has considered and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote when making decisions for future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the Company's named executive officer compensation package. 
Discretionary Vote on Other Matters 
We are not aware of any business to be acted upon at the annual meeting other than the three items described in this proxy statement. Your signed proxy, however, will entitle the persons named as proxy holders to vote in their discretion if another matter is properly presented at the meeting. If one of the director nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate as the Board may nominate.

Executive Summary 
This section provides an overview of our NEOs' compensation structure, Leggett's pay practices, and the Committee's compensation risk management. Additional details regarding the NEOs' pay packages, the Committee's annual review of the executive officers' compensation, and our equity pay practices are covered in the sections that follow. 
Structuring the Mix of Compensation 
The Committee uses its judgment to determine the appropriate percentage of variable and fixed compensation, the use of short-term and long-term performance periods, and the split between cash and equity-based compensation. The ultimate payment and value of the variable elements depends on actual performance and could result in no payout if threshold performance levels are not achieved. The following table shows the key attributes of our executive compensation programs used to drive performance and build long-term shareholder value, following the changes implemented in 2018.

[END TABLE]
Incentive Payouts in 2018 
Our executives' 2018 annual incentive payouts under the Key Officers Incentive Plan (KOIP) tracked the Company's operational results in 2018, in which we generated incentive cash flow of $421 million (versus a target of $400 million, resulting in a 114.8% payout) and 41.2% return on capital employed (versus a target of 45%, resulting in a 73.1% payout). Each of the NEOs also had individual performance goals (IPGs) which accounted for 20% of their target annual incentive payout. The Key Officers Incentive Plan, including the calculations and targets for adjusted cash flow and return on capital employed (ROCE), is described on page 25. 
With respect to our executives' long-term incentive (LTI) awards which vested at the end of 2018, the combination of 7.3% revenue growth and 14.6% EBITDA margin over the two-year performance period for the 2017 Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) awards resulted in a 186.3% payout for Corporate participants. The PGI program, including the calculations and targets for revenue growth and EBITDA margin, is described on page 29. 
Leggett's cumulative TSR from 2016-2018 was -6.5%, which placed us in the 22nd percentile of the peer group, below the vesting threshold, and resulted in no payout for the three-year PSUs granted in 2016. The pre-2018 Performance Stock Units, including the calculation of relative TSR and the vesting schedule, is described on page 29. 
CEO Incentive Compensation Vesting in 2018 
Changes in 2018 
Since 2013, our LTI awards have been entirely performance-based, consisting of (i) two-year PGI awards based on revenue growth and EBITDA margin and (ii) three-year PSU awards based on relative TSR. In 2018, our LTI program underwent the following changes to better align our compensation programs with the Company's long-term strategy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The PGI program was eliminated, and that portion of the participants' LTI was reallocated to the PSU awards, moving it  from a two-year to a three-year performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The metrics for the PSU awards were modified such that 50% will continue to vest based upon relative TSR, and 50% will be  based upon the compound annual growth rate of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT CAGR), key to achieving our long-term TSR goals.

[END TABLE]
Shifting a significant portion of our executives' LTI from a two-year to a three-year performance period in 2018 created a gap in their realizable pay opportunity for 2020 (when the 2018 PGI would have been paid, if earned, had it not been eliminated). As a result, the former PGI participants were granted a one-time transition PSU award based on EBIT CAGR over a two-year performance period to fill the gap. This transition award created a spike in the grant date value of 2018 equity-based awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table (see page 35). However, as illustrated below, with the transition award the realizable pay opportunity remains steady from 2018 to 2021: 
Following the 2018 restructuring of our LTI program, the compensation mix of our CEO and the other NEOs remained heavily weighted to performance-based compensation, with a majority of their pay package being equity-based through the PSUs. 
* Excludes the one-time, transition PSU award with a two-year performance period.

[END TABLE]
Additional Investment in Leggett Stock 
In addition to having pay packages that are heavily weighted to Leggett equity-based awards, for many years our NEOs have voluntarily deferred substantial portions of their cash compensation into Company stock through the Executive Stock Unit (ESU) Program and the Deferred Compensation Program. Through participation in these programs, particularly the ESU Program, in which Company equity is held until the executive leaves the Company, our NEOs are further invested in the long-term success of the Company. 
Managing Compensation Risk 
The Committee regularly reviews whether our executive compensation policies and practices (as well as those that apply to our employees generally) are appropriate and whether they create risks or misalignments that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
We believe that our compensation programs align our executives' incentives for risk taking with the long-term best interests of our shareholders. We mitigate risk by allocating incentive compensation across multiple components. This structure reduces the incentive to take excessive risk because it: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Rewards achievement on a balanced array of performance measures, minimizing undue focus on any single target.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stresses long-term performance, discouraging short-term actions that might endanger long-term value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Combines absolute and relative performance measures.  
[END TABLE]
Additional safeguards against undue compensation risk include stock ownership guidelines, caps on incentive payouts, and clawbacks for performance-based compensation.

Impact of 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our annual meeting of shareholders held on May 15, 2018, 95% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal approved the compensation of our NEOs. The Committee believes that this shareholder vote strongly endorses the Company's compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee took this support into account as one of many factors it considered in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities (as described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis) in exercising its judgment in establishing and overseeing our executive compensation arrangements throughout the year. 
Our Compensation Components and Programs 
Base Salary 
Base salary is the only fixed portion of our NEOs' compensation package. Salary levels are intended to reflect specific responsibilities, performance and experience, while taking into account market compensation levels for comparable positions. Although base salary makes up less than one-fourth of our NEOs' aggregate compensation, it's the foundation for the total package with the variable compensation components set as percentages of base salary: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    2018 Base Salary    Annual Incentive: Target Percentage of Base Salary   PSU Awards:         Target Percentage           of Base Salary 
 Karl G. Glassman, CEO      $ 1,225,000         120%       400% 
 Matthew C. Flanigan, CFO        572,000         80%       250% 
 J. Mitchell Dolloff, COO        512,000         80%       250% 
 Perry E. Davis, EVP        512,000         80%       250% 
 Scott S. Douglas, SVP        380,000         50%       155% 
[END TABLE]
The Committee reviews and determines the NEOs' base salaries (along with the rest of their compensation packages) during the annual review, which is discussed on page 32. In connection with the November 2017 review relating to the executive officers' 2018 compensation, the Committee raised Mr. Glassman's base salary by 4.3%, Mr. Flanigan's by 4.0%, and Mr. Davis' and Mr. Dolloff's by 2.4% each. Mr. Douglas' 2018 base salary was increased by 15.2% as a result of taking on additional responsibilities. The NEOs' annual incentive target percentages remained unchanged for 2018. 
Annual Incentive 
Our NEOs earn their annual incentive, a cash bonus paid under the Key Officers Incentive Plan, based on achieving certain performance targets for the year. 
Our executive officers are divided into two groups under the KOIP for 2018, depending upon their areas of responsibility: (i) corporate participants (Glassman, Flanigan and Douglas), whose performance criteria and payouts are based on the Company's overall results, and (ii) profit center participants (Davis and Dolloff) whose performance targets are set for the operations under their control. The NEOs also have individual performance goals (IPGs) as part of their annual incentive. 
Each NEO has a target incentive amount—the amount received for achieving exactly 100% of all performance goals. The target incentive amount is the officer's base salary multiplied by his target incentive percentage. At the end of the year, the target incentive amount is multiplied by the payout percentages for the various performance metrics (each with its own weighting) to determine the annual incentive payout.

Performance Metrics. The Committee chose ROCE(1) as the primary incentive target with a 60% weighting to improve earnings and maximize returns on key assets by carefully managing working capital and fixed asset investments. The annual incentive is also based upon cash flow(2) with a 20% weighting, which is critical to fund the Company's dividend, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. Profit center participants are also subject to an adjustment ranging from a potential 5% increase for exceptional safety performance to a 20% deduction for their operations' failure to achieve safety, audit and environmental standards.

[END TABLE]
For profit center participants (Davis and Dolloff): the same formula is used, except (i) EBITDA is adjusted for currency effects and (ii) change in working capital excludes balance sheet items not directly related to ongoing activities. 
ROCE and cash flow calculations are adjusted for all items of gain, loss or expense (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in the Company's 2017 10-K; (iii) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (iv) related to a change in accounting principle. Financial results from acquisitions are excluded from calculations in the year of acquisition. Financial results from businesses divested during the year are included, but targets relating to the divested businesses will be prorated to reflect only that portion of the year prior to the divestiture. Financial results from businesses classified as discontinued operations are included in the calculations. Financial results exclude (i) certain currency and hedging-related gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses from asset disposals, and (iii) items that are outside the scope of the Company's core, on-going business activities. 
Individual Performance Goals. In addition to the financial metrics described above, the annual incentive includes IPGs at a 20% weighting that are tailored to each executive's responsibilities and aligned with the Company's strategic goals. The Committee approved the 2018 IPGs covering the following areas of responsibility, with achievement based upon the performance scale detailed in the tables below:

Equity-Based Awards 
We grant performance stock units to our NEOs and other senior managers to tie their pay to the Company's performance and shareholder returns. The payouts from these equity-based awards reflect our philosophy that executive compensation should provide greater rewards for superior performance, as well as accountability for underperformance. 
2018 Three-Year Performance Stock Units. As discussed above, 2018 was a year of transition for our LTI programs. For the previous five years, we granted two-year PGI awards with vesting based upon a combination of revenue growth and EBITDA margin, and three-year PSU awards with vesting based upon relative TSR. Each of the NEOs had their award percentages for these two programs aggregated in 2018 and received a combined PSU award with 50% continuing to vest based upon relative TSR and 50% now vesting based on EBIT CAGR. The Committee believes that the new PSU awards streamline our LTI program while balancing operational performance (EBIT CAGR) and external results (relative TSR).

[END TABLE]
The Committee reviewed the combined award percentages in the context of the benchmarking data and the other considerations described on page 32 and made the following adjustments to the NEOs: Mr. Glassman's combined PSU award percentage was increased from 352% to 400% of base salary, Mr. Flanigan's award percentage was increased from 245% to 250%, Mr. Davis' and Mr. Dolloff's award percentages were both increased from 194% to 250%, and Mr. Douglas' award percentage was increased from 151% to 155%. 
The PSU grants are determined by multiplying the executive's base salary by the PSU award percentage approved by the Committee (see the table on page 24). The vesting schedules for the three-year PSU awards granted in 2018 are as follows:

(1)  Relative TSR is the Company's Total Shareholder Return compared to a peer group consisting of all the companies in  the Industrial, Consumer Discretionary and Materials sectors of the S&P 500 and S&P 400. Although Leggett is a member of the S&P 500, our market capitalization is significantly below that group's median, so the Committee included  the S&P Midcap 400 in the group as well. In addition, nearly all of our business units fall into these industry sectors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  EBIT CAGR is the Company's (for Glassman, Flanigan and Douglas) or applicable Segments' (for Davis and Dolloff)  compound annual growth rate of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) in the third fiscal year of the performance period compared to the Company's (or applicable Segments') EBIT in the fiscal year immediately preceding the performance  period. The calculation of EBIT CAGR will include results from businesses acquired during the performance period and will exclude results for any businesses divested during the performance period. EBIT CAGR will also exclude (i) results from non-operating branches, (ii) certain currency and hedging-related gains and losses, (iii) gains and losses from asset disposals, (iv) items that are outside the scope of the Company's core, on-going business activities, and (v) with respect to Segments, all amounts relating to corporate allocations. EBIT CAGR will be adjusted to eliminate gain, loss or expense, as determined in accordance with  standards established under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in footnotes to the financial statements in the  Company's 10-K relating to the fiscal year immediately preceding the performance period; (iii) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (iv) related to a change in accounting  principle.

2018 Two-Year Transition Performance Stock Units. In connection with the decision to move a significant portion of the long-term incentive opportunity from a two-year to a three-year performance period by eliminating PGI awards in 2018, the Committee also granted each executive officer a one-time transition PSU award in 2018 based upon EBIT CAGR only (see the vesting schedule above) over a two-year performance period. This transition PSU award was set at 50% of the executive officers' 2018 PSU award percentages described above. This transition award creates a one-time spike in the grant date value of 2018 equity-based awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table, but the realizable pay opportunity remains steady from 2018 to 2021 as the transition from two-year to three-year vesting takes place (see the chart at page 22). 
When the 2018 PSUs vest, we anticipate that they will be paid out 50% in Company stock and 50% in cash, although the Company reserves the right to pay up to 100% in cash.

Pre-2018 Awards: Performance Stock Units and Profitable Growth Incentive. Prior to 2018, the three-year PSUs were based solely on Leggett's relative TSR with the following vesting schedule: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Target    50th      75% 
 Maximum    >75th    175% 
[END TABLE]
The performance period for the 2016 PSU awards ended on December 31, 2018, with Leggett's TSR for that three-year period below the 25th percentile, resulting in no payout. Our TSR ranks in the 21st percentile for the 2017 PSU awards with one year remaining in the performance period. These PSUs will be paid out 65% in Company stock and 35% in cash, although the Company reserves the right to pay up to 100% in cash. 
Through 2017, the NEOs' compensation package included the Profitable Growth Incentive, a performance-based equity program with a two-year performance period and payouts based on a matrix of revenue growth and EBITDA margin. The threshold achievement for revenue growth was the projected GDP growth of our primary geographic markets, and the EBITDA margin scale was based upon the Company's prior three-year average. The PGI payout scale was intended to reward growth at or above GDP while maintaining or improving historical margins. 
For the PGI awards granted in 2017, the payout schedule for our corporate participants (Glassman, Flanigan and Douglas) was:

EBITDA results were  adjusted to eliminate gain, loss or expense (i) from non-cash impairments; (ii) related to loss contingencies identified in the Company's 2016 10-K;  (iii) that are unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence; (iv) related to the disposal of a segment of a business; or (v) related to a change in accounting principle.

Each of the profit center participants has his own payout matrix based upon the operations for which he is responsible: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Dolloff's payout matrix was structured in the same manner as shown above, but it was based on an EBITDA  margin range of 22.6% to 29.6% and a revenue growth range of 3.2% to 10.2% for the Specialized Products Segment and an EBITDA margin range of 15.3% to 22.3% and a revenue growth range of 2.9% to 9.9% for the Furniture Products Segment. His 2017 PGI  award was apportioned between Specialized Products (56.1%) and Furniture Products (43.9%) based on their relative 2016 EBITDA.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Davis' payout matrix was based on an EBITDA margin range of 17.3% to 24.3% and a revenue growth range of 2.4%  to 9.4% for the Residential Products Segment and an EBITDA margin range of 14.3% to 21.3% and a revenue growth range of 2.5% to 9.5% for the Industrial Products Segment. His 2017 PGI award was apportioned between Residential Products (79.8%) and  Industrial Products (20.2%) based on their relative 2016 EBITDA.  
[END TABLE]
The PGI awards granted in 2017 vested on December 31, 2018. Corporate participants received a 186.3% payout as a result of 7.3% revenue growth and 14.6% EBITDA margin achievement over those two years. Mr. Dolloff received a PGI payout of 140.3% for the profit centers for which he is responsible, and Mr. Davis received a 145.3% payout for his profit centers. These awards were paid out 50% in Company stock and 50% in cash. 
Other Compensation Programs 
The NEOs have voluntarily deferred substantial portions of their cash compensation into Leggett equity through the Executive Stock Unit Program and the Deferred Compensation Program for many years, building an additional long-term stake in the Company. The Company also provides 401(k) and non-qualified excess plans in which some of our executives choose to participate. 
Executive Stock Unit Program. All our NEOs have significant holdings in the ESU Program, our primary executive retirement plan. These accounts are held until the executive terminates his employment. 
The ESU Program is a non-qualified retirement program that allows executives to make pre-tax deferrals of up to 10% of their compensation into diversified investments. We match 50% of the executive's contribution in Company stock units, purchased at a 15% discount, which may increase up to a 100% match if the Company meets annual ROCE targets linked to the Incentive Plan. The Company makes an additional 17.6% contribution to the diversified investments acquired with executive contributions. Matching contributions vest once employees have participated in the ESU Program for five years. Leggett stock units held in the ESU Program accrue dividends, which are used to acquire additional stock units at a 15% discount. At distribution, the balance of the diversified investments is paid in cash. Although the Company intends to settle the stock units in shares of the Company's common stock, it reserves the right to distribute the balance in cash. 
Deferred Compensation Program. The Deferred Compensation Program allows key managers to defer up to 100% of salary, incentive awards and other cash compensation in exchange for any combination of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock units with dividend equivalents, acquired at a 20% discount to the fair market value of our common stock on the dates  the compensation or dividends otherwise would have been paid.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At-market stock options with the underlying shares of common stock having an  initial market value five times the amount of compensation forgone, with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash deferrals accruing interest at a rate intended to be slightly higher than otherwise available for comparable  investments.  
[END TABLE]
Participants who elect a cash or stock unit deferral can receive distributions in a lump sum or in annual installments. Distribution payouts must begin no more than 10 years from the effective date of the deferral and all amounts subject to the deferral must be distributed within 10 years of the first distribution payout. Although the Company intends to settle the stock units in shares of the Company's common stock, it reserves the right to distribute the balance in cash. Participants who elect at-market stock options, which have a 10-year term, may exercise them approximately 15 months after the start of the year in which the deferral was made.

Retirement K and Excess Plan. The Company's defined benefit Retirement Plan was frozen in 2006 (see description on page 41). Employees who had previously participated in the Retirement Plan were offered a replacement benefit: a tax-qualified defined contribution Section 401(k) Plan (Retirement K). The Retirement K includes an age-weighted Company matching contribution designed to replicate the benefits lost by the Retirement Plan freeze. 
Many of our officers cannot fully participate in the Retirement K due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or due to their participation in the Deferred Compensation Program. Consequently, we maintain a non-qualified Retirement K Excess Plan which permits affected executives to receive the full matching benefit they would otherwise have been entitled to under the Retirement K. Amounts earned in the Retirement K Excess Plan are paid out in cash no later than March 15 of the following year and are eligible for the Deferred Compensation Program. 
Perquisites and Personal Benefits 
The Committee believes perquisites should not be a significant part of our executive compensation program. In 2018, perquisites were less than 1% of each NEO's total compensation and consisted of use of a Company car, executive physicals, spousal travel expenses to Board-related events, and limited personal use of corporate aircraft by our CEO. 
Given the location of the Company's headquarters away from any major metropolitan area, the Committee wished to facilitate Mr. Glassman's schedule and allow him to more efficiently attend to Company business by offering him limited personal use of corporate aircraft, when the aircraft is not scheduled for business purposes. The use of corporate aircraft for personal travel by Mr. Glassman and his guests is subject to an annual limit of $100,000 in aggregate incremental cost to the Company, including the cost of "deadhead" flights necessitated by such personal use. The Company does not provide tax reimbursements to Mr. Glassman for any taxes arising from imputed income relating to his use of the corporate aircraft for personal travel by him or his guests. 
We believe these benefits are appropriate when viewed in the overall context of our executive compensation program. 
How Compensation Decisions Are Made 
The Committee uses its informed judgment to determine the appropriate type and mix of compensation elements; to select performance measures, target levels and payout schedules for incentive compensation; and to determine the level of salary and incentive awards for each executive officer. The Committee may delegate its duties and responsibilities to one or more Committee members or Company officers, as it deems appropriate, but may not delegate authority to non-members for any action involving executive officers. The full Board must review and approve certain actions, including any employment and severance benefit agreements and amendments to stock plans. 
The Committee has the authority to engage its own external compensation consultant as needed and has engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC as its independent consultant since 2012. The Company conducts an annual conflict of interest assessment, which the Committee reviews to verify, in the Committee's judgment, Meridian's independence and that no conflicts of interest exist. Meridian does not provide any other services to the Company and works with the Company's management only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. 
In 2018, the Committee engaged Meridian to perform a competitive review of the Company's executive pay programs in comparison to market levels. Meridian also advised on selecting a peer group of companies for executive compensation benchmarking, provided comparative data for the annual executive compensation review described below, and assisted with other compensation matters as requested. Representatives from Meridian also attend Committee meetings on request. 
The Company's Legal and Human Resources Departments also provide compensation data, research and analysis that the Committee may request, and personnel from those departments, along with Mr. Glassman and Mr. Flanigan, attend Committee meetings. However, the Committee regularly meets in executive session without management present to discuss CEO performance and compensation, as well as any other matters deemed appropriate by the Committee. 
The CEO recommends to the Committee compensation levels for the other executive officers, including salary increases, annual incentive targets and equity award values, based on his assessment of each executive's performance and level of responsibility. The Committee evaluates those recommendations and accepts or makes adjustments as it deems appropriate.

[END TABLE]
The Annual Review and Use of Compensation Data 
The Committee conducts an annual review of executive compensation at its November meeting to set the executive officers' compensation for the following year. 
During the annual review, the Committee evaluates the three primary elements of the annual compensation package for executive officers: base salary, annual incentive, and PSUs. As discussed above, increases to base salary affect the other elements of the compensation package because the variable compensation elements (annual incentive and PSUs) are each set as a percentage of base salary. The Committee also reviews the secondary compensation elements, such as voluntary equity plans and retirement plans, as well as potential payments upon termination or change in control. Decisions about secondary and post-termination compensation elements are made at various times throughout the year as the plans or agreements giving rise to the compensation are reviewed. 
In connection with the annual review, the Committee evaluates the following data presented by the Company and Meridian to consider each executive's compensation package in the context of past decisions, internal pay relationships and the external market: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation data available from proxy filings of the executive compensation peer group, and two general industry surveys  published by national consulting firms (described more fully below).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Current annual compensation for each executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The potential value of each executive officer's compensation package under three Company performance scenarios  (threshold, target and outstanding performance).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Comparison of CEO target and realizable pay for the prior five years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The cash-to-equity ratio and fixed-to-variable pay ratio of each executive officer's compensation package.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compliance with our stock ownership requirements and a summary of outstanding equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
Among the factors the Committee considers when making compensation decisions is the compensation of our NEOs relative to the compensation paid to similarly-situated executives in our markets. We believe, however, that a benchmark should be just that—a point of reference for measurement, not the determinative factor for our executives' compensation. Because the comparative compensation information is just one of several analytic tools used in setting executive compensation, the Committee has discretion in determining the nature and extent of its use. 
Benchmarking Against Peer Companies. In the annual review, the Committee used a peer group to provide additional insight into company-specific pay levels and practices. The Committee evaluates market data provided by compensation surveys and views the use of a peer group as an additional reference point when reviewing the competitiveness of NEO pay levels. 
In developing the peer group, the Committee directed Meridian to focus on companies in comparable industries with a similar size and scope of business operations as Leggett. The Committee periodically reviews the composition of the peer group to ensure these companies remain relevant for comparative purposes. 
For the annual review to set 2018 compensation, the Committee approved the following peer group of 17 U.S.-based, publicly-traded manufacturing companies, with Leggett near the group's median revenue and market capitalization:

[END TABLE]
Compensation Survey Data. The Committee used broad-based compensation surveys published by Towers Watson (U.S. Compensation Data Bank—General Industry) and Aon Hewitt (TCM Total Compensation by Industry—Executive, United States) to develop a balanced picture of the compensation market. 
We sought the largest sample size possible from each survey, as we believe the validity of data increases with sample size. The Committee reviewed data from large companies across all industries (with median revenue of $4.0 billion) from the Towers Watson survey and large manufacturing companies (with median revenue of $3.6 billion) from the Aon Hewitt survey. The Committee used comparator groups that most closely match the NEOs' job descriptions; however, the Committee is not made aware of the specific companies in the applicable survey groups. 
The Committee used the peer group and compensation surveys to get a general sense of the competitive market. These sources generally showed our executive officers' compensation was in line with median total compensation with an above-average percentage of at-risk, performance-based pay. Individual pay levels may vary relative to the market median for a number of reasons, including tenure, responsibilities, performance and the like. 
Additional Considerations. Although the Committee views benchmarking data as a useful guide, it gives significant weight to (i) the mix of fixed to variable pay, (ii) the ratio of cash to equity-based compensation, (iii) internal pay equity, and (iv) individual responsibilities, experience and merit when establishing base salaries, annual incentive percentages, and PSU award percentages. While the Committee monitors these pay relationships, it does not target any specific pay ratios. 
The Committee also considers the Company's merit increase budget for all salaried U.S. employees in determining salary increases for executive officers. 
Equity Grant Practices 
The Committee discussed the 2018 LTI awards at length at its November 2017 meeting in connection with the annual review, then approved the 2018 PSU awards at its February 2018 meeting. The Committee does not approve grants of equity-based awards when it is aware of material inside information. 
Performance of Past Equity-Based Awards. The Committee monitors the value of past equity-based awards to gain an overall assessment of how current compensation decisions fit with past practices and to determine the executives' accumulated variable compensation. However, the Committee does not increase current-year equity-based awards, or any other aspect of the NEOs' compensation, to adjust for below-expected performance of past equity-based awards. 
Clawback Provisions. All equity-based awards are subject to a clawback provision included in our Flexible Stock Plan, which allows the Committee to recover any benefits received on the vesting, exercise or payment of any award if the employee violates any confidentiality, non-solicitation or non-compete obligations, or engages in activity adverse to the interests of the Company, including fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatement. In addition, the award documents for our PSU awards include clawback provisions triggered if the Company is required to restate previously reported financial results. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines. The Committee believes executive officers should maintain a meaningful ownership stake in the Company to align their interests with those of our shareholders. We expect executive officers to attain the following levels of stock ownership within five years of appointment and to maintain those levels throughout their employment. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position       Ownership Requirement   
 Position       Ownership Requirement   
 CEO    5X base salary 
 CFO, COO and EVP    3X base salary 
 All Other Executive Officers    2X base salary 
[END TABLE]
Shares of the Company's stock owned outright, stock units and net shares acquirable upon the exercise of deferred compensation stock options count toward satisfying the ownership totals. A decline in the stock price can cause an executive officer who previously met the threshold to fall below it temporarily. An executive officer who has not met the ownership requirement or falls below it due to a stock price decline, may not sell Leggett shares and must hold any net shares acquired upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of stock units until he meets the ownership threshold. As of March 5, 2019, all our NEOs were in compliance with their stock ownership requirements with holdings well in excess of these threshold levels.

Change in Control Agreements 
Our NEOs do not have employment agreements and are all considered at-will employees. 
In 2017, the Company entered into severance benefit agreements with Mr. Glassman, Mr. Flanigan, Mr. Davis and Mr. Dolloff. Mr. Douglas also has a severance benefit agreement which was last amended in 2008. These agreements are designed to protect both the executive officers' and the Company's interests in the event of a change in control of the Company. The material terms and conditions of these agreements and the Company's potential financial obligations arising from these agreements are described on page 43. 
The benefits provided under the severance benefit agreements do not impact the Committee's decisions regarding other elements of the executive officers' compensation. Because these agreements provide contingent compensation, not regular compensation, they are evaluated separately in view of their intended purpose. 
Tax Considerations 
For tax years prior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed an income tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1 million paid to certain executive officers; however, qualifying performance-based compensation was not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax reform legislation, which, among other things, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m). As a result, the Company currently expects that, with respect to 2018 and beyond, any compensation amounts over $1 million paid to any NEO will no longer be tax deductible unless grandfathered under the exception for pre-existing contractual arrangements.

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis with management and, based on that review and discussion, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that this Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

(3)   The Company granted two types of PSU awards in 2018 in connection with the discontinuation of the PGI program. The primary  PSU awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period with 50% based on our TSR as measured relative to a peer group and 50% based upon EBIT CAGR. A second, one-time transition PSU award was also  granted in 2018 with a two-year performance period with payouts based solely on EBIT CAGR. This transition PSU award is intended to bridge the payout gap which would have been created in early 2020 by  terminating the two-year PGI program and shifting all performance-based equity awards to a three-year term. The PSU awards are described on page 27.

(4)  DSU amounts (from the Deferred Compensation Program described on page 30) reported in this column represent stock units  acquired in lieu of cash compensation. Stock units are purchased on a bi-weekly basis or as compensation otherwise is earned, so there is no grant date for these awards. DSUs are acquired at a 20% discount to  the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date. We recognize a compensation expense for this discount, which is reported in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 35.

For the 2018-2020 PSU awards, these amounts reflect the maximum  payout (200% of the base award) because the combination of Leggett's TSR ranking as of December 31, 2018 and our projected EBIT CAGR for the performance period place the anticipated payouts above the target level. For the 2018-2019  transition PSU awards, these amounts reflect the maximum payout (200% of the base award) because our projected EBIT CAGR for the performance period place the anticipated payouts above the target level.

Pension Benefits in 2018 
We had a voluntary, tax-qualified, defined benefit pension plan (the "Retirement Plan"), which was frozen December 31, 2006. Benefits accrued under the Retirement Plan were fixed as of that date, and the Retirement Plan was closed to new participants. In 2007, employees who had previously participated in the Retirement Plan were offered a replacement benefit package consisting of the Retirement K and the Retirement K Excess Program discussed at page 31. Although participants no longer accrue additional benefits under the Retirement Plan, the present value of the benefits may increase or decrease each year based on the assumptions used to calculate the benefit for financial reporting purposes. 
The Retirement Plan required a contribution from participating employees of 2% of base salary. Normal monthly retirement benefits are the sum of 1% of the employee's average monthly salary for each year of participation in the Retirement Plan. Benefits are calculated based on actual years of participation in the Retirement Plan, and benefits become payable when a participant reaches age 65 (normal retirement age). Mr. Glassman, Mr. Flanigan, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Douglas are eligible for early retirement benefits under the Retirement Plan (minimum age 55 and at least 15 years of service), under which they would receive a monthly benefit reduced by 1/180th for the first 60 months and a monthly benefit reduced by 1/360th for any additional months before reaching normal retirement age. Mr. Dolloff is not a Retirement Plan participant. 
The following table lists the present value of accumulated benefits payable to the NEOs under the Retirement Plan:

 Scott S. Douglas    31            218,698          —      
[END TABLE]
To calculate the present value of the accumulated Retirement Plan benefit, we took the annual accrued benefit through December 31, 2018 that would be payable at normal retirement age, assuming no future contributions. We converted that amount to a lump sum using an annuity factor from the RP2014 mortality table and discounted that amount back to December 31, 2018 using a 4.0% discount rate for US plans. The discount rate, measurement date and mortality assumptions are the same as those used for financial reporting purposes found in Note N to Consolidated Financial Statements to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, except those are reported on a weighted average basis for all plans.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
This section describes the payments and benefits that may be received by our NEOs upon termination of employment, in excess of the amounts generally paid to our salaried employees upon termination of employment. None of the NEOs have employment agreements and are all considered at-will employees. 
Severance Benefit Agreements. In 2017, the Company entered into new severance benefit agreements with Mr. Glassman, Mr. Flanigan, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Dolloff, which provide for specific payments and benefits upon certain termination events or a change in control of the Company. Upon a change in control of the Company, the severance agreements provide for severance payments and benefits over 24 months (the "Protected Period").

[END TABLE]
In general, a change in control is deemed to occur when: (i) a shareholder acquires shares giving it ownership of 40% or more of our common stock, (ii) the current directors or their "successors" no longer constitute a majority of the Board of Directors, (iii) after a merger or consolidation with another corporation, less than 65% of the voting securities of the surviving corporation are owned by our former shareholders, (iv) the Company is liquidated or sells substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party, or (v) the Company enters into an agreement or publicly announces an intent to take actions which would result in a change in control. 
The payments and benefits payable under the severance agreements are subject to a "double trigger"; that is, they become payable only after both (i) a change in control of the Company and (ii) the executive officer's employment is terminated by the Company (except for cause or upon disability) or the executive officer terminates his employment for "good reason." In general, the executive officer would have good reason to terminate his employment if he were required to relocate or experienced a reduction in job responsibilities, compensation or benefits, or if the successor company did not assume the obligations under the agreement. The Company may cure the "good reason" for termination within 30 days of receiving notice of such from the executive. 
If Company terminates the executive for cause, the severance benefits do not become payable. Events triggering a termination for cause include (i) conviction of a felony or any crime involving Company property, (ii) willful breach of the Code of Conduct or Financial Code of Ethics that causes significant injury to the Company, (iii) willful act or omission of fraud, misappropriation or dishonesty that causes significant injury to the Company or results in material enrichment of the executive at the Company's expense, (iv) willful violation of specific written directions of the Board following notice of such violation, or (v) continuing, repeated, willful failure to substantially perform duties after written notice from the Board. 
Once the double trigger conditions are satisfied, the executive becomes entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary through the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pro-rata annual incentive award based upon the actual results under the Key  Officers Incentive Plan for the year of termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance payments equal to 200% of base salary and target annual incentive paid in  bi-weekly installments over 24 months following the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continuation of health insurance, life insurance and fringe benefits for 24 months following the date of termination, as  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, or an equivalent bi-weekly cash payment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Lump sum additional retirement benefit based upon the actuarial equivalent of an additional 24 months of continuous service  following the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
The executive is not required to mitigate the amount of any termination payment or benefit provided under his severance benefit agreement, but any health insurance or fringe benefits he may receive from a new job will reduce any benefits provided under the agreement. 
Mr. Douglas also has a severance benefit agreement, last amended in 2008, the terms of which are substantially similar to those described above, with the following exceptions: (i) the Protected Period is 12 months, (ii) the pro-rata annual incentive for the year of termination is based upon the maximum payout under the Key Officers Incentive Plan, (iii) severance payments are equal to 100% of base salary and target annual incentive over a 12 month period, (iv) health insurance and fringe benefits continued for 12 months following the date of termination, and (v) the lump sum additional retirement benefit is based upon 12 months of additional service. This agreement also provides that, prior to a change in control, the Company must provide three months' prior notice to terminate his employment. 
Accelerated Vesting of PSUs and Options. The terms and conditions of the PSU awards provide for "double trigger" vesting (a change in control of the Company that leads to a termination of employment), such that all outstanding PSUs will vest at the maximum payout percentage (175% for PSUs granted prior to 2018 and 200% for PSUs granted in 2018). Stock option awards from previous years provide for immediate, "single trigger" vesting in the event of a change in control of the Company. The acceleration of equity-based award vesting upon a change in control is designed to ensure that ongoing employees receive the benefit of the transaction by having the opportunity to realize value from their equity-based awards at the time of the transaction.

[END TABLE]
The tables below provide the estimated potential payments and benefits that the NEOs would receive in the event of any termination of employment. We have used the following assumptions and methodology to calculate these amounts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each termination of employment is deemed to have occurred on December 31, 2018. Potential payments reflect the  benefits and arrangements in effect on that date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The tables reflect only the additional payments and benefits the NEOs would be entitled to receive as a result of the  termination of employment. Fully vested benefits described elsewhere in this proxy statement (such as deferred compensation accounts and pension benefits) and payments generally available to U.S. employees upon termination of employment (such as  accrued vacation) are not included in the tables.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To project the value of stock plan benefits, we used the December 31, 2018 closing market price of our common stock  of $35.84 per share and a dividend yield of 4.24%.  
[END TABLE]
The potential payments and benefits presented in the following tables are only estimates provided solely for disclosure purposes and may vary from the amounts that are ultimately paid in connection with an actual termination of employment.

(1)   This amount represents the total bi-weekly cash severance payments made during  the Protected Period pursuant to the severance agreements. The severance agreements for Mr. Glassman, Mr. Flanigan, Mr. Davis, and Mr. Dolloff also provide for a pro-rata annual incentive  payment for the year in which the termination occurs; however, this amount vests under the Key Officers Incentive Plan on December 31 of each year, so no incremental compensation would have been payable as of December 31, 2018.  Mr. Douglas' severance agreement provides for a pro-rata annual incentive payment at the maximum payout level, so his severance payment also includes the difference between his actual 2018 KOIP  payout and the maximum payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   Upon a termination of employment following a change in control, the PSU awards provide for payout at the maximum (175%  for awards granted prior to 2018 and 200% for awards granted in 2018). These amounts represent the incremental portion of the award attributable to the additional vesting beyond December 31, 2018: 33% of the 2017-2019 PSU awards, 50% of the  2018-2019 transition PSU awards, and 67% of the 2018-2020 PSU awards.

(1)   The PSU awards provide for continued vesting for 18 months after the onset of the disability leading to the  executive's termination. These amounts represent the value of the awards' additional vesting following termination and are based on the projected payouts as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of a termination of employment due to a NEO's death, the standard salaried employee's life insurance benefit is payable at two times base salary (up to a maximum $800,000), which doubles in the event of death due to an accident. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
The following pay ratio disclosure is the Company's reasonable, good faith estimate based upon the methodology described below, pursuant to the SEC's guidance under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
The annual compensation of Leggett's Chief Executive Officer for 2018 (as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 35, plus the value of employer-provided health benefits) was $10,577,722, and the annual compensation for our median employee (including employer-provided health benefits) was $32,182 resulting in a ratio of 329 to 1. Excluding the one-time PSU award (described at page 28) granted in connection with the elimination of the two-year PGI program and the transition to a three-year performance period, the adjusted annual compensation of Leggett's CEO in 2018 would have been $8,154,011, resulting in a ratio of 253 to 1. 
As a multi-national manufacturing company, a majority of Leggett's workforce is employed outside the United States. In addition, approximately three-fourths of Leggett's employees are hourly-paid production workers. Leggett operates 145 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries, and we offer competitive compensation and benefits in line with local labor markets and in accordance with applicable laws. 
As of October 1, 2018, we had a total of 22,434 U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In establishing the population from which to identify our median employee, we excluded all employees located in Brazil (329), Hungary (146), India (320) and South Africa (276) under the 5% de minimis exception of Item 402(u), based upon the 22,434 total. We gathered compensation data for a statistically relevant, randomized sample of 400 employees from across our entire, world-wide employee base (less the de minimis exclusion described above and excluding the CEO). We used cash compensation paid during fiscal year 2018 as the consistently applied compensation measure to identify the median employee, which consisted of wages, overtime, salary and bonuses. Compensation of non-U.S. employees was converted from local currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018. For those employees hired and/or separated from service in 2018, their cash compensation paid in 2018 was annualized. 
After reviewing a broad range of 2018 CEO pay ratio disclosures, we modified our methodology in 2019 by adjusting the countries excluded under the de minimis exception and by annualizing the pay of partial-year employees when identifying the Company's median employee.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's executive officers and directors to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of common stock with the SEC. We must identify in this proxy statement those persons for whom reports were not filed on a timely basis. Based solely on a review of the forms that have been filed and written representations from the reporting persons, we believe that all Section 16 filing requirements applicable to such persons were complied with during 2018, except four transactions for Karl G. Glassman where, due to a benefit plan administrative error, the number of Leggett stock units awarded as reinvested dividends were under-reported by the following amounts on the Form 4s filed April 16, 2018 (29.9356 units), July 16, 2018 (30.9829 units), October 16, 2018 (36.7628 units), and January 16, 2019 (37.6572 units). Once the error was discovered, the corrected transactions were promptly reported.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL MEETING 
Why did I receive these materials? 
The Board of Directors is providing these materials to you in connection with its solicitation of proxies for the Company's annual meeting of shareholders on May 7, 2019. As a Leggett shareholder, you are entitled and encouraged to vote on the proposals presented in these proxy materials. We invite you to attend the annual meeting, but you do not have to attend to be able to vote. 
Where can I obtain financial information about Leggett? 
Our Annual Report to Shareholders, including our Form 10-K with financial statements for 2018, is enclosed in the same mailing with this proxy statement. The Company's Proxy Statement and Annual Report to Shareholders (including Form 10-K) are also available at www.leggett.com/proxy/2019. Information on our website does not constitute part of this proxy statement. 
What shares can I vote? 
The only class of outstanding voting securities is the Company's common stock. Each share of common stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on March 5, 2019 (the "Record Date") is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the annual meeting. On the Record Date, we had 131,221,639 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
You may vote all shares of Leggett common stock you owned on the Record Date. This includes shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record and shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, trustee or other nominee, sometimes referred to as shares held in "street name." 
Shareholder of Record: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Equiniti, you are the shareholder of record, and these proxy materials were sent to you directly. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your proxy vote directly or to vote in person at the annual meeting. We have enclosed a proxy card for you to use. 
Beneficial Owner: If you hold shares in a brokerage account or through some other nominee, you are the beneficial owner of the shares, and these proxy materials were delivered by the broker, trustee or nominee, together with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares by proxy. Although you are invited to attend the annual meeting, you may not vote these shares in person unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, trustee or nominee. 
How do I submit my vote? 
You may vote your shares (i) online at www.proxypush.com/leg, (ii) by signing and returning the proxy or voting instruction card, or (iii) in person at the meeting. If you vote online, you do not need to return your proxy or voting instruction card, but you will need to have it in hand when you access the voting website. Specific voting instructions are found on the proxy card or voting instruction card included with this proxy statement. 
The Board recommends you vote FOR each of the director nominees in Proposal 1, FOR the ratification of PwC in Proposal 2, and FOR the approval of named executive officer compensation in Proposal 3. All shares for which proxies have been properly submitted and not revoked will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with your instructions. If you returned a signed proxy card without marking one or more proposals, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations. 
Can I change my vote? 
Shareholder of Record: If you are a shareholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy any time before the annual meeting by (i) submitting a valid, later-dated proxy, (ii) submitting a valid, subsequent vote online, (iii) notifying the Company's Secretary that you have revoked your proxy, or (iv) completing a written ballot at the annual meeting. 
Beneficial Owner: If you hold shares as the beneficial owner, you may change your vote by (i) submitting new voting instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee or (ii) voting in person at the annual meeting if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, trustee or nominee.

[END TABLE]
How many votes are needed to conduct business at the annual meeting? 
A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote must be present at the annual meeting, or represented by proxy, in order to meet the quorum requirement to transact business. Both abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are counted in determining a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the annual meeting will be adjourned for no more than 90 days to reach a quorum. 
What vote is required to elect a director? 
A director nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present (either in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote. 
As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each nominee has submitted a contingent resignation to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee in order to be nominated for election as a director. If a nominee fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the director election, the N&CG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director's resignation and whether any other action should be taken. If a director's resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company's next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. If the Board accepts the resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy. 
What vote is required to approve the other proposals? 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required for ratification of PwC as Leggett's independent registered public accounting firm. Since the vote on named executive officer compensation is advisory, the Board will give due consideration to the outcome; however, the proposal is not approved as such. 
What is the effect of an abstention vote on the election of directors and other proposals? 
A share voted abstain with respect to any proposal is considered present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal. For the proposals requiring a majority vote in order to pass, an abstention will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. 
What is the effect of a broker non-vote? 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker or other nominee and do not vote your shares or provide voting instructions, your broker may vote for you on routine proposals but not on non-routine proposals. Therefore, if you do not vote on the non-routine proposals or provide voting instructions, your broker will not be allowed to vote your shares—this will result in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes are not counted as shares present and entitled to vote, so they will not affect the outcome of the vote. All proposals on the agenda are non-routine, other than the ratification of PwC as the Company's auditor. 
Who pays the cost of soliciting votes at the annual meeting? 
Leggett is making this solicitation and will pay the full cost of preparing, printing, assembling and mailing these proxy materials. Upon request, we will also reimburse brokers and other nominees for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to shareholders. 
We have hired Alliance Advisors, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies by mail, telephone, in person or otherwise. Alliance's solicitation fees are expected to be $10,000, plus expenses. If necessary to ensure sufficient representation at the meeting, Company employees, at no additional compensation, may request the return of proxies from shareholders. 
Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and plan to issue a press release promptly after the meeting. Within four business days after the annual meeting, we will file a Form 8-K reporting the vote count.

[END TABLE]
What should I do if I receive more than one set of proxy materials? 
You may receive multiple sets of proxy materials if you hold shares in more than one brokerage account or if you are a shareholder of record and have shares registered in more than one name. Please vote the shares on each proxy card or voting instruction card you receive. 
We have adopted householding which allows us, unless a shareholder withholds consent, to send one set of proxy materials to multiple shareholders sharing the same address. Each shareholder at a given address will receive a separate proxy card. If you currently receive multiple sets of proxy materials and wish to have your accounts householded, or if you want to opt out of householding, call EQ Shareowner Services at 800-468-9716 or send written instructions to EQ Shareowner Services, Attn: Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, P.O. Box 64854, St. Paul, MN 55164-0854. You will need to provide your Equiniti account number, which can be found on your proxy card. 
Many brokerage firms practice householding as well. If you have a householding request for your brokerage account, please contact your broker. 
How may I obtain another set of proxy materials? 
If you received only one set of proxy materials for multiple shareholders of record and would like us to send you another set this year, please call 800-888-4569 or write to Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Attn: Investor Relations, 1 Leggett Road, Carthage, MO 64836, and we will deliver these documents to you promptly upon your request. You can also access a complete set of proxy materials (the Notice of Meeting, Proxy Statement, and Annual Report to Shareholders including Form 10-K) online at www.leggett.com/proxy/2019. To ensure that you receive multiple copies in the future, please contact your broker or Equiniti at the number or address in the preceding answer to withhold your consent for householding. 
What is the deadline to propose actions for next year's annual meeting? 
Shareholders may propose actions for consideration at future annual meetings either by presenting them for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement or by soliciting votes independent of our proxy statement. To be properly brought before the meeting, all shareholder actions must comply with our bylaws, as well as SEC requirements under Regulation 14A. Leggett's bylaws are posted on our website at www.leggett-search.com/governance. Notices specified for the types of shareholder actions set forth below must be addressed to Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 1 Leggett Road, Carthage, MO 64836. 
Shareholder Proposal Included in Proxy Statement: If you intend to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting, SEC rules require that the Corporate Secretary receive the proposal at the address given above by November 27, 2019 for possible inclusion in the proxy statement. We will decide whether to include a proposal in the proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules governing the solicitation of proxies. 
Shareholder Proposal Not Included in Proxy Statement: If you intend to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting by soliciting votes independent of the Company's proxy statement, Section 1.2 of our bylaws requires that the Company receive timely notice of the proposal—no earlier than January 8, 2020 and no later than February 7, 2020. This notice must include a description of the proposed business, your name and address, the number of shares you hold, any of your material interests in the proposal, and other matters specified in the bylaws. The nature of the business also must be appropriate for shareholder action under applicable law. The bylaw requirements also apply in determining whether notice is timely under SEC rules relating to the exercise of discretionary voting authority. 
Director Nominees: If you wish to recommend a director candidate for the N&CG Committee's consideration, submit a proxy access director nominee, or nominate a director candidate outside of the Company's nomination process, see the requirements described under Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity on page 7.
