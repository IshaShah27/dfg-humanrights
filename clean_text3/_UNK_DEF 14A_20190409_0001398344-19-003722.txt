Additional information regarding each Nominee's and Trustee's current age, principal occupations and other directorships, if any, that have been held by the Trustees for the past five years is provided in the table below. 
Leadership Structure of the Board 
The Board, which has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Fund's investment programs and business affairs, believes that it has structured itself in a manner that allows it to effectively perform its oversight obligations. Mr. Deems, the Chairman of the Board ("Chairman"), is an Independent Trustee. The Trustees also complete an annual self-assessment during which the Trustees review their overall structure and consider where and how its structure remains appropriate in light of the Fund's current circumstances. The Chairman's role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and in between Board meetings to generally act as the liaison between the Board and the Fund's officers, attorneys and various other service providers, including but not limited to, the Fund's investment adviser, administrator and other such third parties servicing the Fund. 
The Board has three standing committees, each of which enhances the leadership structure of the Board: the Audit Committee; the Executive Committee; and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are each chaired by, and composed of, members who are Independent Trustees. The Executive Committee consists of two Independent Trustees and one Interested Trustee. 
Oversight of Risk Management 
The Fund is confronted with a multitude of risks, such as investment risk, counter party risk, valuation risk, political risk, risk of operational failures, business continuity risk, regulatory risk, legal risk and other risks not listed here. The Board recognizes that not all risk that may affect the Fund can be known, eliminated or even mitigated. In addition, there are some risks that may not be cost effective or an efficient use of the Fund's limited resources to moderate. As a result of these realities, the Board, through its oversight and leadership, has and will continue to deem it necessary for shareholders of the Fund to bear certain and undeniable risks, such as investment risk, in order for the Fund to operate in accordance with its prospectus, statement of additional information and other related documents.  
However, as required under the 1940 Act, the Board has adopted on the Fund's behalf a risk program that mandates the Fund's various service providers, including the investment adviser, to adopt a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various risks, mitigate the likelihood of such adverse events from occurring and/or attempt to limit the effects of such adverse events on the Fund. The Board fulfills its leadership role by receiving a variety of quarterly written reports prepared by the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") that (1) evaluate the operation, policies and procedures of the Fund's service providers, (2) makes known any material changes to the policies and procedures adopted by the Fund or its service providers since the CCO's last report, and (3) disclose any material compliance matters that occurred since the date of the last CCO report. In addition, the Independent Trustees meet quarterly in executive sessions without the presence of any Interested Trustees, the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of their affiliates. This configuration permits the Independent Trustees to effectively receive information and have private discussions necessary to perform its risk oversight role, exercise independent judgment, and allocate areas of responsibility between the full Board, its various committees and certain officers of the Fund. Furthermore the Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel and auditors to assist the Independent Trustees in performing their oversight responsibilities. As discussed above and in consideration of other factors not referenced herein, the Board has determined its leadership role concerning risk management, as one of oversight and not active management of the Fund's day-to-day risk management operations.

As of December 31, 2018, neither Independent Trustees/Nominees (as such term is defined by the NYSE American LLC listing standards ("NYSE American")) nor members of their immediate families owned securities, beneficially or of record, of Reaves Asset Management (the "Adviser"), or an affiliate or person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser. In addition, over the past five years, neither Independent Trustees/Nominees nor members of their immediate families have had any direct or indirect interest, the value of which exceeds $120,000, in the Adviser or any of its affiliates. Further, during each of the last two fiscal years, neither Independent Trustees/Nominees nor members of their immediate families have conducted any transactions (or series or transactions) or maintained any direct or indirect relationship in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and to which the Adviser or any of its affiliates was a party.  
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The role of the Fund's Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of (i) the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements, reporting process and the independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent accountants") and reviews thereof, (ii) the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain service providers, (iii) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and (iv) the independent accountants' qualifications, independence and performance. The Audit Committee is also required to prepare an audit committee report pursuant to the rules of the  SEC for inclusion in the Fund's annual proxy statement. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter (the "Charter") that was most recently reviewed and approved by the Board on September 17, 2018. The Charter is available at the Fund's website, www.utilityincomefund.com. As set forth in the Charter, management is responsible for maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the Fund's independent accountants are responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. The independent accountants are ultimately accountable to the Board and to the Audit Committee, as representatives of shareholders. The independent accountants for the Fund report directly to the Audit Committee. 
Based on the findings of the Board, the Board has determined that it has two "audit committee financial experts," as defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, and as required by the NYSE American listing standards; namely, Messrs. Deems and Holland. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee is composed of all five of the Fund's Independent Trustees (as such term is defined by the NYSE American listing standards); namely, Ms. Mary K. Anstine and Messrs. Jeremy W. Deems, Michael F. Holland, E. Wayne Nordberg and Larry W. Papasan. None of the members of the Audit Committee is an "interested person" of the Fund. 
Audit Committee Report 
At a meeting held on December 17, 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management of the Fund and the independent accountants, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), the audited financial statements of the Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and discussed the audit of such financial statements with Deloitte. 
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent accountants the accounting principles applied by the Fund and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by the independent accountants required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee also received from the independent accountants the written disclosures and letters required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence) and discussed the relationships between Deloitte and the Fund and the impact that any such relationships might have on the objectivity and independence of Deloitte.  
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Fund's independent accountants. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the Fund's independent accountants, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

Anstine and Messrs. Jeremy W. Deems, Michael F. Holland, E. Wayne Nordberg, and Larry W. Papasan.

Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board individuals believed to be qualified to become Trustees in the event that a position is vacated or created. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider Trustee candidates recommended by shareholders. In considering candidates submitted by shareholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board, the qualifications of the candidate and the interests of shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not determined any minimum qualifications necessary to serve as a Trustee of the Fund, nor has it adopted a formal diversity policy, but it may consider diversity of professional experience, education and skills when evaluating potential nominees. Any notice by a shareholder that the shareholder wishes to recommend a person for election as a Trustee must include: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual or special meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual or special meeting; (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Fund's books, of the shareholder proposing such business or nomination; (iii) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Fund entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to present such proposal or nomination; (iv) the class and number of shares of the capital stock of the Fund, which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and, if applicable, the proposed nominee to the Board; (v) any material interest of the shareholder or nominee in such business; (vi) the extent to which such shareholder (including such shareholder's principals) or the proposed nominee to the Board has entered into any hedging transaction or other arrangement with the effect or intent of mitigating or otherwise managing profit, loss or risk of changes in the value of the common stock or the daily quoted market price of the Fund held by such shareholder (including such shareholder's principals) or the proposed nominee, including independently verifiable information in support of the foregoing; and (vii) in the case of a nomination of any person for election as a Trustee, such other information regarding such nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act. 
The shareholder recommendation described above must be sent to the Fund's Secretary c/o ALPS Fund Services, Inc. The Fund's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a charter and is available on the Fund's website www.utilityincomefund.com.

The Fund's Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by Deloitte to the Fund and all non-audit services to be provided by Deloitte to the Adviser and service providers controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser ("Affiliates") that provide on-going services to the Fund (a "Covered Services Provider"), if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Chairman must report to the Audit Committee, at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairman's pre-approval of such services, his decision(s). The Audit  
Committee may also establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws, including the delegation of some or all of the Audit Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other than the Adviser or the Fund's officers). Pre-approval by the Audit Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Adviser and any Covered Services Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its independent accountants during the fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee or the Chairman prior to the completion of the audit.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require the Trustees and officers of the Fund, officers and Directors of the Adviser, affiliated persons of the Adviser, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's Shares ("Covered Persons"), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE American and to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the reports filed with the SEC and upon representations from all Covered Persons, the Fund believes that during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable for Covered Persons were complied with. 
BROKER NON-VOTES AND ABSTENTIONS 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of votes cast for each Nominee by the holders entitled to vote for a particular Nominee is necessary for the election of a Nominee. 
For the purpose of electing Nominees, abstentions or broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the election. Abstentions or broker non-votes, however, will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. 
Shareholders of the Fund will be informed of the voting results of the Meeting in the Fund's Semi-Annual Report dated April 30, 2019.  
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING 
The Trustees of the Fund do not intend to present any other business at the Meeting, nor are they aware that any shareholder intends to do so. If, however, any other matters, including adjournments, are properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their judgment. 
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD 
Shareholders may mail written communications to the Board, to committees of the Board or to specified individual Trustees in care of the Secretary of the Fund, 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, Colorado 80203. All shareholder communications received by the Secretary will be forwarded promptly to the Board, the relevant Board committee or the specified individual Trustees, as applicable, except that the Secretary may, in good faith, determine that a shareholder communication should not be so forwarded if it does not reasonably relate to the Fund or its operations, management, activities, policies, service providers, board, officers, shareholders or other matters relating to an investment in the Fund or is ministerial in nature. 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Any shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in the Fund's proxy statement and form of proxy for the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2020 should be received by the Secretary of the Fund no later than December 1, 2019. In addition, pursuant to the Fund's By-Laws, a shareholder is required to give to the Fund notice of, and specified information with respect to, any proposals that such shareholder intends to present at the 2020 annual meeting no earlier than November 1, 2019 and no later than December 1, 2019. Under the circumstances described in, and upon compliance with, Rule 14a-4(c) under the 1934 Act, the Fund may solicit proxies in connection with the 2020 annual meeting which confer discretionary authority to vote on any shareholder proposals of which the Secretary of the Fund does not receive notice in accordance with the aforementioned dates. Timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee that such proposal will be included. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
Shareholders who share the same address and last name may receive only one copy of the proxy materials unless Broadridge, in the case of shareholders of record, or such shareholder's broker, bank or nominee, in the case of shareholders whose Shares are held in street name, has received contrary instructions. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce printing and mailing costs. Shareholders desiring to discontinue householding and receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, may (1) if their Shares are held in street name, notify their broker, bank or nominee or (2) if they are shareholders of record, direct a written request to Broadridge. 
IF VOTING BY MAIL, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PROXIES BE RETURNED PROMPTLY. SHAREHOLDERS WHO DO NOT EXPECT TO ATTEND THE MEETING ARE THEREFORE URGED TO COMPLETE, SIGN, DATE AND RETURN THE PROXY CARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.
