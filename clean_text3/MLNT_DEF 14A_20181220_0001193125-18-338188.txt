As previously announced, on November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Vatera Healthcare Partners LLC ("Vatera"), pursuant to which Vatera committed to purchase shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $75 million, drawable at the Company's option and to be used for general corporate purposes. On November 19, 2018, the Company and Vatera entered into a definitive purchase agreement (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement") reflecting the commitment providing for the sale of an aggregate of $75 million of Melinta common stock, subject to the adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex B. The sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation as described below and the approval of the stockholders of the Company requested herein. 
At the Special Meeting, the Company will ask its stockholders to consider and vote upon proposals (i) to approve an amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000, a portion of which will be able to accommodate the sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement; (ii) to approve the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for purposes of applicable Nasdaq rules; and (iii) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposals above, as well as any other items that may properly come before the meeting. 
After careful consideration, Melinta's board of directors has unanimously approved the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation and the non-Vatera members of the board of directors of Melinta have approved the Purchase Agreement and have determined that they are advisable, fair and in the best interests of Melinta and its stockholders. Accordingly, Melinta's board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposals set forth in this proxy statement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the Purchase Agreement?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  As previously announced, on November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Vatera,  pursuant to which Vatera committed to purchase shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $75 million, drawable at the Company's option and to be used for general corporate purposes. On  November 19, 2018, the Company and Vatera entered into the Purchase Agreement reflecting the commitment providing for the sale of an aggregate of $75 million of shares, subject to the adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, a copy of  which is attached hereto as Annex B. The purchase price per share for the sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement will be equal to the lower of (i) $2.66 or (ii) the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common  stock on the Nasdaq Global Market for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the closing under the Purchase Agreement. The sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the  amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation as described below, the approval of the stockholders of the Company requested herein, the listing of the shares purchased under the Purchase Agreement on the Nasdaq Global Market, the absence  of a material adverse effect on the Company and the absence of an "Event of Default" under the Facility Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2018, by and among the Company, Cortland Capital Market Services LLC and the loan parties and lenders  party thereto from time to time (the "Credit Agreement"). The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and indemnities. Vatera and its assignees will be entitled to registration rights in respect of the shares  purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 3, 2017, among the Company, Vatera and the other parties thereto (the "Registration Right Agreement").  Vatera may assign all or a portion of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement to one or more affiliated investment funds or other co-investors ("assignees") without the Company's consent,  but no such assignment will relieve Vatera of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement will terminate if, among others, closing has not occurred by December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
For a more complete description of the Purchase Agreement, please see the section entitled "Summary of the Purchase Agreement" beginning on page 7 of this proxy statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why is Melinta seeking stockholder approval to issue shares of common stock in connection with the Purchase  Agreement?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Because Melinta common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, Melinta is subject to the Nasdaq Listing  Rules, including Rules 5635(b) and (d). Rule 5635(d) requires stockholder approval of certain transactions that result in the issuance of 20% or more of the outstanding voting power or shares of common stock outstanding before the issuance of stock  or securities. Since more than 20% of the outstanding common stock will be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Melinta is seeking stockholder approval of this issuance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  When do you expect the stock purchase transaction to be consummated?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We anticipate that the consummation of the transaction will occur as promptly as practicable after the Special  Meeting and following satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions. However, the exact timing of the consummation of the transaction is not yet known.  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  May I vote in person?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a stockholder of Melinta and your shares of Melinta common stock are registered directly in your  name with Melinta's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and the proxy materials and proxy card are being sent directly to you by Melinta. If you are a  Melinta stockholder of record, you may attend the Special Meeting and vote your shares in person, rather than signing and returning your proxy. If your shares of Melinta common stock are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered  the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the proxy materials are being forwarded to you together with a voting instruction card by such bank, broker or other nominee. As the beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend  the Special Meeting. Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a proxy from your broker issued in your name giving you the right to vote the shares at  the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If my Melinta shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting  instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares. Since the Proposals are considered "non-routine" matters, your broker will not be able to vote your shares of Melinta common stock without  specific instructions from you.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held by your broker or other agent as your nominee, you will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker or other agent to vote your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I cast my vote if I am a stockholder of record?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a stockholder with shares registered in your name with Melinta's transfer agent, Computershare  Trust Company, N.A., on the record date, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting or vote by proxy by telephone or internet or by mail. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, please vote as soon as possible to ensure your vote  is counted. You may still attend the Special Meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy. For more detailed instructions on how to vote using one of these methods, please see the section of this proxy statement entitled  "The Special Meeting—Voting Procedures" beginning on page 10.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, dealer or other similar  organization, you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from Melinta. Simply complete and mail the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted. Alternatively, you  may vote by telephone or over the internet as instructed by your broker

Q:  How many votes do I have?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of Melinta common stock you hold as of the  record date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if I return a proxy card but do not make specific choices?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you return a signed and dated proxy card without marking any voting selection, your shares will be voted  "FOR" the Proposals and the adjournment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What constitutes a quorum for purposes of the Special Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if stockholders holding  at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote are present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. On the record date, there were 56,020,254 shares of Melinta common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to  vote. Accordingly, the holders of 28,010,128 shares must be present at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. Your shares will be counted toward the quorum at the Special Meeting only if you vote in person at the meeting, you submit a valid proxy  vote or your broker, bank, dealer or similar organization submits a valid proxy vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  May I change my vote after I have submitted a proxy or provided proxy instructions?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Any Melinta stockholder of record voting by proxy, other than those Melinta stockholders who have executed  voting agreements, has the right to revoke his, her or its proxy at any time before the polls close at the Special Meeting by sending a written notice stating that he, she or it would like to revoke his, her or its proxy to the Corporate Secretary  of Melinta, by providing a duly executed proxy card bearing a later date than the proxy being revoked or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person. Attendance alone at the Special Meeting will not revoke a proxy. If a stockholder of  Melinta has instructed a broker to vote its shares of Melinta common stock that are held in "street name," the stockholder must follow directions received from its broker to change those instructions.

Provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Melinta common stock is required for the approval of the Proposal to amend Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000. 
Provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting is required for the approval of the Proposal to approve the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of applicable Nasdaq rules. 
Provided a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting is required to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Proposals above.

If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. These matters are referred to as "non-routine" matters. The Proposals and the adjournment are each a "non-routine" matter. 
This solicitation is made on behalf of Melinta's board of directors and Melinta will pay for the costs of solicitation. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries holding shares in their names that are beneficially owned by others so that they may forward the solicitation materials to such beneficial owners upon request. You will need to obtain your own internet access if you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the internet. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Melinta's directors, executive officers and employees might solicit proxies personally and by telephone. None of these individuals will receive any additional compensation for this. Melinta has engaged Georgeson to assist Melinta in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes described above for a fee of $17,500, plus additional fees based on the amount and types of services rendered and reimbursement of reasonable expenses. Melinta will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their principals and obtaining their proxies. 
Summary of the Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation 
As of November 26, 2018, there were (i) 80,000,000 shares of Melinta common stock authorized and 56,020,254 shares of Melinta common stock issued and outstanding (together with a total of 10,210,477 shares of Melinta common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units) and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of Melinta preferred stock authorized and no shares of Melinta preferred stock issued and outstanding. The amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation attached hereto as Annex A would increase Melinta's total number of authorized shares of all classes of capital stock from 85,000,000 shares to 160,000,000 shares, which would consist of (a) 155,000,000 shares of Melinta common stock and (b) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The amendment is intended to provide adequate authorized share capital (x) to accommodate the issuance of shares of Melinta common stock under the Purchase Agreement; and (y) to provide flexibility for future issuances of Melinta common stock if determined by Melinta's board of directors to be in the best interests of the Company without incurring the risk, delay and potential expense incident to obtaining stockholder approval for a particular issuance. 
Summary of the Purchase Agreement 
On November 6, 2018, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Vatera, pursuant to which Vatera committed to purchase shares of the Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $75 million, drawable at the Company's option and to be used for general corporate purposes. On November 19, 2018, the Company and Vatera entered into the Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Annex B reflecting the commitment providing for the sale of an aggregate of $75 million of shares, subject to the adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for the sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement will be equal to the lower of (i) $2.66 or (ii) the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the closing under the Purchase Agreement. The sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including, without limitation, the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation as described above, the approval of the stockholders of the Company requested herein, the listing of the shares purchased under the Purchase Agreement on the Nasdaq Global Market, the absence of a material adverse effect on the Company and the absence of an "Event of Default" under the Credit Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, covenants and indemnities. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed, without the prior written consent of Vatera, for a period ending ninety (90) days after the closing under the Purchase Agreement, not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of, or file a registration statement relating to, any common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchange for common stock, subject to certain 
- 7 - 
 exceptions. Vatera and its assignees will be entitled to registration rights in respect of the shares purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. Vatera may assign all or a portion of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement to one or more assignees without the Company's consent, but no such assignment will relieve Vatera of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement will terminate if, among others, closing has not occurred by December 31, 2018. The summary of the Purchase Agreement set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex B. 
Interests of Melinta's Directors and Executive Officers in the Proposals 
In considering the recommendation of Melinta's board of directors with respect to the Proposals to be acted upon by Melinta stockholders at the Special Meeting, Melinta stockholders should be aware that certain members of the board of directors of Melinta have interests in the Purchase Agreement that may be different from, or in addition to, interests they may have as Melinta stockholders. 
As noted under "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement, as of November 26, 2018, Vatera Holdings LLC ("Vatera Holdings") beneficially owned approximately 29.6% of the outstanding shares of Melinta common stock. Kevin Ferro, a current director of Melinta, is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and the managing member of Vatera Holdings, the manager of Vatera; and Thomas Koestler, a current director of Melinta, is an Executive Director of Vatera Holdings. For illustrative purposes, in the event the purchase price per share under the Purchase Agreement is $2.66 and Vatera or its affiliates purchase all $75 million of the shares under the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex B, Vatera Holdings would beneficially own approximately 53.2% of the outstanding shares of Melinta common stock immediately following the closing under the Purchase Agreement (based on 56,020,254 shares of Melinta common stock outstanding as of November 26, 2018 and after giving effect to the issuance under the Purchase Agreement). On a fully diluted basis, Vatera Holdings would beneficially own approximately 47.4% of the Melinta common stock immediately following the closing under the Purchase Agreement (based on 56,202,254 shares of Melinta common stock outstanding on November 26, 2018, 10,210,477 shares of Melinta common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units outstanding as of November 26, 2018 and after giving effect to the issuance under the Purchase Agreement). 
The terms of the Purchase Agreement were reviewed and approved by the non-Vatera members of Melinta's board of directors, who constituted a quorum of the Board and voted upon the matter in the absence of the Vatera-related directors.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 
Melinta is furnishing this proxy statement to its stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by Melinta's board of directors for use at the Special Meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
Date, Time and Place 
The Special Meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on December 20, 2018, at 44 Whippany Road in Morristown, New Jersey. 
If you are a holder of record and plan to attend the Special Meeting, please bring your proxy or a photo identification to confirm your identity. If you are a beneficial owner of common stock held by a bank or broker, i.e., in "street name," you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote in person your common stock held in "street name," you must get a proxy in your name from the registered holder. 
Purpose of the Special Meeting 
The purpose of the Special Meeting is to consider and act upon proposals (i) to approve an amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000; (ii) to approve the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of applicable Nasdaq rules; and (iii) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposals above, as well as any other items that may properly come before the meeting. 
Recommendation of Melinta's Board of Directors 
After careful consideration, Melinta's board of directors unanimously recommends that Melinta stockholders vote "FOR" the proposals (i) to approve an amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000; (ii) to approve the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of applicable Nasdaq rules; and (iii) to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposals above, as well as any other items that may properly come before the meeting. 
Record Date and Stockholders Entitled to Vote 
Only holders of record of shares of Melinta common stock at the close of business on November 26, 2018, the record date for the Special Meeting, are entitled to vote the shares of Melinta common stock they held on the record date at the Special Meeting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 56,020,254 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, held by approximately 50 stockholders of record. Each holder of record is entitled to one vote for each share of Melinta common stock held by such stockholder on the record date on the proposals presented in this proxy statement. 
Voting Procedures 
If your common stock is held by a broker, bank or other nominee, they should send you instructions that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. If you hold shares in your own name, please vote via (i) the internet using the secure website provided on your proxy card; (ii) by phone using the toll-free number provided on your proxy card; or (iii) by sending in your proxy card using the included return envelope. 
- 10 - 
The internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities by use of a control number to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been properly recorded. Voting via the internet or telephone must be completed by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time on December 19, 2018. Of course, you can always come to the meeting and vote your shares in person. If you submit or return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by Melinta's board of directors. 
Melinta is not aware of any other matters to be presented at the meeting, except for those described in this proxy statement. If any matters not described in this proxy statement are presented at the meeting, your proxyholder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the meeting is adjourned, your proxyholder may vote your shares on the new meeting date as well, unless you revoke your proxy instructions before then. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please vote as soon as possible to ensure your vote is counted. 
Revoking Your Proxy Instructions 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy before your shares are voted at the meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Filing a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy with Melinta's Corporate Secretary  at Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., 44 Whippany Road, Morristown, New Jersey 07963, Attn: Investor Relations at or before the taking of the vote at the meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Duly executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to Melinta's Corporate  Secretary at Melinta Therapeutics, Inc., 44 Whippany Road, Morristown, New Jersey 07963, Attn: Investor Relations at or before the taking of the vote at the meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attending the meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the meeting will not in and of itself  constitute a revocation of a proxy).  
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your bank, broker, nominee or trustee. You may also vote in person at the meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from them. 
Counting Votes 
Consistent with state law and Melinta's bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum for purposes of voting on a particular matter at the meeting. On the record date, there were 56,020,254 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Accordingly, the holders of 28,010,128 shares must be present at the Special Meeting to have a quorum. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and any adjournment thereof unless a new record date is set for the adjournment. Shares held of record by stockholders or their nominees who do not vote by proxy or attend the meeting in person will not be considered present or represented and will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. Signed proxies that withhold authority or reflect abstentions or "broker non-votes" will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. "Broker non-votes" are proxies received from brokerage firms or other nominees holding shares on behalf of their clients who have not been given specific voting instructions from their clients with respect to non-routine matters. If there is no quorum, the chairperson of the meeting or any officer entitled to preside at or to act as secretary of the meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting to another date. 
Assuming the presence of a quorum at the meeting, (i) the approval of the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 
- 11 - 
 80,000,000 to 155,000,000 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Melinta common stock, (ii) the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of applicable Nasdaq rules requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting, and (iii) the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies, in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposals above, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting or such other threshold as required by any such other items. 
An abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of these proposals. A "broker non-vote" will have no effect on (i) the proposal to approve the issuance and sale of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for the purpose of applicable Nasdaq rules, and (ii) the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies. A "broker non-vote" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation. 
With respect to "non-routine" matters, a bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee is not permitted under the SRO rules to vote its clients' shares if the clients do not provide instructions. The bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee will so note on the voting instruction form, and this constitutes a "broker non-vote." "Broker non-votes" will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum to conduct business at the meeting, but not for determining the number of shares voted "FOR," "AGAINST," "ABSTAINING" or "WITHHELD FROM" with respect to such non-routine matters. 
In summary, if you do not vote your proxy, your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee may either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• cast a "broker non-vote" on  non-routine matters; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• leave your shares unvoted altogether.  
[END TABLE]
Melinta encourages you to provide instructions to your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee by voting your proxy. This action ensures that your shares will be voted in accordance with your wishes at the meeting. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
Melinta will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. You will need to obtain your own internet access if you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the internet. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Melinta's directors, executive officers and employees might solicit proxies personally and by telephone. None of these individuals will receive any additional compensation for this. Melinta has engaged Georgeson to assist Melinta in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes described above for a fee of $17,500, plus additional fees based on the amount and types of services rendered and reimbursement of reasonable expenses. Melinta will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their principals and obtaining their proxies. 
Adjournments and Postponements 
The Special Meeting may be adjourned, recessed or postponed if a quorum is not present. 
If the time, date and place of an adjourned meeting are announced at the original convening of the Special Meeting, no notice of an adjourned meeting need be given unless, after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which case notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At any subsequent reconvening of the Special Meeting at which a quorum is present in person or represented by proxy, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting, and all proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the Special Meeting, except for any proxies that have been validly revoked or withdrawn prior to the reconvened meeting.

MATTERS BEING SUBMITTED TO A VOTE OF MELINTA STOCKHOLDERS 
PROPOSAL 1: AMENDMENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
General 
As of November 26, 2018, there were (i) 80,000,000 shares of Melinta common stock authorized and 56,020,254 shares of Melinta common stock issued and outstanding (together with a total of 10,210,477 shares of Melinta common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the vesting of restricted stock units) and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of Melinta preferred stock authorized and no shares of Melinta preferred stock issued and outstanding. The amendment would increase Melinta's total number of authorized shares of all classes of capital stock from 85,000,000 shares to 160,000,000 shares, which would consist of (a) 155,000,000 shares of Melinta common stock and (b) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 
The amendment is intended to provide adequate authorized share capital to: (i) accommodate the issuance of shares of Melinta common stock under the Purchase Agreement; and (ii) to provide flexibility for future issuances of Melinta common stock if determined by Melinta's board of directors to be in the best interests of the Company without incurring the risk, delay and potential expense incident to obtaining stockholder approval for a particular issuance. 
By approving this Proposal 1, Melinta stockholders are also approving the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation, attached hereto as Annex A, reflecting the amendments contemplated by this Proposal 1. All Melinta stockholders are encouraged to read the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation in its entirety. 
Approval of Proposal 1 is required to implement the issuance of Melinta common stock contemplated by Proposal 2, provided that approval of Proposal 2 is not a condition to the approval and implementation of Proposal 1. 
Voting by Proxyholder 
Your proxyholder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your common stock in accordance with your instructions. Unless you give specific instructions to the contrary, your common stock will be voted "FOR" the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000. 
Required Vote; Recommendation of Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Melinta common stock as of the record date is required for approval of the amendment to Melinta's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Melinta common stock from 80,000,000 to 155,000,000. A failure to submit a proxy card or vote at the Special Meeting, an abstention or a "broker non-vote" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of this Proposal 1. 
MELINTA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT MELINTA STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL 1 TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO MELINTA'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM 80,000,000 TO 155,000,000.

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL OF THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK 
General 
At the Special Meeting, Melinta stockholders will be asked to approve the issuance of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for purposes of applicable Nasdaq rules. 
On November 19, 2018, the Company and Vatera entered into the Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Annex B, reflecting the commitment providing for the sale of an aggregate of $75 million of Melinta common stock, subject to the adjustment as set forth in the purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share for the sale of shares under the Purchase Agreement will be equal to the lower of (i) $2.66 or (ii) the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the closing under the Purchase Agreement.

Vatera and its assignees will be entitled to registration rights in respect of the shares purchased pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. Vatera may assign all or a portion of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement to one or more assignees without the Company's consent, but no such assignment will relieve Vatera of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement will terminate if, among others, closing has not occurred by December 31, 2018. The summary of the Purchase Agreement set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex B. 
The issuance of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as contemplated by this Proposal 2 will only be implemented if Proposal 1 is approved. 
Voting by Proxyholder 
Your proxyholder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your common stock in accordance with your instructions. Unless you give specific instructions to the contrary, your common stock will be voted "FOR" the issuance of Melinta common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as contemplated by the Vatera commitment letter. 
Required Vote; Recommendation of Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter at the Special Meeting is required for approval of this Proposal 2. A "broker non-vote" will have no effect on the outcome of this Proposal 2, while an abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the approval of this Proposal 2. 
THE NON-VATERA MEMBERS OF MELINTA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT MELINTA STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL 2 TO APPROVE THE ISSUANCE OF MELINTA COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

If Melinta fails to receive a sufficient number of votes to approve the other Proposals, Melinta may propose to adjourn the Special Meeting, if a quorum is present, for a period of not more than 30 days for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to approve the other Proposals. Melinta currently does not intend to propose adjournment at the Special Meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the other Proposals. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Melinta common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the Special Meeting is required to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies to approve the other Proposals.

RECENT CHANGE OF CONTROL OF REGISTRANT 
On November 3, 2017, Cempra, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cempra"), merged with then privately-held Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. ("Private Melinta") in a reverse triangular merger, wherein Private Melinta became a subsidiary of Cempra, in accordance with the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of August 8, 2017, as amended on each of September 6, 2017 and October 24, 2017 (as so amended, the "Merger Agreement") by and among Cempra, Private Melinta and Castle Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cempra ("Merger Sub"). On November 3, 2017, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Private Melinta, with Private Melinta surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Cempra (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger and after giving effect to a 5-to-1 reverse stock split effected immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Private Melinta's common stock automatically converted into the right to receive approximately 0.0229 shares of Cempra common stock. Concurrently with the effectiveness of the Merger, Cempra changed its name to Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. and Private Melinta changed its name to Melinta Subsidiary Corp. 
Following the closing of the Merger, pre-closing Private Melinta stockholders owned, on a fully-diluted basis as calculated under the treasury stock method, approximately 51.6% of Company common stock and pre-closing Cempra stockholders owned approximately 48.4% of Company common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, prior to the closing of the Merger but effective at the effective time of the Merger, the board of directors of the Company increased the size of the board of directors to nine directors. On November 3, 2017, effective at the effective time of the Merger, Michael Dougherty, Dov A. Goldstein, M.D., Richard Kent, M.D. and P. Sherrill Neff resigned from the Company's board of directors, and Kevin T. Ferro, Jay Galeota, Cecilia Gonzalo and Thomas P. Koestler, Ph.D., were appointed to the Company's board of directors. The directors presently serving on the board of directors of the Company are Bruce L. Downey, Mr. Ferro, Mr. Galeota, David Gill, John H. Johnson, Dr. Koestler, Garheng Kong, M.D., Ph.D., and David Zaccardelli, Pharm. D.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other person authorized by the Company to act on its behalf, has engaged in a general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Regulation D of the Securities Act) of investors with respect to offer or sales of the Shares and neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any person acting on its behalf, has made any offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security, under circumstances that would cause the offering or issuance of the Shares under this Agreement to be integrated with prior offerings by the Company for purposes of the Securities Act that would result in Regulation D or any other applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act not being available, nor will the Company take any action or steps that would cause the offering or issuance of the Shares under this Agreement to be integrated with other offerings.

Each of the SEC Documents as of its respective date complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in any SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed SEC Document filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 
(2) The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with the SEC and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's outside auditors and the Board of Director's audit committee (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 
B-4

(4) The internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company was effective at December 31, 2017, and since December 31, 2017 there have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
(g) Brokers and Finders. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or indirectly for the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 
(h) Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has taken no action designed to, or which to the Knowledge of the Company is reasonably likely to, have the effect of terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act nor has the Company received as of the date of this Agreement any notification that the SEC is contemplating terminating such registration. 
(i) No Additional Representations. Except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in this Section 2.1, neither the Company nor any other person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, employees, employee benefit plans, conditions or prospects, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Purchaser and its Affiliates to rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, nor will anything in this Agreement operate to limit any claim by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for fraud.

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its terms (except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles). 
(2) Neither the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof, will (A) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the material properties or assets of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, (i) any organizational documents of the Purchaser or (ii) any material contract to which the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which it may be bound, or to which the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or any of the properties or assets of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries may be subject, or (B) violate any Law applicable to the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (A)(ii) and (B) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, termination or acceleration as would not reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis. 
(3) Other than filings with the SEC related to the acquisition of the Shares or as required by the securities or blue sky laws of the various states, no notice to, registration, declaration or filing with, exemption or review by, or authorization, order, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity, nor expiration or termination of any statutory waiting period, is necessary for the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Purchaser (1) acknowledges that it is acquiring the Shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act solely for investment with no present intention to distribute any of the Shares to any person in violation of applicable securities laws, (2) will not sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, except in compliance with the registration requirements or exemption provisions of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws, (3) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and in investments of this type that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Shares and of making an informed investment decision, (4) is an "accredited investor" (as that term is defined by Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of the Securities Act), and (5) (A) has been furnished with or has had full access to all the information that it considers necessary or appropriate to make an informed investment decision with respect to the Shares, (B) has had an opportunity to discuss with management of the Company the intended business and financial affairs of the Company and to obtain information (to the extent the Company possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense) necessary to verify any information furnished to it or to which it had access and (C) can bear the economic risk of (x) an investment in the Shares indefinitely and (y) a total loss in respect of such investment. The Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in business and financial matters so as to enable it to understand and evaluate the risks of and form an investment decision with respect to, its investment in the Shares and to protect its own interest in connection with such investment. 
(d) Financial Capability. The Purchaser at the Closing will have available funds necessary to consummate the Closing on the terms and conditions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is not aware of any reason why the funds sufficient to fulfill its obligations under Article I will not be available on the Closing Date. 
B-6

Except for the representations and warranties made by the Purchaser in this Section 2.2, neither the Purchaser nor any other person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Purchaser or its businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, employees, employee benefit plans, conditions or prospects, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Company and its Affiliates to rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, nor will anything in this Agreement operate to limit any claim by the Company or any of its Affiliates for fraud.

5.2 Indemnification by the Purchaser. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify the Company and its officers, directors, managers, employees, and agents (collectively, "Company Related Parties") 
B-9 
 from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all Losses, and, in connection therewith, and promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, losses, liabilities, damages or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or asserted against or involve any of them), whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, incurred by or asserted against such Company Related Parties as a result of or arising out of (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by the Purchaser contained in Sections 2.2 to be true and correct or (ii) the breach of any of the covenants of the Purchaser contained herein; provided that in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i), such claim for indemnification relating to a breach of any representation or warranty is made prior to the expiration of such representation or warranty as set forth in Section 5.5; provided, further that for purposes of determining when an indemnification claim has been made, the date upon which a Company Related Party shall have given written notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the Purchaser shall constitute the date upon which such claim has been made. 
5.3 Indemnification Procedure. 
(a) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 
(b) Promptly after any Company Related Party or Purchaser Related Party (hereinafter, the "Indemnified Party") has received notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a third person, which the Indemnified Party believes in good faith is an indemnifiable claim under this Agreement (each, a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give the indemnitor hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice of such Third Party Claim but failure or delay to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Such notice shall state the nature and the basis of such Third Party Claim to the extent then known. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of, and settle, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to assume and control the defense or settle such Third Party Claim, it shall promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) business days after notice of such claim, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in all reasonable respects in the defense thereof and/or the settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be limited to, furnishing the Indemnifying Party with any books, records and other information reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and in the Indemnified Party's possession or control. Such cooperation of the Indemnified Party shall be at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. After the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its intention to undertake to defend or settle any such asserted liability, and for so long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any defense or settlement of such asserted liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled (i) at its own expense, to participate in the defense of such asserted liability and any negotiations of the settlement thereof and (ii) if (A) the Indemnifying Party has, within fifteen (15) business days after the Indemnified Party provides written notice of a Third Party Claim, failed to (y) assume the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim and (z) notify the Indemnified Party of such assumption, or (B) the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and counsel to the Indemnified Party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party or if the interests of the Indemnified Party reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, then, in each case, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select one (1) separate counsel and, upon prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party, to assume such settlement or legal defense and otherwise to participate in the defense of such action, with the expenses and fees of such separate counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party as incurred. 
B-10 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release from liability of, and does not contain any admission of wrongdoing by, the Indemnified Party. 
5.4 Tax Matters. All indemnification payments under this Article V shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. 
5.5 Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive until December 31, 2019, except that (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Sections 2.1(a), 2.1(b), 2.1(c)(1), 2.1(e) and 2.1(g) will survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Purchaser contained in Sections 2.2(a), 2.2(b)(1), 2.2(c) and 2.2(e) will survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. All of the covenants or other agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive until fully performed or fulfilled, unless and to the extent that non-compliance with such covenants or agreements is waived in writing by the party entitled to such performance. 
5.6 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except in the case of fraud, no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party in excess of the Purchase Price, and neither party shall be liable for any exemplary or punitive damages or any other damages to the extent not reasonably foreseeable arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (in each case, unless any such damages are awarded pursuant to a Third Party Claim).

6.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the schedules hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes the Commitment Letter and all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and transactions contemplated hereby. 
6.8 Assignment; Co-Investors. 
(a) Except as set forth in Section 6.8(b), neither this Agreement, nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. 
(b) Subject to applicable securities Laws, the Purchaser may assign all or a portion of its obligations to fund the Purchase Price and purchase the Shares to one or more affiliated investment funds or other co-investors (which co-investors may include, for the avoidance of doubt, third party investors that are not affiliated with the Purchaser or its Affiliates) (any such assignee, an "Assignee") without obtaining the prior written consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of its obligations to fund the applicable portion of the Purchase Price hereunder in the event any Assignee fails to fund at the Closing.

For purposes of this definition, "control" (including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlled by" and "under common control with") when used with respect to any person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to cause the direction of management or policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

6.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any person (including the officers and directors of the parties hereto) or circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties. 
6.12 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

6.13 Public Announcements. Subject to each party's disclosure obligations imposed by law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange upon which its securities are listed, each of the parties hereto will cooperate with each other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public information disclosures with respect to this Agreement and any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither the Company nor the Purchaser will make any such news release or public disclosure without first consulting with the other, and, in each case, also receiving the other's consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and each party shall coordinate with the party whose consent is required with respect to any such news release or public disclosure. Once information has been made available to the general public in accordance with this Agreement, this Section shall no longer apply to such information. 
6.14 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, without the necessity of posting bond or other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or equity, and in the event that any action or suit is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, and no party will allege, and each party hereby waives, the defense or counterclaim that there is an adequate remedy at law. 
6.15 Termination. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may only be terminated: 
(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and the Purchaser; 
(b) by the Company or the Purchaser, upon written notice to the other party, if the Closing has not occurred by December 31, 2018; provided, however that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.15(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligations under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; or 
(c) by the Company or the Purchaser upon the consummation of any merger, purchase or otherwise where a third party acquires all of the capital stock of the Company. 
6.16 Effects of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.15, neither party (or any of its Affiliates) shall have any liability or obligation to the other (or any of its Affiliates) under or in respect of this Agreement, except to the extent of (A) any liability arising from any breach by such party of its obligations of this Agreement arising prior to such termination and (B) any fraud or intentional or willful breach of this Agreement. In the event of any such termination, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further

6.17 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto, including entities that become parties hereto after the date hereof, including permitted assignees and successors, or that agree in writing for the benefit of the Company to be bound by the terms of this Agreement applicable to the Purchaser, and no former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents or Affiliates of any party hereto or any former, current or future equityholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, advisor, agent or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a "Non-Recourse Party") shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party.
