PROXY STATEMENTOFPARKE BANCORP, INC.601 DELSEA DRIVEWASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY 08080
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERSApril 16, 2019
GENERAL
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors       of Parke Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), the bank holding company for Parke Bank, a New Jersey chartered commercial bank (the "Bank"), to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the Terra Nova restaurant, 590 Delsea Drive,       Washington Township, New Jersey, on April 16, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. (the "Annual Meeting"). The accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement are being first mailed to shareholders on or about March 15, 2019.
At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will consider and vote upon (i) the election of one director of the       Company to serve a one-year term and three directors of the Company each to serve three-year terms, and (ii) the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
The Board of Directors knows of no additional matters that will be presented for consideration at the       Annual Meeting. Execution of a proxy, however, confers on the designated proxy holder the discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by such proxy in accordance with their best judgment on such other business, if any, which may properly       come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
VOTING AND PROXY PROCEDURES
Who Can Vote at the Annual         Meeting
You are only entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting if our records show that you held shares of our       common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), as of the close of business on March 6, 2019 (the "Record Date"). If your shares are held by a broker or other intermediary, you can only vote your shares at the Annual Meeting if you have       a properly executed proxy from the record holder of your shares (or their designee). As of the Record Date, a total of 10,750,239 shares of Common Stock were outstanding. Each share of Common Stock has one vote on each matter presented.
Voting by Proxy
The Board of Directors is sending you this Proxy Statement for the purpose of requesting that you allow       your shares of Common Stock to be represented at the Annual Meeting by the persons named in the enclosed proxy card. As shown on your proxy card, you may also vote your shares by internet or telephone voting.  All shares of Common Stock represented       at the Annual Meeting by properly executed and dated proxies will be voted according to the instructions indicated on the proxy. If you execute a proxy (by any permitted method) without giving voting instructions, your shares will be voted as       recommended by the Company's Board of Directors. The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" its nominees for  directors         and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent auditors.
If any matters not described in this Proxy Statement are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the       persons named in the proxy will vote your shares as determined by a majority of the Board of Directors. If the Annual Meeting is postponed or adjourned, your shares of Common Stock may be voted by the persons named in the proxy card on the new Annual       Meeting dates as well, unless you have revoked your proxy. The Company does not know of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting.
You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. To revoke your       proxy you must advise the Company's Secretary in writing before your Common Stock has been voted at the Annual Meeting, deliver a later-dated proxy, or attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will       not in itself revoke your proxy.
If you hold your Common Stock in "street name," you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that       you must follow in order to have your shares voted. Your broker, bank or other nominee may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the Internet. Please see the instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee       that accompanies this Proxy Statement.  In order to vote at the Annual Meeting you will need special documentation from your broker, bank or other nominee.  Please note that pursuant to the rules that guide how brokers vote your stock, your brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the election of directors (Proposal I) without specific instructions from you as to         how to vote because it is not considered a "routine" matter under the applicable rules.
Vote Required
Business can only be transacted at the Annual Meeting if a majority of the outstanding shares of Common       Stock entitled to vote is represented at the Annual Meeting. If you execute a valid proxy or attend the Annual Meeting in person, your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum even if you abstain or withhold your       vote or do not vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does       not have discretionary voting power with respect to the agenda item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
In voting on the election of directors (Proposal I), you may vote in favor of the nominee or withhold       your vote. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors. Directors must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the nominee receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. Votes that       are withheld and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election.
In voting to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent auditors, you may vote in favor of       the proposal, against the proposal or abstain from voting. To be approved, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be counted as votes cast and will       have no effect on the voting on these proposals.
PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK
Persons and groups beneficially owning more than 5% of the Common Stock are required to file certain reports with the       Securities and Exchange Commission regarding their ownership. A person is the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock if he or she has or shares voting or investment power over the shares or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the       shares at any time within 60 days from the Record Date. The following table sets forth information as of the Record Date with respect to the persons or groups known to the       Company to beneficially own more than 5% of the Common Stock as well as directors and executive officers as a group.

Directors and Executive Officers   As a Group (14 persons) 1,916,105 (3)   17.69%  
 (1)   For purposes of this table, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock if he or she shares voting or                investment power with respect to such shares or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of the Record Date.  As used herein, "voting power" is the power to vote or direct the voting of shares and "investment power" is the                power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares.  Except as otherwise noted, ownership is direct and the named persons or group exercise sole voting or investment power over the shares of Common Stock.  
 (2)   In calculating the percentage ownership of an individual or group, the number of shares outstanding is deemed to include any shares                which the individual or group have the right to acquire within 60 days of the Record Date through the exercise of options or otherwise.  
 (3)   Includes 66,690 shares of Common Stock that may be acquired pursuant to the exercise of options and 16,880 shares of Common Stock that                may be acquired upon a full conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, in each case, within 60 days of the Record Date.  
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL I – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors currently consists of nine members divided into three classes and such classes are       supposed to be as nearly equal in number as possible. The directors are elected for staggered three-year terms, or until their successors are elected and qualified. Annually, approximately one-third of the board is to be elected.  In order to begin       to equalize the classes of directors, at last year's annual meeting, one of the four director nominees whose term expired at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders was nominated for a two-year term to expire in 2020, rather than a three-year term.        There are now two directors in the class of 2020, three directors in the class of 2021 and four directors in the class of 2019.  It is for this reason that we disclosed in last year's Proxy Statement that the Nominating Committee of the Board of       Directors may take additional actions with respect to the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders in order to fully equalize the Board, with the result that each class has three directors. Accordingly, at the Annual Meeting, shareholders will consider       and vote upon the election of one director of the Company to serve a one-year term and three directors of the Company each to serve three-year terms. If all the nominees for election as directors are elected at the Annual Meeting, each class will       have three directors and will be equally balanced.
It is intended that proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will, unless otherwise specified, be voted       for the election of the named nominees for the terms indicated. If any nominee is unable to serve, the shares represented by all valid proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute as the Board of Directors may recommend or the size of       the Board may be reduced to eliminate the vacancy. At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any nominee might be unavailable to serve.
The following table sets forth for the nominees, the directors continuing in office and certain executive and other senior       officers: name, age, the year the individual first became a director or officer of the Company, the term of office and the number and percentage of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each of them as of the Record Date.

Director Independence
The Board of Directors has determined that all non-employee Directors are independent in accordance       with the requirements of Nasdaq rules. All Board members who serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee       are non-employee Directors and deemed independent. The Board of Directors has determined that Director Choate is an Audit Committee Financial Expert within the meaning of the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Director Attendance
The Board of Directors conducts its business through meetings of the Board and through activities of       its committees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors met a total of twelve times, including regularly scheduled meetings and special meetings. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of the Board of       Directors and meetings of the committees on which he served during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics, which applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and the       Bank.  The Code of Ethics is available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website, www.parkebank.com. It is expected that all directors, officers and employees act in accordance with the highest standards of personal and professional       conduct in all aspects of their employment and association with the Company and the Bank, to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and to adhere to all policies and procedures adopted by the Company and the Bank.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Nominating           Committee. The nominating committee consists of Directors Choate, Dalton, Dobson and Infantolino.  The Nominating Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written nominating       committee charter for the Nominating Committee that is available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website, www.parkebank.com. The Company does not pay fees to any third party to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or       evaluating potential nominees. The process for identifying and evaluating potential Board nominees includes soliciting recommendations from directors and officers of the Company. Additionally, the Board will consider persons recommended by       shareholders of the Company in selecting the Board's nominees for election. There is no difference in the manner in which persons recommended by directors or officers versus persons recommended by shareholders in selecting Board nominees are       evaluated.
To be considered in the selection of Board nominees, recommendations from shareholders must be received by the Company in       writing by at least 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting.  Recommendations should identify the submitting shareholder, the person recommended for consideration and the reasons the submitting shareholder believes       such person should be considered. The Board believes potential directors should be knowledgeable about the business activities and market areas in which the Company engages. The committee and the Board of Directors may consider diversity in market       knowledge, experience, employment, and other factors.
Compensation           Committee. The Compensation Committee oversees the Company's executive compensation and benefit policies and practices. The Committee is comprised of Directors Choate, Dalton, Dobson, Infantolino, Jannetti, Kripitz, Pennoni and Sheppard.       The Committee met one time during the 2018 fiscal year. The Board of Directors has adopted a written compensation committee charter for the Compensation Committee that is available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website, www.parkebank.com.
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation philosophy, developing compensation guidelines,       establishing (or recommending to the entire Board of Directors) the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers. No executive officer participates with respect to decisions on his or her compensation. The Compensation       Committee may retain, at its discretion, compensation consultants to assist it in making compensation related decisions.
The Compensation Committee's goal is to determine appropriate compensation levels that will enable the Company to: (i)       attract, retain and motivate an experienced, competent executive management team; (ii)  reward the executive management team for the enhancement of stockholder value based on our annual performance and the market price of our stock; (iii) provide       compensation rewards that are adequately balanced between short-term and long-term performance goals; and (iv) maintain compensation levels that are competitive with other financial institutions, particularly those comparable in asset size and market       area.
The Compensation Committee considers a number of factors in their decisions regarding executive compensation, including, but       not limited to, the level of responsibility and performance of the individual executive officers and the overall performance of the Company. The Compensation Committee also considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer with respect to       the compensation of executive officers and on matters of compensation philosophy, plan design and general guidelines for employee compensation. However, the Chief Executive Officer does not vote on and is not present for any discussion of his own       compensation.
Audit         Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of the Company. The Committee is comprised of Directors Choate, Dalton, Dobson, and Sheppard. The Committee met four times in fiscal year 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written audit committee charter for the Audit       Committee that is available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website, www.parkebank.com.
Audit Committee Financial Expert. The Board of Directors has determined that Fred G. Choate is an Audit Committee       "financial expert" as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Choate is considered       an independent director, under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market including the specific independence requirements for audit committee members.
Shareholder Communications
The Board of Directors does not have a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the Board. In view of the       infrequency of shareholder communications to the Board of Directors, the Board does not believe that a formal process is necessary. Written communications received by the Company from shareholders are shared with the full Board no later than the next       regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board encourages, but does not require, directors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. All of the nine Board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in the Risk Management Process
Director Vito S. Pantilione serves as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Director Celestino R.       Pennoni serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors has determined that the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and President enhances Board independence and oversight. Moreover, the separation       of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and President allows the Chief Executive Officer and President to better focus on his growing responsibilities of running the Company, enhancing shareholder value and expanding and strengthening our       franchise while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management.
We face a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk,       operational risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks the Company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk       management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. To do this, the Chairman of       the Board meets regularly with management to discuss strategy and risks facing the Company. Senior management attends the Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management and any other       matters. The Chairman of the Board and independent members of the Board work together to provide strong, independent oversight of the Company's management and affairs through its Audit, Loan and Asset/Liability and Risk committees and, when       necessary, special meetings of independent directors.

Supplemental           Executive Retirements Plans. The Bank implemented a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") effective January 1, 2003 for Vito S. Pantilione, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. Pantilione's SERP, retirement benefits       are payable to him commencing upon retirement after attainment of age 60 at the rate of 50% of his highest base salary paid while an employee of the Bank for the remainder of his life. If such retirement benefit payments are made for less than ten       years, a survivor benefit will continue to be paid for the balance of such ten-year period. Such benefits are in addition to any social security benefits. Benefits under the plan may be paid in the form of a lump sum on an actuarially equivalent       basis. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a total accrued liability of $3.4 million with respect to benefits payable under Mr. Pantilione's SERP. Benefits under the SERP will be a tax-deductible expense to the Bank at the time that actual benefit       payments are made. The Bank has invested in various life insurance agreements (commonly known as BOLI, for bank-owned life insurance) with policy proceeds payable to the Bank in the event of the death of plan participants. Such insurance proceeds and       earnings related to such investments are anticipated to exceed any plan costs related to benefit payments.
On January 19, 2016, the Bank approved SERPs for Ms. Elizabeth A. Milavsky, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating       Officer, and John F. Hawkins, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Such SERP benefits when aggregated with projected Social Security benefits and Bank contributions to the 401(k) plan are projected to provide each participant with a       target total retirement benefit of 35% of final three year average salary upon retirement on or after December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the SERP for Ms. Milavsky, she will earn an annual supplemental retirement benefit equal to 23.23% of       her highest base salary in effect prior to retirement payable as a life annuity, with a minimum of an aggregate of ten annual payments certain payable to the officer or the officer's beneficiary. Mr. Hawkins' SERP benefit is calculated as 25.09% of       his highest annual base salary. Such benefits will be vested upon completion of additional years of continuous employment with the Bank through December 31, 2019. The projected annual benefit upon retirement on or after December 31, 2019, is $68,258       and $62,207 per year for each of Ms. Milavsky and Mr. Hawkins, respectively. In the event of the Executive's death prior to retirement, the Executive's beneficiary will receive an alternative benefit equal to the annual retirement benefit for a period of ten years following the death of the Executive. Such SERP benefits shall be vested upon a change of       control of the Company or the Bank or upon the Executive's termination of employment as a result of disability prior to December 31, 2019.
Potential           Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.  As described below, certain of the NEOs are parties to various agreements that provide       for payments in connection with any termination of their employment.

The employment agreement contains a provision stating that if Mr. Pantilione's employment is terminated in connection with any change in control, he will be paid a lump sum amount equal to 3.0 times his       annual base salary plus an amount equal to 3.0 times the average of the three highest annual bonuses awarded to him prior to such termination; provided that such severance payments following a change in control will be reduced so that such payments       will not be made in excess of the tax deductible amounts under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The employment agreement also contains an agreement not to compete with the Bank which restricts certain       post-employment activities of the employee within the Counties of Gloucester, Camden, Salem or Cumberland, New Jersey, for two years following termination of employment with the Bank.
Change         in Control Severance Agreements. The Company has implemented a Management Change in Control Agreement with John F.

Tax Fees. There were no tax related fees paid in 2018 or 2017.

The Audit Committee has not established pre-approval procedures and instead specifically approves each       service prior to the engagement of the auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It is the Audit Committee's policy to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services prior to the engagement of the Company's independent auditor to perform any       service.

There were no services that were not recognized to be non-audit services at the time       of engagement that were approved after the fact.
Ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor requires the affirmative vote of a majority       of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, by the shareholders of the Company at the Annual Meeting.
