TABLE OF CONTENTS
ABOUT THE MEETING 
Why did you send me this proxy statement?
We sent this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card to you because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This proxy statement summarizes information concerning the matters to be presented at the meeting and related information that will help you make an informed vote at the meeting. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are first being mailed to shareholders on or about December 20, 2018.
When is the annual meeting?
The annual meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., EST, at The Crowne Plaza, 2349 West Marlton Pike (Route 70), Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
What am I voting on?
At the annual meeting, you will be voting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To elect one director for a five-year term;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● On an advisory vote on approval of the compensation of executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any other matter, if any, as may properly come before the meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
How do you recommend that I vote on these items?
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the director nominee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● APPROVE on the advisory vote approving executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote?
You may vote if you owned our common share(s) as of the close of business on December 11, 2018, the record date for the annual meeting. On the record date there were 18,773,280 shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Who pays expenses related to the proxy solicitation? 
The expenses of the proxy solicitation will be borne by J & J Snack Foods Corp. ("J & J" or the "Company"). In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited in person or by telephone by directors, officers or employees of J & J and its subsidiaries without additional compensation. J & J may engage the services of a proxy-soliciting firm. J & J is required to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by record holders of J & J common stock, no par value ("Common Stock"), who are brokers, dealers, banks or voting trustees, or their nominees, for mailing proxy material and annual shareholder reports to the beneficial owners of Common Stock they hold of record, upon request of such recordholders.
How many votes are needed to elect a director?
Pursuant to the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the "NJBCA"), the election of directors will be determined by a plurality vote and the one (1) nominee receiving the most "FOR" votes will be elected. Approval of any other proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.
What constitutes a quorum?
The holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding shares of Common Stock, present either in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting and at any postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. Pursuant to the NJBCA, abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
What is the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes?
Under the NJBCA, abstentions, or a withholding of authority, or broker non-votes, are not counted as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on any proposal at the Annual Meeting. Brokers who hold shares for the accounts of their clients may vote such shares either as directed by their clients or in their own discretion if permitted by the applicable stock exchange or other organization of which they are members. Members of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") are permitted to vote their clients' shares in their own discretion as to certain "routine" matters if the clients have not timely furnished voting instructions prior to the Annual Meeting. The election of directors is not considered a routine matter. When a broker votes a client's shares on some, but not all, of the proposals at a meeting, the omitted votes are referred to as "broker non-votes."
How do I vote my shares?
If you are a registered shareholder (that is, if your stock is registered in your name), you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person or vote by proxy. To vote by mail - mark, sign and date your proxy card and return such card in the postage-paid envelope J & J has provided you.
If you hold your shares in street name (that is, if you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other holder of record), you will receive a voting instruction form from your broker, bank or other holder of record. This form will explain which voting options are available to you. If you want to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain an additional proxy card from your broker, bank or other holder of record authorizing you to vote. You must bring this proxy card to the meeting.
J & J encourages you to vote your shares for matters to be covered at the Annual Meeting.
What if I do not specify how I want my shares voted?
If you submit a signed proxy card but do not indicate how you want your shares voted, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote your shares of Common Stock:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● "for" the election of the nominee for director;  
● "approve" the advisory vote approving executive compensation; and  
● with respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote the proxies in their discretion in accordance with their best judgment and in the manner they believe to be in the best interest of J & J.  
[END TABLE]
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?
Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● submitting a later-dated proxy by mail; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Your attendance alone will not revoke your proxy. You must also vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in street name, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to change your vote.
Can shareholders speak or ask questions at the Annual Meeting?
Yes. J & J encourages shareholders to ask questions or to voice their views. J & J also wishes to assure order and efficiency for all attending shareholders. Accordingly, the Chairman of the Annual Meeting will have sole authority to make any determinations on the conduct of the Annual Meeting, including time allotted for each shareholder inquiry or similar rules to maintain order. Such determination by the Chairman of the Annual Meeting will be final, conclusive and binding. Anyone who is disruptive or refuses to comply with such rules of order will be excused from the Annual Meeting.
Can I attend the Annual Meeting?
Shareholders are encouraged to personally attend the annual Meeting whether or not you utilize proxy voting. If your shares are registered in street name, your method of voting is described above.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate Governance Guidelines
J & J is a Company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In accordance with New Jersey law and J & J's By-laws, the Board of Directors has responsibility for overseeing the conduct of J & J's business. J & J has established a Code of Business, Conduct and Ethics which is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Chief Executive and Senior Financial Officers. Copies of these codes are available on the Company's website.
Director Independence
The rules of NASDAQ require that a majority of the Company's Board of Directors and the Members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and the Nominating/ Governance Committee meet its independence criteria. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances of which it is aware in making an independence determination.
Based on the NASDAQ guidelines the Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent: Sidney R. Brown, Vincent Melchiorre and Peter G. Stanley. Neither Mr. Stanley nor Mr. Melchiorre has a business, financial, family or other type of relationship with J & J. Mr. Brown's company, NFI Industries, provided transportation services to the Company totaling none in 2016 and approximately $167,000 in fiscal 2017 and $180,000 in fiscal 2018.
Board Meetings
During the fiscal year the Board of Directors held four regularly scheduled meetings. Each Director attended at least 75% of the total meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committees on which he served.
Annual Meeting Attendance
It has been longstanding practice of the Company for all Directors to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All Directors attended the Annual Meeting held in February 2018.
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors
The Independent Directors meet in executive sessions without management present before or after regularly scheduled Board meetings. In addition, the Independent Directors meet at least once annually with the Chief Executive Officer at which time succession issues are discussed. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board has established stock ownership guidelines for the non-employee directors. Within two years of election as a director, the director must attain and hold 3000 shares of J & J's Common Stock. All current non-employee directors meet this guideline.
Board Leadership
The Board has reviewed and discussed the leadership structure. Mr. Shreiber serves as both principal executive officer and chairman of the board. Mr. Shreiber is the founder of the Company and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman since its inception. He currently beneficially owns 20% of the Company's stock and may be deemed to be its controlling shareholder. It is Mr. Shreiber's position, which is shared by the Board, that as controlling shareholder who is active in the business, as Mr. Shreiber has been for over the last 47 years, he should hold both roles.
Board Committees
In order to fulfill its responsibilities, the Board has delegated certain authority to its committees. There are three standing committees: (i) Audit Committee, (ii) Compensation Committee and (iii) Nominating/Governance Committee. Each Committee has its own Charter which is reviewed annually by each committee to assure ongoing compliance with applicable law and sound governance practices. Committee charters may be found on our website at www.jjsnack.com under the "Investor Relations" tab and then under "Corporate Governance". Paper copies are available at no cost by written request to Marjorie S. Roshkoff, Corporate Secretary, J & J Snack Foods Corp., 6000 Central Highway, Pennsauken, New Jersey 08109.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of directors Mr. Stanley (Chairman), Mr. Brown and Mr. Melchiorre, each of whom qualifies as an independent director and meets the other requirements to serve on the Audit Committee under rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.

The Audit Committee convened six (6) times during the 2018 fiscal year.
The Audit Committee currently does not have an Audit Committee Financial Expert, as such term is defined in Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Audit Committee believes that the background and experience of its members allow them to perform their duties as members of the Audit Committee. This background and experience include a former banker and current investment banker who regularly reviews financial statements of companies, a Chief Executive Officer of a substantial private company with financial oversight responsibilities who also is a former Chairman of the Board of a National Bank, and a businessman who has had substantial financial oversight responsibilities with food companies.

To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations received by it from such directors and executive officers, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the Company's officers, directors and greater than ten-percent beneficial owners were complied with during fiscal 2018.
The Role of the Board in Risk Oversight

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Introduction: J & J Snack Foods Corp. manufactures snack foods and frozen beverages which it markets nationally to the food service and retail supermarket industries. Our compensation programs are designed to support our business goals and promote both short-term and long-term growth. This section of the proxy statement explains how our compensation programs are designed and operate in practice with respect to our Named Executive officers. Our Named Executive Officers are the CEO, CFO and three most highly compensated executive officers in a particular year. The "Executive Compensation" section presents compensation earned by the Named Executive Officers.
Executive Compensation Objectives
Our executive compensation programs reflect our results-oriented corporate culture that rewards achievement of aggressive goals. Our compensation program for executive officers is designed to attract, retain, motivate and reward talented executives who will advance our strategic, operational and financial objectives and thereby enhance stockholder value.
The following principles are considered in setting compensation programs and pay levels:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation and benefit programs offered by J & J should appropriately reflect the size and financial resources of our Company in order to maintain long-term viability. These programs should be increasingly market-based (rather than legacy) and competitive, without limiting our ability to adequately invest in our business. This approach supports our efforts to maintain a viable and sustainable enterprise for the future.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation should reward Company and individual performance. Our programs should strive to deliver competitive compensation for exceptional individual and Company performance to companies with whom we compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee reviews reports of compensation of 100 local Philadelphia companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation of executive officers should be predominately performance-based. At higher levels in the Company, a greater proportion of an executive's compensation should be linked to Company performance and stockholder returns. As discussed below, our performance is measured against financial and operational goals and objectives. We also place emphasis on relative performance with our competitor peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The objectives of rewarding performance and retention should be balanced. In periods of temporary downturns in Company performance, particularly when driven by unanticipated industry events or customer decisions, our compensation programs should continue to ensure that high-achieving, marketable executives remain motivated and committed to J & J. This principle is essential to our effort to encourage our leaders to remain with J & J for long and productive careers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Executive officers should be J & J stockholders. Stock ownership aligns our executive officers' interest with those of our stockholders. They should be required to maintain ownership of J & J stock at a level appropriate for their position in the company. J & J's long-term equity-based compensation program should facilitate stock ownership and link a portion of compensation to stock price appreciation.  
[END TABLE]
Determining Compensation
The Compensation Committee's process for determining compensation levels for executive officers differs depending upon the compensation element and the position of the individual being considered. For each executive officer other than the CEO; the Compensation Committee annually reviews each element of compensation described below in consultation with the CEO. A number of factors are considered in determining individual compensation level, including performance of the individual and the business unit or function under his or her leadership, the Company's performance, and economic and business conditions affecting J & J at the time of the review. Management and external sources provide relevant information and analyses as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. Competitive market data (compensation of 100 local Philadelphia Companies) is considered from time to time, but we need not set compensation levels at a targeted percentile or rely solely on such data to make compensation decisions. While substantially guided by the applicable performance metrics of our programs, the Compensation Committee retains authority to exercise its judgment when approving individual awards. The Committee does not engage in the benchmarking of total compensation or any material component thereof.
With respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee meets to assess annual Company and individual performance. The Compensation Committee determines Mr. Shreiber's base salary based on the factors the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, considers relevant and in the best interest of J & J. Mr. Shreiber's bonus was determined by a formula approved by J & J's stockholders. The Compensation Committee granted Mr. Shreiber the stock options in accordance with a formula set forth in the Stock Option Plan approved by the stockholders
J & J's policies are generally not to have employment contracts or change in control provisions for its executive officers. Its five named executive officers have an average of over 36 years' service with the Company. None of these officers have employment contracts or change-in-control provisions. This substantial long-term commitment is also demonstrated in this group's significant ownership of Company stock.
Annual Cash Incentive 
The Annual Cash Incentive or Bonus for each Named Executive Officer is handled in a variety of ways. Certain executives are governed by various formula described below which have been developed over the years. The Compensation Committee reviews the formula annually and has determined that it is producing results that it considers fair and appropriate.
Gerald B. Shreiber - CEO. At our 2004 Annual Meeting, the Shareholders approved a bonus formula for Mr. Shreiber whereby he receives annually a bonus equal to 2.5 percent of the Company's Net Earnings. This formula produced a bonus of $1,899,387 in fiscal year 2016 and $1,979,342 in fiscal year 2017. The Committee did not follow this formula for 2018. Mr. Shreiber's bonus for fiscal year 2018 of $1,998,356 was determined independently of the formula because of the large tax benefit  the Company received in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This resulted in Mr. Shreiber receiving a lesser bonus than he would have had the Company followed the pre-approved formula.
Dennis G. Moore's, Senior Vice President and CFO, bonus is not determined by formula. In determining his bonus, the Compensation Committee periodically reviews the pay for Chief Financial Officers included in the Philadelphia Business Journal report on the 100 largest public companies in the region. The Committee did not use this information to create any specific comparison groups or as a benchmarking tool when determining any specific individual's compensation, including Mr. Moore. The Committee also considers the recommendation of the CEO and the annual results of the Company.
Robert Radano's, Senior Vice President and COO, has a target bonus of 50% to 70% of his base compensation. His bonus is subjective and based upon his performance. The committee also considers the recommendation of the CEO.
Daniel Fachner's annual bonus is equal to two percent (2%) of the earnings before taxes and foreign currency adjustments for the ICEE Company.
Gerard Law's annual bonus is subjective and based upon his performance of the varying duties to which he is assigned from time to time.
Long-Term Incentives
Long-term incentive compensation is designed to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align executive officer and stockholder interests;  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's decision to limit the use of long-term compensation to the stock options described below is because the Named Executive Officers have already accumulated substantial stock ownership over their long periods of service. As a result, compensation of the Named Executive Officers is primarily current compensation. The Compensation Committee did not consider any other forms of long-term incentives since its opinion is that the stock option grants are sufficient long-term incentives.
The terms of the long-term incentive awards granted to Named Executive Officers are described in the narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards table. In accordance with the Stock Option Plan, Mr. Shreiber's options are granted at the end of the Company's fiscal year. With the exception of options granted to recently hired employees at time of hire or to employees hired in connection with an acquisition, stock options have usually been granted annually. On March 13, 2018 the Board issued options to various employees at that date's closing price.
Benefits
Our Named Executive Officers participate in the full range of benefit and retirement plans provided to all salaried employees. These include health and welfare benefits, our 401(K) plan and our Stock Purchase Plan.
Perquisites
J & J provides a limited number of perquisites, to its Named Executive Officers. The most significant of these perquisites is the use of a Company automobile. Mr. Fachner is provided with an allowance to defray the cost of his Country Club membership.
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 compensation over $1 million to our executives is no longer deductible. Previously, compensation to Mr. Shreiber over $1 million was deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code as his bonus formula was approved as performance based compensation by shareholders in 2004. For fiscal year 2018, Mr. Shreiber's bonus was determined independently of the formula because of the large tax benefit the Company received in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This resulted in Mr. Shreiber receiving a lesser bonus than he would have had the Company followed the approved formula.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is based on the grant date fair value.
CEO Pay Ratio
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the Company is required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to its median paid employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to the Company's CEO.
Measurement Date
We identified the median employee using our employee population on June 2018 and total year-to-date compensation for all employees, excluding the Company's CEO.
Policy on Claw Backs 
The Company does not have any policy providing for the recovery of awards or payments if the relevant performance measures upon which they are based are restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of an award or payment. However, the Company is reviewing adopting such a policy. The SEC has proposed a rule on claw backs, which has not been finalized. This proposed rule requires final action by NASDAQ. Once NASDAQ has adopted final regulations, the Company plans to adopt a policy to comply.
Report of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
The Compensation Committee is required to approve the compensation payable to officers and directors and to family members of officers and directors. The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all officers, directors and employees of the Company. This code requires that if any director or executive officer or their family members or friends seek to provide goods or services to the Company or has or will have any transaction that is expected to exceed $120,000, they must notify the Company's Chief Financial Officer, who reviews the proposed transaction and notifies the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for review and action as it sees fit.
The Charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides that the Committee shall review the material terms of the transaction including the approximate dollar amount, and the material facts and the related persons direct or indirect interest in, or relationship to, the transaction. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, the Committee is directed to consider, among other factors it may deem appropriate, whether the transaction was or will be on terms no less favorable that those generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances. No director may participate in the discussion or approval of a transaction in which he or she, or a member of his or her immediate family, has a direct or indirect interest.
The Committee's Charter provides that it is deemed to have approved any transaction, even if exceeding $120,000, in which a related person's only interest is as a holder of the Company's stock, and all holders received or will receive proportional benefits (such as the payment of regular quarterly dividends).
The directors and executive officers annually complete a proxy questionnaire in which they are asked to describe any transactions they or their immediate family have with the company in an amount that exceeds $120,000.
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
Robyn Shreiber, daughter of Gerald B. Shreiber, is Vice President, National Account Sales of J & J Snack Foods Sales Corp., a subsidiary of J & J. During fiscal 2018 she received $270,608 in total compensation. Frank Shreiber, brother of Gerald B. Shreiber, is Director of Purchasing. During fiscal 2018, he received $ 179,721 in total compensation. Marjorie Shreiber Roshkoff, daughter of Gerald B. Shreiber, is Vice President, In-House Counsel of J & J Snack Foods Corp. During fiscal 2018, she received $171,856 in total compensation.
POTENTIAL PAYMENT UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The Company does not have any Agreements to provide payment or benefits to any Named Executive Officer upon termination or change-in-control.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to oversee the Company's accounting and financial reporting process and the audits of the Company's financial statements, as further detailed in the Committee's Charter.
The Company's management is responsible for the integrity of the Company's financial statements, as well as its accounting and financial reporting process and internal controls for compliance with applicable accounting standards, laws and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton"), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and expressing an opinion in its report on those financial statements.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing these processes, as well as the independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee does not conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. The Audit Committee has relied on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and in conformity with generally accepted accounting procedures in the U.S. and on the registered public accounting firm representations included in its report on the Company's financial statements. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also audited and discussed with the Audit Committee the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018. The Committee discussed with the Company's registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton, the matters required to be discussed by the Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards 61, Communication with Audit Committees (as modified or supplemented). In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with Grant Thornton its independence from the Company and considered whether the providing of non-audit services to the Company by Grant Thornton is compatible with maintaining Grant Thornton's independence.
Based on these reviews and discussions and in reliance thereon, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.

Audit Committee Policies and Procedures on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services 
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures requiring that the Company obtain the Committee's pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by Grant Thornton as the Company's independent accountants. Pre-approval is generally granted on a fiscal year basis, is detailed as to the particular service or category of services to be provided and is granted after consideration of the estimated fees for each service or category of service. Actual fees and any changes to estimated fees for preapproved services are reported to the Committee on a quarterly basis.
Other Matters
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered whether the provision of tax services described above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the Company's principal accountant. The Audit Committee has approved Grant Thornton's performing these services.
PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON APPROVAL OF  THE COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVES
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandates that as part of their annual proxy vote companies conduct a separate vote to approve the compensation of executives named in the Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Table. Information about the Company's current compensation of its executive officers is contained in the sections of this proxy entitled Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Executive Compensation Summary Compensation Table. According to the Dodd-Frank Act, this vote by the shareholders on approval of executive compensation is non-binding on the Company's Board of Directors. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Company's shareholders, in advisory votes, approved the 2018 compensation of executives and voted that this approval be held on a yearly basis. Based on this vote, the Board of Directors decided to submit to the shareholders on a yearly basis, the advisory vote on the compensation of Executives.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote APPROVE on the following advisory (non-binding) shareholder resolution approving executive compensation.
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED."
OTHER MATTERS

The enclosed proxy confers discretionary authority to vote with respect to any and all of the following matters that may come before the Meeting: (i) matters which the Company does not know, a reasonable time before the proxy solicitation, are to be presented at the Meeting; (ii) approval of the minutes of a prior meeting of shareholders, if such approval does not amount to ratification of the action taken at the meeting; (iii) the election of any person to any office for which a bona fide nominee named in this Proxy Statement is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve; (iv) any proposal omitted from this Proxy Statement and the form of proxy pursuant to Rules l4a 8 or l4a 9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (v) matters incident to the conduct of the Meeting. In conjunction with such matters, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote in accordance with their best judgment.
