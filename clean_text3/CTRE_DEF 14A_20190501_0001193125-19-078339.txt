Proxy Statement 
For the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on May 1, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") of CareTrust REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, for use at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held at the Company's offices located at 905 Calle Amanecer, Suite 300, San Clemente, California 92673, at 9:00 a.m. PDT, on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"). On or about March 21, 2019, proxy materials for the Annual Meeting, including this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 ("Annual Report"), are being made available to stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
When used in this Proxy Statement, the terms "we," "us," "our," "CareTrust REIT," or the "Company" refer to CareTrust REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS 
This Proxy Statement and our Annual Report are available on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. These materials are also available in the "Investor" section of our website at www.caretrustreit.com. The other information on our website does not constitute part of this Proxy Statement. 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Notice of Internet Availability 
In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have elected to furnish our proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement and our Annual Report, to stockholders on the Internet. Accordingly, we are mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability") to our stockholders that did not request to receive paper copies of our proxy materials and Annual Report or are otherwise receiving our proxy materials electronically by email. The Notice of Internet Availability contains instructions on how stockholders can access those documents over the Internet and vote their shares. All stockholders who do not receive a Notice of Internet Availability, or who have not consented to receive their proxy materials electronically by e-mail, will receive a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail. 
Items of Business to be Voted on at the Annual Meeting 
At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders of the Company will be asked to vote on the following three proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To elect Mr. Allen C. Barbieri, Mr. Jon D. Kline and Ms. Diana M. Laing to the  Board of Directors to serve until the Company's 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal 1).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (Proposal 2).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's  independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal 3).  
[END TABLE]
We will also consider other business that properly comes before the Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors recommends you vote FOR the election of each of Mr. Barbieri, Mr. Kline and Ms. Laing to the Board of Directors, FOR the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, and FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Available Voting Methods 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you should vote your shares by using one of the methods described below to ensure your shares will be counted. 
Stockholder of record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., you are considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares and the proxy materials were made available directly to you by the Company. As a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, or by submitting a proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability. If you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, you can also submit a proxy by mail or telephone pursuant to the instructions provided in the proxy card enclosed with the proxy materials. 
Beneficial stockholder. Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee (that is, in "street name") rather than directly in their own name. If your shares are held in street name, you are considered the "beneficial stockholder" of such shares and the proxy materials were made available to you by the organization holding your shares. As a beneficial stockholder, you may submit your voting instructions over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability, or, if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, you can also submit voting instructions by telephone or mail by following the instructions provided in the voting instruction form sent by your broker, bank or other nominee. If you are a beneficial stockholder, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 
If you receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability or set of proxy materials, it means your shares are registered differently (for instance, under different names) or are held in more than one account. Please follow the voting instructions on each Notice of Internet Availability, proxy card or voting instruction form you receive. 
Record Date and Quorum Requirements 
Our Board of Directors has fixed March 5, 2019 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 88,941,205 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), were issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote, and all shares of Common Stock will vote as a single class with respect to all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. 
To constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at the Annual Meeting, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. 
Deadline for Voting Your Shares 
If you are a stockholder of record, your proxy must be received by telephone or the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 30, 2019 in order for your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting. However, if you are a   stockholder of record and you received a copy of the proxy materials by mail, you may instead mark, sign and date the proxy card you received and return it in the accompanying prepaid and addressed envelope so that it is received by the Company before the Annual Meeting in order for your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in street name, please provide your voting instructions by the deadline specified by the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares. 
Changing Your Vote or Revoking a Previously Submitted Proxy 
If you are a stockholder of record, you have the power to change or revoke a previously submitted proxy at any time before it is exercised by: delivering to the Secretary of the Company, before the polls close at the Annual Meeting, an instrument revoking such proxy; properly submitting a proxy on a later date via Internet or by telephone or mail; or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself constitute revocation of a proxy. For shares held in street name, you may revoke any previous voting instructions by submitting new voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares by the deadline for voting specified in the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. Alternatively, if your shares are held in street name and you have obtained a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting, you may revoke any previous voting instructions by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
Required Vote 
Election of Directors (Proposal 1): In March 2019, we amended and restated our Amended and Restated Bylaws (as so amended and restated, the "Bylaws") to provide for majority voting in the election of directors. As a result, each director nominee will be elected at the Annual Meeting if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election (that is, the number of votes cast FOR the nominee must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST the nominee). The majority voting standard does not apply, however, in a contested election where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at an annual meeting of stockholders. In such circumstances, directors will instead be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast in the election of directors at the annual meeting at which a quorum is present. The election of directors at the Annual Meeting is not contested. 
Under Maryland law, if an incumbent director is not re-elected at a meeting of stockholders at which he or she stands for re-election, then the incumbent director continues to serve in office as a holdover director until his or her successor is elected. To address this "holdover" issue, our Bylaws provide that if an incumbent director is not re-elected due to his or her failure to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, the director will promptly tender his or her resignation as a director, subject to acceptance by the Board. The nominating and corporate governance committee will then make a recommendation to our Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. Our Board will act on the nominating and corporate governance committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision, along with its rationale, within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results. 
Other Items (Proposals 2 and 3): Once a quorum has been established, pursuant to our Bylaws, approval of each of the other items to be submitted for a vote of the stockholders at the Annual Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. Notwithstanding this vote standard required by our Bylaws, Proposal 2 (advisory approval of named executive officer compensation) and Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm) are only advisory votes and are not binding on us. Our Board of Directors will consider the outcome of the vote on both of these proposals in considering what action, if any, should be taken in response to the advisory vote by stockholders.  How Votes Are Counted at the Annual Meeting 
For Proposal 1 (election of directors), Proposal 2 (advisory approval of named executive officer compensation) and Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm), you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. 
For each proposal, shares voted ABSTAIN will not be counted as a vote cast on such proposal and therefore will not be counted in determining the outcome of the proposal. 
If you hold your shares in street name through a brokerage account and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may generally vote your shares in its discretion on routine matters. However, a broker cannot vote shares held in street name on non-routine matters unless the broker receives voting instructions from the stockholder. Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter, while each of Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 2 (advisory approval of named executive officer compensation) is considered a non-routine matter. Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may exercise its discretion to vote your shares on Proposal 3, but will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of the other items at the Annual Meeting. If your broker exercises this discretion, your shares will be voted on Proposal 3 in the manner directed by your broker, but your shares will constitute "broker non-votes" for each of Proposals 1 and 2. A broker non-vote will not be counted in determining the outcome of Proposals 1 and 2 because it will not be considered a vote cast on those proposals. 
If you properly submit a proxy or voting instructions but do not indicate your specific voting instructions on one or more of the items listed above in the Notice of Annual Meeting, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors on those items. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The expenses of preparing, assembling, printing and mailing the Notice of Internet Availability, this Proxy Statement and the materials used in the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. Proxies will be solicited through the Internet and the mail and may be solicited by our officers, directors and employees in person or by telephone or email. Our officers, directors and employees will not receive additional compensation for any such solicitation efforts. We do not anticipate paying any compensation to any other party for the solicitation of proxies but may reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners. We may retain the services of a proxy solicitation firm if, in the Board's view, it is deemed necessary or advisable. Although we do not currently expect to retain such a firm, we estimate that the fees of any such firm retained by us could be up to $50,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses, all of which would be paid by us.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of five directors. At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting"), the Board of Directors recommended, and stockholders approved, amendments to our Articles of Amendment and Restatement (as so amended, the "Charter") to declassify the Board of Directors and to phase in the annual election of directors beginning at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Accordingly, beginning at our 2018 Annual Meeting, directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting at which they are to be elected will stand for election for a one-year term and will hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. 
The current terms of our Class II directors and of Allen C. Barbieri, who was elected to our Board of Directors for a one-year term at the 2018 Annual Meeting, expire at this Annual Meeting. On the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board of Directors, our Board of Directors selected Mr. Allen C. Barbieri, Mr. Jon D. Kline and Ms. Diana M. Laing as its nominees for election to our Board at the Annual Meeting. Ms. Laing was appointed to our Board of Directors on January 15, 2019 and was initially identified as a potential director candidate by multiple persons, including a member of our management and a member of our Board of Directors. 
Messrs. Barbieri and Kline and Ms. Laing have each consented to being named in the Proxy Statement and to serve as a director if elected. We have no reason to believe that either Mr. Barbieri, Mr. Kline or Ms. Laing will be unable or unwilling for good cause to serve if elected. In the event Mr. Barbieri, Mr. Kline or Ms. Laing is unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons who are designated as proxy holders may exercise discretionary authority to vote for a substitute nominee selected by our Board of Directors or our Board of Directors may reduce the number of directors on the Board. 
Directors and Director Nominee 
Set forth below is biographical information about Mr. Barbieri, Mr. Kline and Ms. Laing as well as our continuing directors. Such information is current as of the date of this Proxy Statement. The information presented below for each director includes the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led us to the conclusion that such director should be nominated to serve on our Board of Directors in light of our business.

("Ensign"), where he was instrumental in assembling the real estate portfolio that became CareTrust REIT's initial asset base at the time CareTrust REIT became an independent company in 2014. A co-founder of Ensign, he also served as Ensign's Vice President, General Counsel and Assistant Secretary beginning shortly after Ensign's founding in 1999. Mr. Stapley previously served as General Counsel for the Sedgwick Companies, an Orange County-based manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer with 192 retail outlets across the United States. Prior to that, Mr. Stapley was an equity member of the Phoenix law firm of Jennings, Strouss & Salmon PLC, where his practice emphasized real estate transactions and government relations. Having served as CareTrust REIT's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2014, as Ensign's Executive Vice President from 2009 to 2014 and as Vice President and General Counsel of Ensign from 1999 to 2009, Mr. Stapley brings to the Board extensive management experience, critical knowledge of our properties and key tenants, substantial industry contacts and knowledge and understanding of the healthcare business in general. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the election of each of the director nominees listed above. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them FOR each such director nominee.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Independence 
Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that none of Allen C. Barbieri, Jon D. Kline, Diana M. Laing or Spencer G. Plumb has a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director and that each such director is an independent director under the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq"). In this Proxy Statement, the aforementioned directors are referred to individually as an "Independent Director" and collectively as the "Independent Directors." The Board of Directors also previously determined that David G. Lindahl, during his service on our Board of Directors until his resignation effective November 29, 2018, was an independent director under applicable Nasdaq rules. Mr. Stapley does not qualify as an independent director because he is employed as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, as the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to make that determination based upon the position and direction of the Company and the membership of the Board. The Board has determined that having the Company's current Chief Executive Officer serve as Chairman makes the best use of the Chief Executive Officer's extensive knowledge of the Company and its industry, as well as fostering greater communication between the Company's management and the Board. The Company has not currently designated a lead independent director. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company's management of risk. The Board strives to effectively oversee the Company's enterprise-wide risk management in a way that balances managing risks while enhancing the long-term value of the Company for the benefit of the stockholders. The Board of Directors understands that its focus on effective risk oversight is critical to setting the Company's tone and culture towards effective risk management. To administer its oversight function, the Board seeks to understand the Company's risk philosophy by having discussions with management to establish a mutual understanding of the Company's overall appetite for risk. Our Board of Directors maintains an active dialogue with management about existing risk management processes and how management identifies, assesses and manages the Company's most significant risk exposures. Our Board expects frequent updates from management about the Company's most significant risks so as to enable it to evaluate whether management is responding appropriately. 
Our Board relies on each of its committees to help oversee the risk management responsibilities relating to the functions performed by such committees. Our audit committee periodically discusses with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies. Our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees risks relating to the Company's corporate compliance programs and assists the Board and management in promoting an organizational culture that encourages commitment to ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law. Each of these committees is required to make regular reports of its actions and any recommendations to the Board, including recommendations to assist the Board with its overall risk oversight function. 
Our Board of Directors believes that the processes it has established to administer the Board's risk oversight function would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not have a material effect on our leadership structure described under "– Board Leadership Structure" above. 
Compensation Risk Assessment. The compensation committee identifies and considers risks related to our executive compensation, including during its review and approval of our executive compensation program. Our   compensation programs are designed to reward our named executive officers and other employees for the achievement of the Company's corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation of long-term value for stockholders, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. The compensation committee has concluded that the current executive compensation program does not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking. In making its determination, the compensation committee noted that each named executive officer's direct compensation under our executive compensation program consists primarily of a fixed base salary, an annual incentive bonus opportunity and long-term equity incentive awards. Annual incentive bonuses are balanced with long-term equity incentives, which are generally subject to a multi-year vesting schedule. 
Meetings and Attendance 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Board of Directors held five meetings. Each member of the Board during 2018 attended at least 75 percent of the aggregate of all meetings of our Board and meetings of any of our Board committees on which he served during the period that he served in fiscal 2018. In addition, the Independent Directors meet in executive sessions at which only Independent Directors are present in conjunction with each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. 
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our Board of Directors at our annual meeting of stockholders, we encourage our directors to attend. All incumbent directors who served at the time of the 2018 Annual Meeting attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors has an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Each such committee has a written charter, a copy of which is posted on our web site at www.caretrustreit.com under the Investors — Corporate Governance section. The Board of Directors and each of its committees may meet, at times, without management present. The following table presents the composition of the committees of our Board of Directors as of the date of this Proxy Statement and the number of meetings held by each committee in 2018:

The compensation committee may delegate any or all of its responsibilities to a subcommittee consisting of at least two members to the extent consistent with the Company's Charter and Bylaws, applicable law and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The compensation committee has no current intention to delegate any of its other responsibilities to a subcommittee. The compensation committee may confer with the Board in determining the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. In determining compensation for executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the compensation committee considers, among other things, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. 
Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee is authorized to retain or obtain the advice of compensation consultants, outside counsel, experts or other advisors to advise the compensation committee with respect to amounts or forms of executive and director compensation or in carrying out its other responsibilities. For fiscal 2016, the compensation committee retained Christenson Advisory Services ("Christenson") as its compensation consultant to perform the compensation-related services described below in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The compensation committee retained Christenson again in 2019. 
Audit Committee. Our audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Barbieri and Kline and Ms. Laing. Mr. Kline serves as chairman of the audit committee. All members of the audit committee meet the independence requirements set forth by the SEC and the Nasdaq listing standards. Each member of our audit committee is financially literate in accordance with the Nasdaq listing standards. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Kline and Barbieri and Ms. Laing qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the rules and regulations established by the SEC. This designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to the experience and understanding of each of Messrs. Kline and Barbieri and Ms. Laing with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose on Messrs. Kline or Barbieri or Ms. Laing any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than those generally imposed as a member of our audit committee and our Board of Directors, and such designation as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of our audit committee or Board of Directors.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committee currently consists of Messrs. Barbieri, Kline and Plumb.

[END TABLE]
The Company's Director Nomination Process 
As indicated above, our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees the director nomination process. This committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in establishing minimum qualifications for director nominees, including the qualities and skills that members of our Board of Directors are expected to possess. Under our nominating and corporate governance committee charter, which is available at our website at www.caretrustreit.com, these criteria include the candidate's knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity. Our nominating and corporate governance committee identifies and evaluates individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors. Our nominating and corporate governance committee then recommends that our Board of Directors select the director nominees for the election at the next annual meeting of stockholders, or to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors occurring between annual meetings of our stockholders. 
Although we do not have a formal diversity policy, we believe it is important to have an appropriate mix of diversity for the optimal functionality of the Board of Directors. Our nominating and corporate governance committee charter requires that the nominating and corporate governance committee consider each candidate's background and qualifications, including knowledge, diversity, ability, judgment, skills and experience, in the context of the needs and current make-up of the Board of Directors when evaluating director nominees. The   Board of Directors believes it is important for each member of the Board of Directors to possess skills and knowledge in the areas of leadership of large, complex organizations, finance, strategic planning, legal, government relations and relevant industries, especially the healthcare and real estate industries. These considerations help the Board of Directors as a whole to have the appropriate mix of skills and experiences for the optimal functioning of the Board of Directors in its oversight of our Company. As part of its periodic self-assessment process, the nominating and corporate governance committee annually reviews and evaluates its performance, including overall composition of the Board of Directors and the criteria that it uses for selecting nominees in light of the specific skills and characteristics necessary for the optimal functioning of the Board of Directors in its oversight of our Company. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee will consider candidates for election or appointment to the Board recommended by stockholders. If a stockholder wishes to recommend a director candidate, he or she should submit such recommendation in writing to the Chair, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, care of the Secretary of the Company, together with information about the stockholder and the candidate otherwise required for director nominations by a stockholder pursuant to Section 11 of Article II of our Bylaws, a copy of which will be made available upon request. The nominating and corporate governance committee may request additional information concerning the director candidate as it deems reasonably required to determine the eligibility and qualification of the director candidate to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Stockholders recommending candidates for consideration by our Board of Directors in connection with the next annual meeting of stockholders should submit their written recommendation no later than January 1 of the year of that meeting. All recommendations will be brought to the attention of the nominating and corporate governance committee, and the nominating and corporate governance committee shall evaluate such director nominees in accordance with the same criteria applicable to the evaluation of all director nominees. 
Stockholders who wish to nominate a person for election as a director in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders (as opposed to making a recommendation to the nominating and corporate governance committee as described above) must deliver written notice to our Secretary in the manner described in Section 11 of Article II of our Bylaws and within the time periods set forth at the end of this Proxy Statement under the section "Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders." 
Communications with Directors 
Stockholders who would like to send communications to our Board may do so by submitting such communications to our Secretary at CareTrust REIT, Inc., 905 Calle Amanecer, Suite 300, San Clemente, California 92673. Stockholders may also communicate with our Board of Directors as a group using the form available on our website at www.caretrustreit.com under "Contact the Board" in the Investors – Corporate Governance section. We suggest, but do not require, that such submissions include the name and contact information of the stockholder making the submission and a description of the matter that is the subject of the communication. Communications are distributed to the Board, or to any individual directors as appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication. In that regard, our Board of Directors requests that certain items which are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board be excluded. The Secretary will not forward to the Board of Directors junk mail, job inquiries, business solicitations, offensive or otherwise inappropriate materials. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all employees, including employees of our subsidiaries, as well as each member of our Board of Directors. The code of business conduct and ethics is available at our website at www.caretrustreit.com under the Investors — Corporate Governance section. We intend to satisfy any disclosure required under applicable rules of the SEC or Nasdaq regarding an amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of this code of business conduct and ethics by posting such information on our website, at the address specified above.  Board and Director Evaluation Process 
Pursuant to the charter of the nominating and corporate governance committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee oversees an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, including each committee of the Board. The evaluation process is designed to assess the overall effectiveness of the Board and its committees and to identify opportunities for improving Board and Board committee operations and procedures. 
Succession Planning 
The compensation committee is responsible for reviewing the Company's succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer and working with appropriate members of management to review the Company's general management succession plans. In performing these functions, the Chief Executive Officer makes available to the compensation committee his recommendations and evaluations of potential successors, along with his review of any development plans recommended for such individuals.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of the Company's named executive officer compensation program and analyzes the compensation decisions made for our executive officers included in the Summary Compensation Table below (the "named executive officers"). 
2018 Named Executive Officers 
Our named executive officers for 2018 were: 
Gregory K. Stapley – Chief Executive Officer 
William M. Wagner – Chief Financial Officer 
David M. Sedgwick – Chief Operating Officer 
Mark D. Lamb – Chief Investment Officer 
Because only four individuals served as our executive officers at any time during 2018, we have only four named executive officers for 2018. 
Introduction 
We believe that 2018 was a successful year for the Company. Our named executive officers successfully executed our business plan during 2018 and built upon our operating and financial performance results achieved since we became a separate publicly traded company on June 1, 2014 following the separation of Ensign's healthcare business and its real estate business into two separate and independent publicly traded companies through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of CareTrust REIT to Ensign stockholders on a pro rata basis (the "Spin-Off"). Our operating and financial performance highlights achieved in 2018 included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Posting net income of $0.72, normalized FFO (as defined below) of $1.28 and normalized funds available for  distribution ("FAD") of $1.32 in 2018, compared to net income of $0.35, normalized FFO of $1.16 and normalized FAD of $1.22 in 2017, all per diluted weighted-average common share;1  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Raising $182.3 million gross proceeds under our At-The-Market Offering Program;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acquiring 12 properties (consisting of 10 skilled nursing facilities and 2 multi-service campuses), initiating  three new net-lease tenant relationships, and expanding one existing net-lease tenant relationship;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Investing approximately $112.0 million (inclusive of transaction costs) at a blended initial cash yield of  8.9%; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generating total stockholder return of approximately 15.9% (versus approximately 6.2% for the SNL US REIT  Healthcare Index) for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  See Appendix A for a reconciliation of normalized FFO and normalized FAD to net income computed in accordance  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Program Highlights 
Highlights of our executive compensation program include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation philosophy is to pay our named executive officers what we believe are below-market  base salaries, and to award performance-based annual cash incentive opportunities that factor in these lower base salary levels to provide a meaningful annual cash compensation opportunity for over-performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual equity and cash incentive bonuses are performance based and tied to the achievement of three performance  metrics that we believe are aligned with the Company's corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation of long-term value for our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Beginning with our executive compensation program for 2017, we modified our performance-based restricted stock  award program so that in addition to the annual performance requirement we have had in prior years, 50% of the number of restricted shares granted (based on prior year performance) were subject to additional performance-based vesting over a  four-year period and only vest if we achieve objective normalized FFO per share growth hurdles. We continued this performance-based restricted stock award program in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program 
Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, motivate and retain quality executive officers to ensure the success and growth of the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executive compensation with the Company's corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation  of long-term value for our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Connect short- and long-term incentive awards to performance metrics that we believe drive the performance of our  Common Stock over the long-term;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Utilize various performance metrics to minimize the potential for risk associated with over-weighting any  particular performance metric; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link our named executive officers' interests with our stockholders' interests by tying executive  compensation to our performance and increases in long-term stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Committee 
Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee has the authority to determine the amount of compensation given to each of the named executive officers. The compensation committee annually evaluates the performance of each of the named executive officers and determines compensation levels based on its performance evaluation. The compensation committee also, among other things, approves our executive compensation plans and policies, and is responsible for administering our equity incentive plan, with authority to approve award grants under the plan. In performing its duties, the compensation committee is authorized to consider the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer when determining the compensation of the other named executive officers. 
Each element of our executive compensation program was unanimously approved by the compensation committee. All compensation committee members are independent under applicable Nasdaq rules. None of our named executive officers is a member of our compensation committee or otherwise had any role in determining the compensation of our other named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations to the compensation committee as to the compensation of the other named executive officers. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
Pursuant to its charter, the compensation committee is authorized to retain or obtain the advice of compensation consultants, outside counsel, experts or other advisors to advise the compensation committee with respect to amounts or forms of executive compensation or in carrying out its other responsibilities. In 2016, the compensation committee retained Christenson as its independent compensation consultant. Christenson specializes in providing compensation advisory services to the global real estate industry. The compensation committee was directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of Christenson's work. The   compensation committee had previously assessed the independence of Christenson pursuant to applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules and concluded that no conflict of interest existed with respect to Christenson's services to the compensation committee. Christenson has not performed any services for us, except for compensation-related services on behalf of, and as instructed by, the compensation committee. 
Christenson's services during 2016 included providing advice with respect to the composition of our two peer groups described below and providing recommendations on appropriate base salary, target annual bonus and long-term incentive levels. Christenson did not perform any services for us during 2017 or 2018, as the compensation committee continued to rely on the work performed in 2016 to inform its compensation decisions in 2017 and 2018. The compensation committee has engaged Christenson to make recommendations regarding executive officer compensation for 2019. 
Peer Companies 
In connection with the comprehensive compensation survey performed by Christenson in 2016 and based on Christenson's recommendations, the compensation committee selected two separate peer groups in 2016, which it continued to use to inform its compensation decisions for 2017 and 2018. Our objective in selecting our first peer group was to include the group of other public real estate companies that we believe we most directly compete with for both business and executive talent. The compensation committee believes it is important to understand what our direct competitors are paying their executives, and uses this information as one of the data points it considers when determining the compensation levels for the named executive officers. We refer to this peer group as our "Direct Competitor Peers," and it includes the following nine companies: 
Direct Competitor Peers 
Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. 
Care Capital Properties, Inc. (prior to its acquisition in August 2017) 
Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated 
LTC Properties, Inc. 
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. 
National Health Investors, Inc. 
Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. 
Physicians Realty Trust 
Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.  Our objective in selecting our second peer group was to include a group of similarly-sized public real estate companies. In selecting this peer group, we performed a market capitalization screen of public real estate companies in December 2015 and selected companies having market capitalizations ranging from approximately $700 million to $2 billion. In paring down the group of public real estate companies satisfying our market capitalization criteria, we emphasized the inclusion of companies that we believe are either our competitors or who have similar characteristics to the Company. Our objective in selecting the companies in this peer group was to position the Company's market capitalization at approximately the 50th percentile level of the market capitalizations of the peer group of companies (as measured when the peer group was constructed in December 2015). We reviewed the current market capitalizations of the peer group of companies in March 2019 and believe this mixture of companies generally remains similar in size to the Company, as the peer group market capitalizations ranged from approximately $560 million to just under $5 billion (with all but three of the peer companies having market capitalizations in March 2019 below $2 billion). The compensation committee believes it is important to understand what similarly-sized public real estate companies are paying their executives, and uses this information as one of the data points it considers when determining the compensation levels for the named executive officers. We refer to this peer group as our "Compensation Peers," and it includes the following nine companies: 
Compensation Peers 
Agree Realty Corporation 
Chatham Lodging Trust 
Coresite Realty Corporation 
Getty Realty Corp. 
LTC Properties, Inc. 
Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation 
One Liberty Properties, Inc.

The purpose of our 2016 compensation survey was to provide the compensation committee with information on the compensation levels at the Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers. The compensation committee currently does not believe a comprehensive compensation survey needs to be performed on an annual basis. The compensation committee currently intends to engage an independent compensation consultant to perform a comprehensive survey either once every two or three years, or more frequently if it is considering any structural changes to our executive compensation program. Consistent with this intent, the compensation committee has engaged Christenson to update the compensation survey for 2019 and make recommendations regarding the compensation of our executive officers. 
The information in the 2016 compensation survey was used by the compensation committee to inform its decision-making process with respect to the 2018 compensation amounts for the named executive officers, particularly in connection with the compensation committee's decision to increase base salary levels for 2018 as described below. However, the compensation committee does not rigidly adhere to a peer-based benchmarking strategy in setting compensation amounts for our named executive officers, which is one of the reasons it believes that a comprehensive compensation survey does not need to be performed on an annual basis. Instead, the peer group compensation information is one of many data points considered by the compensation committee in making subjective compensation decisions using its business judgment. Other factors considered include, but are not limited to, our objective of attracting and retaining highly qualified executives and our emphasis on performance-based compensation that is described in more detail below. 
Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes 
At the Annual Meeting, we will be providing our stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is known as the "say-on-pay"  proposal. Stockholders have overwhelmingly voted in favor of our say-on-pay proposal since they first had an opportunity to do so at our 2017 annual meeting, with over 99% of the votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay proposal at our 2017 annual meeting and over 97% of the votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay proposal at our 2018 annual meeting. We believe the overwhelmingly positive support demonstrates that stockholders support the structure and objectives of our executive compensation program. For 2018, the compensation committee retained substantially the same executive compensation program that was in place during 2017. The compensation committee will consider the outcome of this year's say-on-pay proposal when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers. 
Material Elements of Compensation 
2018 Base Salaries 
We pay each named executive officer a fixed base salary to provide each executive with a minimum level of cash compensation. One aspect of our executive compensation philosophy is to pay base salary levels that we believe are below the base salary amounts generally paid by our Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers to their similarly-situated executives and, in contrast to our Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers, and as explained in more detail below, to provide our named executive officers with the opportunity to earn a comparatively larger annual performance-based cash bonus opportunity, so that a greater portion of the named executive officers' total annual cash opportunity is at risk and tied to performance metrics that we believe drive the performance of our Common Stock over the long-term. 
Decisions regarding adjustments to base salaries are made at the discretion of our compensation committee, after considering each executive's current base salary, job responsibilities, performance, the base salaries paid by our Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers to similarly situated executives and our base salary compensation philosophy described above. No named executive officers are entitled to any automatic base salary increases. 
The compensation committee reviewed each named executive officer's base salary in January 2018 and decided to increase the 2018 base salary of each named executive officer as follows: Mr. Stapley's base salary was increased from $495,000 to $545,000; Mr. Wagner's base salary was increased from $310,000 to $342,000; Mr. Sedgwick's base salary was increased from $285,000 to $315,000; and Mr. Lamb's base salary was also increased from $285,000 to $315,000. The compensation committee believes the increase to the base salary levels for the named executive officers was appropriate to reflect a reasonable cost-of-living increase as well as the Company's growth and increased size since the previous year. Based on our 2016 compensation survey, we continue to believe each named executive officer's 2018 base salary is below the base salaries paid by both the Direct Competitor Peers and the Compensation Peers to their similarly situated executives. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Awards 
In General. We provide our named executive officers with a performance-based annual cash incentive compensation opportunity to motivate and reward the executives for their achievement of annual financial and operational goals and other strategic objectives measured over the year. We believe the annual cash incentive opportunity helps further our compensation objective of aligning executive compensation with achievement of the Company's corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation of long-term value for our stockholders. 
Our executive compensation philosophy is to award our named executive officers performance-based annual cash incentive opportunities that compensate the executives for what we believe are below-market base salary levels. The compensation committee takes the named executive officers' base salary levels into account when it establishes each executive's potential cash incentive award payouts, with the intent that each executive's targeted annual cash opportunity (which is base salary plus target annual incentive payment) is competitive and that each executive has a meaningful upside annual cash compensation opportunity for over performance. We believe this compensation philosophy is consistent with our pay-for-performance culture and our compensation objective of linking pay to performance.  Design. Under our annual cash incentive plan design for 2018, the compensation committee selected the following performance measures to evaluate executive incentive performance:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  normalized funds from operation ("FFO" and once normalized "NFFO") per share for 2018;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  capital deployment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  average net debt to EBITDA calculated at each quarter end during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), is an important supplemental measure not computed in accordance with GAAP and measures operating performance for a REIT. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. NFFO adjusts FFO for certain revenue and expense items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating results, such as costs associated with the Spin-Off, written-off deferred financing fees, expensed acquisition costs and other unanticipated charges. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense (including amortization of deferred financing costs) and amortization of stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization. These performance measures are non-GAAP financial measures for which net income is the most directly comparable financial measure reported under GAAP. 
The compensation committee chose NFFO per share as a performance metric because the committee believes it is a common performance metric used by investors to evaluate the performance of REITs, and the committee believes that motivating the executives to drive growth in our NFFO per share performance will in turn benefit stockholders in the form of increased stockholder returns. The compensation committee determined the threshold, target and high performance levels for our 2018 NFFO per share by measuring them against our NFFO per share actually achieved for 2017, and then building in appropriate increases to incentivize the executives to continue to grow our NFFO per share. The compensation committee determined a target level for our 2018 NFFO per share performance that represented an approximate 10.3% increase over our NFFO per share actually achieved for 2017. In addition, in order to achieve the threshold NFFO per share performance for 2018, we were required to achieve an increase of 6.9% in our NFFO per share actually achieved for 2017, and the maximum performance level for the NFFO per share performance metric could be achieved only if our 2018 NFFO per share exceeded our 2017 NFFO per share results by approximately 13.8%. The compensation committee believed the target NFFO per share level would require the named executive officers to successfully execute our business plan during 2018, while it believed the maximum bonus opportunity for the NFFO per share performance metric was a stretch goal that was meant to be difficult to attain. 
The compensation committee chose our capital deployment and our 2018 average quarterly net debt to EBITDA ratio as performance metrics because it wanted to motivate the executives to grow our portfolio and pursue new tenant relationships with quality operators to further diversify our revenue from sources other than Ensign, while at the same time motivating the executives to responsibly manage our leverage ratios and our overall capital structure. 
We required a 2018 NFFO per share amount of $1.24 to earn the threshold bonus amount, $1.28 to earn the target bonus amount, and $1.32 to earn the high bonus amount payable with respect to this performance measure (representing an increase of 6.9%, 10.3% and 13.8%, respectively, over our NFFO achieved for 2017, as further described above). We required capital deployment during 2018 of $100 million to earn the threshold bonus amount, $175 million to earn the target bonus amount, and $250 million to earn the high bonus amount payable with respect to this performance measure. We required a 2018 average quarterly ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be 5.0x to earn the threshold bonus amount, 4.7x to earn the target bonus amount, and 4.4x to earn the high bonus amount payable with respect to this performance measure. The capital deployment targets were held constant compared to 2017, while the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio targets were tightened (i.e., made more difficult to achieve relative to the 2017 targets) to more closely align with the Company's leverage objectives. As noted above, we believe these capital deployment and ratio of net debt to EBITDA targets operated in tandem to   motivate the executives to grow and diversify our portfolio while at the same time motivating them to responsibly manage our capital structure and use of leverage. The following table illustrates the performance metrics set forth above for the named executive officers at the threshold, target and high bonus levels. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measure   Threshold     Target     High   
 NFFO per share   $ 1.24     $ 1.28     $ 1.32   
 Capital Deployment   $ 100 million     $ 175 million     $ 250 million   
 Average Quarterly Net Debt to EBITDA     5.0x       4.7x       4.4x   
[END TABLE]
The following table illustrates the weighting of each performance measure for each named executive officer at the threshold, target and high bonus levels. For 2018, the compensation committee maintained the same short-term incentive weightings that it used for the 2017 annual cash incentive awards, which the compensation committee previously set after considering the results of our 2016 compensation survey. 
Performance Measure Weighting

[END TABLE]
The actual annual cash incentive earned by each named executive officer is determined by the sum of the percentage values for each metric at the level achieved for that metric multiplied by the annualized base salary. If the actual performance level achieved for any metric falls below the threshold level, no percentage is awarded for that metric. If the actual performance is above the high level, high level is awarded for that metric. If actual performance is in between, the percentage for each metric is calculated using straight line linear interpolation.  In February 2019, the compensation committee assessed performance based on actual results achieved for 2018. The compensation committee determined that the Company achieved a 2018 NFFO per share amount of $1.2760, 2018 capital deployment of approximately $117.7 million, and a 2018 average quarterly net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.85x. The following table illustrates the percentage value actually achieved for each performance metric based on our 2018 performance.

[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
In General. The compensation committee believes that stock-based incentives align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, and that the long-term compensation of the named executive officers should be linked to the value provided to our stockholders. Our stock-based incentives are structured in the form of full value stock awards payable in shares of our Common Stock that may increase or decrease in value over the multi-year vesting period. Our stock awards are designed to reward long-term performance – 50% of the number of stock awards earned based on 2018 performance are subject to additional performance-based vesting over a four-year performance period and will only vest if we achieve the objective NFFO per share growth hurdles described below. In addition, we use stock-based compensation as a retention tool. Because the stock awards generally vest over a multi-year period subject to continued employment with the Company (and subject to the achievement of the applicable performance-vesting conditions), these awards provide our executives with an ongoing incentive to continue their employment with the Company and to maximize stockholder value.  Design for Awards Earned Based on 2018 Performance. For 2018, the compensation committee used the same performance-based restricted stock award multipliers that it had established for the named executive officers in 2017, with the multipliers for Mr. Lamb set consistent with the multipliers established for Mr. Sedgwick. In setting the amount of each named executive officer's target stock-based incentive opportunity, the compensation committee previously considered the results of our 2016 compensation survey. 
The multipliers for 2018 were established as a percentage of each named executive officer's annualized base salary, as set forth in the table below: 
Performance Measure Weighting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Level    NFFO per share     Capital Deployment     Net Debt to EBITDA     Total   
 Gregory K. Stapley    Threshold      70%      30%      50%      150%  
 William M. Wagner    Threshold      75%      30%      45%      150%  
 David M. Sedgwick    Threshold      50%      20%      30%      100%  
 Mark D. Lamb    Threshold      50%      20%      30%      100%  
[END TABLE]
2018 performance for our long-term equity incentive award program was measured using the same performance metrics used under our annual cash incentive award plan described above. If the total achieved percentage values under the cash incentive plan was less than the threshold level for the executive, the executive would not be eligible for any restricted stock award based on 2018 performance. If the total achieved percentage values under the cash incentive plan equaled the threshold level, the executive would earn a restricted stock award having a grant date value determined using the threshold multiplier. Similarly, if performance under the incentive plan was at either the target or high level, the executive would earn a restricted stock award having a grant date value determined using either the target or high multiplier, as applicable. If the actual performance level achieved for any metric falls below the threshold level, no percentage is awarded for that metric. If the actual performance is above the high level, high level is awarded for that metric. If actual performance is in between, the percentage for each metric is calculated using straight line linear interpolation. However, each executive's maximum multiplier is capped at the percentage of annualized base salary reflected in the high column above (i.e., 350% for Mr. Stapley, 250% for Mr. Wagner, 225% for Mr. Sedgwick and 225% for Mr. Lamb). 
Once the applicable achieved performance multiplier is determined based on our performance, we multiply the performance multiplier by the executive's annualized base salary to determine the grant date fair value of each executive's restricted stock award. This grant date fair value is then converted into an actual number of restricted shares by dividing the grant date value by the closing stock price on the grant date. 
50% of the number of any restricted shares awarded for 2018 performance are subject to additional performance-based vesting conditions over a four-year performance period that begins in 2019. These performance vesting shares are split into four separate substantially equal tranches, with one tranche eligible to vest at the end of each of the 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 calendar years. In order for any tranche to vest at the end of the applicable calendar year, we must achieve NFFO per share growth of at least 6% for the year. If the   applicable NFFO per share growth target is not achieved for any calendar year in the four-year performance period, the tranche of shares eligible to vest for the missed year will be eligible to vest at the end of any subsequent calendar year in the performance period if we are able to achieve cumulative NFFO per share growth of at least 6% per year during the performance period through the end of the applicable measurement year. Any dividends payable on these performance vesting shares are subject to the same performance vesting conditions as the underlying shares, and will only become payable if the performance vesting conditions for the underlying shares are achieved. The compensation committee believes these NFFO growth performance vesting shares, which it first introduced beginning with the long-term equity incentive awards granted in 2018 for 2017 performance, increase the percentage of our long-term stock based incentives that are subject to multi-year performance vesting conditions and further incentivize our named executive officers to drive our per share NFFO growth. 
The remaining 50% of the number of any restricted shares awarded for 2018 performance are subject to a time-based vesting requirement. These time-based shares are also split into four separate substantially equal tranches so that the time-based shares will vest ratably in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date. This four-year vesting period is the same as the vesting period that applied to the restricted stock awards earned based on 2017 performance and one year longer than the three-year vesting period that applied to the restricted stock awards earned based on 2016 performance. 
The following table illustrates the performance multiplier actually achieved, and the value of the equity incentive award granted to each named executive officer in February 2019, based on our 2018 performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Actual Equity Incentive Performance     Base Salary      Equity Incentive Award ($)   
 Gregory K. Stapley      264%    $ 545,000      $ 1,438,800   
 William M. Wagner      205%    $ 342,000      $ 699,390   
 David M. Sedgwick      160%    $ 315,000      $ 502,425   
 Mark D. Lamb      160%    $ 315,000      $ 502,425   
[END TABLE]
Because these restricted stock awards were not granted until 2019, they are not included in the "Summary Compensation Table – 2016 – 2018" of this Proxy Statement under applicable SEC rules. They will instead be reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in our proxy statement to be filed in 2020. However, we note that because of the application of the 2018 performance multiplier, the value of the equity incentive award granted to each named executive officer in February 2019 based on 2018 performance is less than the amount of the equity award granted in February 2018 for 2017 performance that is reported in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Design for Awards Earned Based on 2017 Performance. For 2017, the compensation committee also established performance-based restricted stock award multipliers for each named executive officer, and performance was measured using the same performance metrics used under our 2017 annual incentive plan. This was the first year that the compensation committee introduced NFFO growth performance vesting shares, with 50% of the number of restricted shares awarded for 2017 performance subject to additional performance-based vesting conditions over a four-year performance period that began in 2018, with one tranche eligible to vest at the end of each of the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 calendar years. Similar to the NFFO growth performance vesting shares awarded for 2018 performance as described above, each tranche vests at the end of the applicable calendar year only if we achieve NFFO per share growth of at least 6% for the year. If the applicable NFFO per share growth target is not achieved for any calendar year in the four-year performance period, the tranche of shares eligible to vest for the missed year will be eligible to vest at the end of any subsequent calendar year in the performance period if we are able to achieve cumulative NFFO per share growth of at least 6% per year during the performance period through the end of the applicable measurement year. Because we achieved NFFO per share growth of approximately 10.3% in 2018, the first tranche of the performance shares awarded for 2017 performance vested at the end of the 2018 calendar year for each of the named executive officers and was paid in   February 2019. At the time of this payment, we also paid each named executive officer a cash amount equal to the dividends that had accrued with respect to the first tranche of performance shares, which dividends only became payable upon achievement of the performance vesting conditions for the underlying shares. 
The remaining 50% of the restricted shares that were awarded for 2017 performance are subject to a four-year time based vesting requirement, with the earned restricted shares vesting ratably in four substantially equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
The Summary Compensation Table includes the restricted stock awards that were granted to our named executive officers in 2018 based on 2017 performance. For more information on these awards, see our proxy statement filed in 2018. 
Severance Benefits 
We believe that severance protections, particularly in the context of the uncertainty surrounding any potential change in control transaction, play a valuable role in attracting and retaining quality executive officers. Accordingly, in February 2019, we entered into a change in control and severance agreement with each of our named executive officers (each, a "CIC and Severance Agreement"). We believe that the level of potential benefits helps us to retain our qualified executive team and is more consistent with the severance benefits provided by our Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers than our prior practice of providing no severance benefits to the named executive officers. 
As described in more detail below under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," pursuant to the CIC and Severance Agreement, each of the named executive officers is entitled to severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment by us without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in each executive's CIC and Severance Agreement), with the level of severance benefits enhanced if such a termination of employment occurs upon or following a change in control of the Company. None of the severance benefits payable under the CIC and Severance Agreement is a "single trigger" benefit triggered by the occurrence of a change in control, and benefits under the CIC and Severance Agreement are only payable on a "double trigger" basis as a result of a qualifying termination of employment. Also as described in more detail below under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," the CIC and Severance Agreement also entitles each named executive officer to specified benefits if the executive's employment is terminated as a result of an "authorized retirement" or due to the executive's death or "disability" (as such terms are defined in each executive's CIC and Severance Agreement). No named executive officer is entitled to receive a "gross-up" or similar payment for any excise taxes that may become payable in connection with a change in control pursuant to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, and, depending on what results in the best after-tax benefit for the executive, benefits may be "cut back" instead in such circumstances. 
In addition, under the terms of our stockholder-approved equity incentive plan, outstanding restricted stock awards will be subject to accelerated vesting in connection with a change in control of the Company (with outstanding performance-based awards vesting at the targeted performance level). Please see the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section below for additional details. 
401(k) Retirement Plan 
We adopted a 401(k) retirement plan that was originally effective as of June 1, 2014. Full-time employees who have completed three months of service have the opportunity to participate in the 401(k) plan. Our 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code. Employees are able to elect to defer a portion of their eligible compensation not to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit in the form of elective deferral contributions to our 401(k) plan. Our 401(k) plan also has a "catch-up contribution" feature for employees eligible to defer amounts over the statutory limit that applies to all other employees. We provide a "safe harbor"   nonelective contribution of 3% of each participant's compensation per plan year at the end of each plan year. Participants are always vested in their personal contributions to the 401(k) plan, and Company nonelective contributions are also vested once made. 
Compensation Governance Practices 
Anti-Hedging, Pledging and Derivatives Policy 
The Company considers it improper and inappropriate for the Company's directors, executive officers and other employees to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in the Company's securities and other transactions in the Company's securities that create the potential for heightened legal risk or the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct even if they occur at a time when the individual is not aware of material nonpublic information. Accordingly, the Company prohibits these individuals from engaging in short-term trading of the Company's securities or in any hedging transactions such as, but not limited to, zero-cost collars, equity swaps and forward sale contracts, absent preclearance. The Company also prohibits these individuals from holding Company securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan absent preclearance. 
Compensation Clawback Policy 
The Board has adopted a compensation recoupment policy whereby in the event of a restatement of our financial statements to correct a material error, the compensation committee is required to review our incentive compensation awards and may, if it determines appropriate after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, require the reimbursement of the incremental incentive compensation that an executive officer received as a result of the incorrect financial results. Annual bonus payments, long-term cash incentives, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (including performance stock units) and other equity incentive awards that are granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure are each subject to the terms of this clawback policy. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board has adopted a stock ownership policy that is applicable to our executive officers and directors. We believe that this new policy aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders by requiring executive officers to have direct ownership in shares of our Common Stock. The policy requires our Chief Executive Officer to own shares of our Common Stock having a value equal to at least ten times his annual base salary, and each of our other executive officers to own shares of our Common Stock having a value equal to at least five times his annual base salary. Shares subject to stock options are not considered owned by the executive for purposes of the policy. The executives covered by the policy are required to be in compliance with the ownership levels above within five years after adoption of the policy, and are required to retain 50% of the net after-tax shares received in respect of equity awards until they are in compliance. 
Policy with Respect to Section 162(m) 
In making its compensation decisions, the compensation committee considers the impact of Section 162(m) of the Code. Under Section 162(m), the Company is generally precluded from deducting compensation in excess of $1.0 million per year paid to our current or former named executive officers. Certain awards granted before November 2, 2017 that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures that were set by the Company's compensation committee under a plan approved by the Company's stockholders, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1.0 million deductibility limit. However, because we are taxed as a REIT, Section 162(m) considerations are not as significant for us as for other publicly-traded companies that are not taxed as REITs, and the compensation committee maintains the flexibility to approve compensation for the named executive officers based upon an overall determination of what it believes to be in our best interests, even if the compensation paid may not be deductible.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The compensation committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with management the disclosures contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. Based upon this review and discussion, the compensation committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section be included in this Proxy Statement. 
The foregoing report of the compensation committee does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed filed, incorporated by reference into or a part of any other filing by the Company (including any future filings) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates such report by reference therein. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
Messrs. Barbieri, Kline and Plumb were members of the compensation committee during all of 2018. Mr. Lindahl was a member of the compensation committee until his resignation from the Board effective November 29, 2018. Ms. Laing was appointed as a member of the compensation committee in February 2019. During the past fiscal year, none of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our Company or had any relationships requiring disclosure by the Company under the rules of the SEC requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related party transactions. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions) of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving on our Board of Directors or compensation committee.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following section describes the benefits that may become payable to the named executive officers in connection with a termination of their employment with us or a change in control of the Company. 
Benefits Payable Upon Termination or Change in Control Occurring on December 31, 2018 
During 2018, our named executive officers did not have any employment agreements or severance agreements with the Company. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, the named executive officers were not entitled to any cash severance benefits upon any type of termination of employment with the Company. 
Pursuant to the terms of our stockholder-approved equity incentive plan, outstanding restricted stock awards granted to the named executive officers under the equity incentive plan are subject to accelerated vesting in connection with a change in control of the Company (with outstanding performance-based awards vesting at the targeted performance level). 
The following table provides information concerning the potential payments that would have been made to each named executive officer in the event of a change in control (with such potential payments calculated assuming that such event occurred on December 31, 2018, as prescribed by the SEC's disclosure rules). 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Mark D. Lamb      1,391,829   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The equity acceleration value for each named executive officer is based upon the closing price of our Common  Stock ($18.46) on December 31, 2018, which was the last trading day in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
 Change in Control and Severance Agreement 
On February 5, 2019, we entered into a CIC and Severance Agreement with each of our named executive officers. 
The CIC and Severance Agreement provides that if an executive's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or by the executive for a "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the CIC and Severance Agreement), the executive will be entitled to receive the following benefits: (1) a lump sum payment equal to one times (or two times for Mr. Stapley) the executive's annual base salary, (2) a lump sum payment equal to a pro-rata portion of the executive's target annual cash incentive opportunity, and (3) reimbursement of the premiums charged to continue the executive's and his dependents' benefits under COBRA for up to 18 months (and subject to earlier termination upon the executive beginning new full-time employment) (the "COBRA Benefits"). 
If an executive's termination without cause or for good reason occurs upon or following a change in control of the Company, then in lieu of the benefits described above, the executive will be entitled to receive the following benefits: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times (or three times for Mr. Stapley) the sum of the executive's annual base salary plus average annual cash incentive opportunity actually earned for the three years preceding the year in which the executive's termination of employment occurs, (2) full vesting of all outstanding equity awards (with any performance-based awards vesting at the target performance level) and (3) the COBRA Benefits. No executive is entitled to receive a "gross-up" or similar payment for any excise taxes that may become payable in connection with a change in control of the Company, and, depending on what results in the best after-tax benefit for the executive, benefits may be "cut back" instead in such circumstances. 
If an executive's employment is terminated as a result of an "authorized retirement" (as such term is defined in the CIC and Severance Agreement), the executive will be entitled to receive the COBRA Benefits, full vesting of all outstanding time-based equity awards and continued eligibility to vest in any outstanding performance-based equity awards that may become earned based on actual performance. 
If an executive's employment terminates due to the executive's death or disability, the executive will be entitled to receive (1) a lump sum payment equal to the executive's target annual cash incentive opportunity, (2) full vesting of all outstanding equity awards (with any performance-based awards vesting at the target performance level) and (3) the COBRA Benefits (but only for up to 12 months). 
In order to receive any of the foregoing benefits payable upon a termination without cause, for good reason or an authorized retirement, the executive must execute and not revoke a full release of claims in favor of us. 
The CIC and Severance Agreement includes an indefinite restriction on an executive's disclosure of our confidential information and a 2-year post termination restriction on an executive's solicitation of our employees and independent contractors. 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in this proxy statement the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer). Based on SEC rules for this disclosure, we have determined that our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation for 2018 was $3,093,769, and the median of the total 2018 compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) was $21,347. Accordingly, we estimate the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation for 2018 to the median of the total 2018 compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) to be 144.9 to 1.  We continue to use the median employee identified in 2017 as the median employee for 2018. There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the median employee was identified that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. The median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was determined using the same rules that apply to reporting the compensation of our named executive officers (including our Chief Executive Officer) in the "Total" column of the "Summary Compensation Table – 2016 – 2018" above. The total compensation amounts included in the first paragraph of this pay ratio disclosure were determined based on that methodology. 
Unlike many of our Direct Competitor Peers and Compensation Peers that are also REITs, we directly employ certain full- and part-time employees at the facilities that we operate (who we refer to as the "Facility Employees"). Our Facility Employees work directly at the applicable property and are compensated differently than the employees who work directly for us performing REIT-level services related to the management and structure of our portfolio (who we refer to as the "REIT employees"). If we excluded the Facility Employees, we estimate the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation for 2018 to the median of the total 2018 compensation of all of our REIT employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) to be 5.8 to 1. As with our median employee, we used the same median REIT employee identified in 2017 as there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the median REIT employee was identified that we believe would significantly impact our median REIT employee pay ratio disclosure in this paragraph. We determined the median REIT employee's annual total compensation using the same methodology described above.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Director Compensation Program 
We provide cash and stock compensation to our non-employee directors for their services as directors or members of committees of the Board of Directors. We also reimburse our non-employee directors for their reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings of our Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors. 
Each member of our Board of Directors who is not our employee will receive the cash compensation for board services listed below, as applicable. Each member of our Board may elect to have his or her fees that would otherwise be paid in cash converted into an equity grant. For 2018, Messrs. Barbieri, Kline and Lindahl elected to receive a restricted stock award (subject to a one-year vesting requirement) in lieu of the cash compensation listed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• $45,000 per year for service as a Board member.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• $10,000 per year for service as chairperson of the audit committee and $10,000 per year for committee memberships  (with the fee fixed regardless of the number of committees served on).  
[END TABLE]
In addition, pursuant to the Independent Director Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors are entitled to receive annual, non-discretionary grants, generally granted on or around the date of our annual meeting of stockholders, of approximately $65,000 in restricted stock awards, which vest in full on the date of the following year's annual meeting of stockholders, subject to the non-employee director's continued service as a director through the vesting date. The number of shares of restricted stock subject to the 2018 award was determined by dividing $65,000 by the per-share closing price (in regular trading) of our Common Stock on the date of grant, rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board has adopted a stock ownership policy that is applicable to our executive officers and directors. We believe that this new policy aligns the interests of our directors with those of our stockholders by requiring directors to have direct ownership in shares of our Common Stock. The policy requires each non-employee director to own shares of our Common Stock having a value equal to at least six times his or her annual cash retainer (excluding additional retainers for chairpersons, committee members and meeting fees). Our non-employee directors are required to be in compliance with this ownership level within five years after adoption of the policy, and are required to retain 50% of the net after-tax shares received in respect of equity awards until they are in compliance.  2018 Director Compensation Table 
The following table sets forth the compensation paid to our non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The compensation paid to Mr. Stapley, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, is not included in this  table because he was an employee of the Company during his service as a director and received no compensation for his service as director. Mr. Stapley's compensation is disclosed in the "Summary Compensation Table –  2016 – 2018" above. The compensation for Mr. Lindahl reflects compensation paid or awarded prior to his resignation effective November 29, 2018. Ms. Laing is not included in this table because she was not appointed to  the Board until January 15, 2019.  
  (2)  Messrs. Barbieri, Kline and Lindahl each elected to receive all of their 2018 annual retainers in the form of  restricted stock awards (subject to a one-year vesting requirement) in lieu of the cash compensation listed above. Accordingly, Mr. Barbieri received 3,346 shares of restricted stock totaling $55,000 for  his service on the Board in 2018, Mr. Kline received 3,954 shares of restricted stock totaling $65,000 for his service on the Board in 2018, and Mr. Lindahl received 3,346 shares of restricted stock totaling $55,000 for his service on the  Board in 2018. The value of the restricted stock awards in the preceding sentence is the grant date value of the restricted stock awards.  
  (3)  The amounts in this column represent the aggregate fair value of each annual equity award on its grant date,  computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. We valued the stock awards as of the grant date by multiplying the closing price of our Common Stock on that date by the number of shares of stock awarded. As of December 31, 2018, each of our non-employee directors held the following number of unvested restricted stock awards (which includes the unvested restricted stock awards that each non-employee director  elected to receive in lieu of his 2018 cash compensation as disclosed above in footnote (2)):

 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION 
We currently maintain one equity compensation plan: The CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company.

 PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY APPROVAL OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act (which was added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and the related compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and to foster a pay-for-performance culture. Our compensation programs are designed to reward our named executive officers for the achievement of the Company's corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation of long-term value for stockholders, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board of Directors or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors. Although the vote is non-binding, the compensation committee will consider the voting results when it evaluates whether any changes should be made to the Company's compensation program. 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure in this Proxy Statement." 
We intend to provide our stockholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers each year at the annual meeting of stockholders. It is expected that the next vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers will be held at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them FOR our named executive officer compensation.  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Pre-Approval Policies 
The audit committee has adopted a policy that requires the audit committee to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee has delegated to the chairperson of the audit committee the authority to pre-approve any audit and permitted non-audit services necessary between regularly scheduled meetings of the audit committee and the chairperson must then report any such approval decisions to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. Our audit committee pre-approved all audit, audit-related, tax and other services performed by EY in fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2017. 
Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Current Report"), on February 25, 2019, following a comprehensive process, the Audit Committee dismissed EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
The reports of EY on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and the subsequent interim period through and including the date of EY's dismissal, (i) there were no "disagreements" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of EY, would have caused EY to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years or any subsequent interim period through the date of dismissal, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
We provided EY with a copy of the disclosures it made in the Current Report prior to the time the Current Report was filed with the SEC. We requested that EY furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not   it agrees with the statements made in the Current Report. A copy of EY's letter, dated February 28, 2019, was attached as Exhibit 16.1 to the Current Report and confirmed that EY agreed with the statements we made in the Current Report. 
On February 27, 2019, the Audit Committee appointed Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and the subsequent interim period through and including the date of Deloitte's appointment, neither the Company, nor anyone acting on its behalf, consulted Deloitte regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Deloitte that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a "disagreement" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).  PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
We are asking the stockholders to ratify our audit committee's appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. See above under "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" for additional information. We are not required to submit the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for stockholder approval. However, we are submitting the appointment for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the audit committee will consider whether or not to retain Deloitte. Even if the appointment is ratified, the audit committee may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
A representative of Deloitte will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. A representative of EY is not expected to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our audit committee has reviewed and discussed with our management our audited consolidated financial statements and the establishment and maintenance of internal control over financial reporting and has discussed with EY, our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. 
Our audit committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from EY required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding EY's communications with the audit committee concerning independence. Our audit committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services provided to us by EY is compatible with maintaining EY's independence and has discussed with EY its independence. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, our audit committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the Company's year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the SEC on February 13, 2019. The audit committee also appointed Deloitte to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and is seeking ratification of such appointment by the stockholders. 
The foregoing report of the audit committee does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed filed, incorporated by reference into or a part of any other filing by us (including any future filings) under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate such report by reference therein.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our equity securities. Officers, directors, and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we have received and written representations from certain reporting persons that they filed all required reports, we believe that all of our officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during fiscal 2018 other than a Form 3 that was filed late in connection with Mr. Lamb's appointment as a Section 16 officer. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Since January 1, 2018, there has not been, nor is there any proposed transaction in which we were or will be a party or in which we were or will be a participant, involving an amount that exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any director, executive officer, beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than the compensation arrangements and other agreements and transactions which are described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above. 
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy regarding the approval of any "related person transaction," which is any transaction or series of transactions in which we or any of our subsidiaries is or are to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a "related person" (as defined under SEC rules) has a direct or indirect material interest. Under the policy, a related person is required to disclose to our Chief Financial Officer any proposed related person transaction and certain facts and circumstances about the proposed transaction. Our Chief Financial Officer would then assess that information and, if determined to be a related party transaction, submit the transaction to our audit committee for consideration. Based on our audit committee's consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, our audit committee will decide whether or not to approve such transaction and will generally approve only those transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of CareTrust REIT. If we become aware of an existing related person transaction that has not been pre-approved under this policy, the transaction will be referred to our audit committee, which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. Our policy requires any director who may be interested in a related person transaction to recuse himself or herself from any consideration of such related person transaction.

Stockholders may present proposals for action at a future meeting only if they comply with the requirements of the proxy rules established by the SEC and our bylaws, as further described below:

Dated: March 18, 2019  APPENDIX A – RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
Funds from operations, or "FFO," as defined by NAREIT, and funds available for distribution, or "FAD," are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. 
FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition. 
FAD is defined as FFO excluding non-cash income and expenses, such as amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred financing costs and the effects of straight-line rent. The Company considers FAD to be a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the Company's operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors, analysts and other interested parties compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies on a more consistent basis. 
In addition, the Company reports normalized FFO, or "NFFO," and normalized FAD, or "NFAD," which adjust FFO and FAD for certain revenue and expense items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results, such as costs associated with the Spin-Off,written-off deferred financing fees, expensed acquisition costs, and other unanticipated charges. By excluding these items, investors, analysts and our management can compare NFFO and NFAD between periods more consistently. 
While FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD are relevant and widely-used measures of operating performance among REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company's liquidity or operating performance. FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund future cash requirements. 
Further, the Company's computation of FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD may not be comparable to FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define FAD differently than the Company does. 
The Company believes that the use of FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The Company considers FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance and setting incentive and executive compensation levels because, by excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, impairment charges and real estate depreciation and amortization, and, for FAD and NFAD, by excluding non-cash income and expenses such as amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred financing costs, and the effects of straight-line rent, FFO, NFFO, FAD and NFAD can help investors compare the Company's operating performance between periods and to other REITs. 
A-1 
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to NFFO, NFAD and NFFO and NFAD per share for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
