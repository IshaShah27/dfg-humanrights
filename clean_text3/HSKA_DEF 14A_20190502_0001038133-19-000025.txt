Eligible stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are entitled and requested to vote on the items of business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 process, the compensation of our Directors and most highly paid Executive Officers, and certain other required information. Our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (our "2018 Form 10-K"), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), is also enclosed.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What items of business will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
A: The items of business scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) To approve an amendment to our Charter and our Bylaws to declassify our Board of Directors (resulting in the "Restated Charter" and the "Updated Bylaws"); 
(2) The election of a Director nominee to serve on our Board of Directors;

[END TABLE]
We will also consider other business that properly comes before the 2019 Annual Meeting, including, if practicable, conducting an advisory vote with respect to discretionary voting by proxyholders if, and only if, such other business properly comes before the 2019 Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals? 
A: The Board recommends that you vote FOR the amendments to the Charter and the Bylaws to declassify our Board, FOR the election of a  
[END TABLE]
Director nominee, FOR the Restated Plan, FOR the ratification of Plante & Moran, PLLC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, FOR the offering of approval of the Company's executive compensation policies, FOR one year as the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation, FOR your preference being that the proxyholders exercise their voting discretion in a manner they determine to be in the best interest of the Company's stockholders, if other business properly comes before the 2019 Annual Meeting and you are voting by proxy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What classes of stock does Heska's Charter authorize? 
A: Our Charter authorizes three classes of stock.  First, our Charter authorizes a class of Traditional Common Stock and defines it as the "Original Common Stock".  We will refer to this class of stock in these proxy materials as the "Original Common Stock".  Second, our Charter authorizes a class of Public Common Stock and defines it as the "Common Stock" or the "NOL Restricted Common Stock".  We will refer to this class of stock in these proxy materials as the "Public Common Stock" or the "NOL Restricted Common Stock".  Third, our Charter authorizes a class of Preferred Stock.  We shall refer to this class of stock in these proxy materials as "Preferred Stock".  For the purpose of these proxy materials, "Common Stock" shall mean collectively Original Common Stock and Public Common Stock. 
Q: Who is an eligible stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
A: Stockholders holding Common Stock registered with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), our registrar and transfer agent ("Registrar Listed Shares"), as of the close of business on March 13, 2019 (including shares legally issued but not yet processed by Computershare, if any), the Record Date, are eligible and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Each stockholder is entitled to one  
[END TABLE]
 vote for each share of Common Stock held on the Record Date.  As of the Record Date, 7,742,222 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding; and no shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding.  A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for ten days prior to the meeting during normal business hours at our offices at 3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Loveland, Colorado 80538. You may review the list when it becomes available by contacting our Secretary as outlined under "Who can help answer my questions?" below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I know if I hold Registrar Listed Shares? 
A: In general, there are two ways in which you may hold Common Stock registered with Computershare: Physical Certificate and "Direct" Registration.  With a Physical Certificate, there is an actual, hard copy stock certificate representing your ownership of Common Stock which is registered with Computershare.  With Direct Registration, there is no paper certificate but your shares are registered with Computershare.  Either way, you would have an account with Computershare and Computershare would have sent you these proxy materials. 
[END TABLE]
If someone other than Computershare sent you these proxy materials, it is likely you do not hold Registrar Listed Shares in an affiliated account.  A large portion of our Registrar Listed Shares are held by Cede & Co., a nominee of Depository Trust Company ("DTC Shares") - as we believe is typical for publicly traded companies. We believe DTC Shares are more conveniently publicly traded than other Registrar Listed Shares and thus represent most of our daily trading volume. If a broker buys a position in DTC Shares from another broker, we believe the identity of the parties is typically not reported to Computershare or us. We believe Depository Trust Company maintains records of the DTC Shares allocated to different entities, such as brokers and banks, and in the case of a broker buying a position in DTC Shares from another broker will record an increase in the number of DTC Shares allocated to the purchasing broker equal to the number of shares involved as well as a corresponding decrease in the number of shares allocated to the selling broker. DTC Shares allocated to a given broker in this way may represent many client accounts for which the broker or the broker's agent maintains internal records, which we do not believe are generally shared with Depository Trust Company or Computershare.
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee and are not registered in your name with Computershare, such shares are herein referred to as being held in "Street Name", and you probably received these materials through such broker, bank or other nominee.  We believe over 90% of our shares are held in Street Name.  Computershare will generally not be able to identify the holders of shares held in Street Name as stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting without further arrangements by the corresponding broker, bank or other nominee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How can I vote at the Annual Meeting if my shares are held in Street Name? 
A: If you wish to vote shares held in Street Name at the Annual Meeting, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to obtain the proper documentation - which should be documentation entitling you to vote a certain number of Registrar Listed Shares at the Annual Meeting which we can verify as legitimate - and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting. 
Q: Can eligible stockholders who are unable or unwilling to attend the Annual Meeting vote? 
A: Yes, such stockholders may vote by proxy. 
Q: How can I direct a vote by proxy? 
A: If you hold Registrar Listed Shares you may: (a) indicate your voting preferences, sign and date each proxy card by following the corresponding instructions on each proxy card you receive and return each such proxy card in the postage prepaid envelope or by other  
[END TABLE]
 means acceptable to Computershare; (b) indicate your voting preferences via the telephone by following the corresponding instructions; (c) indicate your voting preferences via the internet by following the corresponding instructions; or (d) bring a proxy card you have completed, including your voting preferences, signature and dated as of the Annual Meeting if necessary, to the Annual Meeting along with a copy of proper identification, if required, to the Annual Meeting.
If you have shares held in Street Name, you should indicate your vote for the shares via any procedure(s) adopted by your broker, bank or other nominee. These may include directing proxy votes by mail, telephone via a touch tone dialpad or the internet.  Proxy solicitors, including any proxy solicitor(s) we may engage, may make arrangements with certain brokers, banks and other nominees where you may be able to direct proxy votes on a taped telephone call.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How can I change my proxy vote or revoke my proxy? 
A: For Registrar Listed Shares, you have the right to revoke your proxy and change your voting instructions at any time before the meeting by notifying our Secretary, or returning a later-dated proxy card, updating your vote via the telephone by following the corresponding instructions or updating your vote via the internet by following the corresponding instructions. You may also revoke your proxy and change your vote by voting by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
For shares held in Street Name, you should follow any corresponding procedure(s) adopted by your broker, bank or other nominee. These may include procedures as simple as a later vote via telephone or the internet to change your vote.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who can help answer my questions? 
A: If you have any questions about the Annual Meeting or how to vote or revoke your proxy, you should contact: 
[END TABLE]
Heska Corporation
Attn:  Secretary
3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue
Loveland, Colorado 80538
(970) 493-7272
If you need additional copies of this proxy statement or voting materials, please contact our Secretary as described above. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card? 
A: It probably means that you hold shares of Common Stock in more than one account. Direct your votes on all proxies to ensure that all of your shares are voted if you do not plan to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Q: Who will serve as inspector of elections? 
A: The inspector of elections will be a representative of Computershare, our registrar and transfer agent. 
Q: How do you expect votes will be counted for quorum and other purposes? 
A: We intend to count shares underlying proxies containing directions indicating a "for", "withhold", "against", or "abstain" vote, as well as any legitimate proxies without any voting instructions as "present" for purposes of determining a quorum.   
[END TABLE]
We intend to consider an abstention or a non-vote on a given matter, including indicated via proxy, to be a forfeiture of the right to vote on that matter and a forfeiture of the voting power present at the 2019 Annual Meeting underlying the forfeited votes regarding that matter. Accordingly, if you, at the Annual Meeting or indicated via proxy, abstain or do not indicate a vote on a given matter, your shares will not be voted "for" or "against" that matter and will not be considered as present and entitled to vote on that matter.  However, you may abstain on a given matter for a certain portion of your shares and vote on the same matter with the remaining portion of your shares without forfeiting the votes underlying the shares you choose to vote.  For  example, a stockholder who has two accounts with 50 shares in each account may choose to abstain on a proposal with 50 shares and vote for the same proposal with the other 50 shares.  In this case, the stockholder would forfeit his right to vote 50 shares on the proposal and would have his other 50 votes count for the proposal.  In addition, an abstention or a non-vote on any matter will not affect your ability to vote on any other matter.
The underlying broker, bank or other nominee of shares held in Street Name may report consolidated proxy vote totals to Computershare. The underlying broker, bank or other nominee of shares held in Street Name may not treat voting preferences such as non-votes in their proxy voting materials in the same manner we intend to. For example, if you do not indicate a vote on a given matter, the underlying broker, bank or other nominee may be permitted by law, rule and policy to exercise voting discretion on this matter and may direct a vote for the corresponding shares accordingly. Similarly, if you do not indicate a vote on a given matter, the underlying broker, bank or other nominee may be permitted by law, rule and policy not to direct a vote for the underlying shares on any matter and may not direct a vote for the corresponding shares at all, including on other matters for which you may have indicated a voting preference.
If you hold shares in Street Name through a broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or nominee may not be permitted by law, rule or policy to exercise voting discretion with respect to certain matters to be acted upon. If you do not give your broker, bank or nominee specific instructions, your underlying shares may not be voted on those matters, potentially resulting in so-called "broker non-votes," and, if so, will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to those matters. In some cases, your broker, bank or other nominee may not be permitted by law, rule or policy to exercise voting discretion with respect to any matters to be acted upon and, in the absence of specific instructions from you, may not vote or submit a proxy card to anyone at all regarding these matters. In such a circumstance, your underlying shares will not be considered present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and will not be voted on any matters to be acted upon therein.
We suggest you clearly indicate your voting preferences on all matters to help ensure your voting preferences are accurately recorded.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What are the quorum and voting requirements for the Annual Meeting? 
A: The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.  Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, a quorum requires 3,871,112 shares. 
[END TABLE]
The amendments to the Charter and Bylaws presented in Proposal No. 1 is to be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock (a "Two-thirds Supermajority"), or a minimum of 5,161,485 shares. 
The election of a Director presented in Proposal No. 2 is to be determined by a plurality of the votes of the shares of Common Stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter (a "Plurality Vote") 
The Restated Plan presented in Proposal No. 3 is to be approved by both (1) the vote of the majority of the shares of our Common Stock having voting power present in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the subject matter at the Annual Meeting, and (2) a minimum affirmative vote of a majority of our quorum requirement (with a vote meeting both criteria (1) and (2) being defined as a "Quorum Majority"). Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, the affirmative vote of a minimum of 1,935,557 shares will be required to achieve a Quorum Majority. The ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 in Proposal No. 4 is to be approved by the vote of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock having voting power present in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the subject matter (a "Voting Majority").
An offer of approval of our executive compensation in a non-binding advisory vote in Proposal No. 5 is to be obtained by the vote of a Voting Majority.
All other business which may properly come before the Annual Meeting is to be determined by a Quorum Majority, unless the matter is one upon which by express provision of law, or our Charter or our Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if additional matters are presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
A: Other than the six specific items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If other business properly comes before the Annual Meeting, we intend to try to conduct an advisory vote of stockholders who have granted the persons named below as proxyholders a proxy regarding the preference of these stockholders' regarding the manner in which the below persons named as proxyholders exercise their voting discretion or otherwise communicate any related information in this regard to such proxyholders, and then proceed to consideration of the other business which has properly come before the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxyholders - Eleanor F. Baker, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Catherine I. Grassman, our Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, and Christopher D. Sveen, our Vice President, General Counsel - will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters presented for a vote at the meeting. It is  
[END TABLE]
important to note that while the proxyholders may consider any advisory vote or related information in such a circumstance, the proxyholders retain full discretion to vote as they may determine regardless of outcome of any advisory vote or related information.    
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if the nominee for Director is unable to stand for election? 
A: If for any unforeseen reason our nominee is not available as a candidate for Director, the persons named as proxyholders - Ms. Baker, Ms. Grassman, and Mr. Sveen - expect to vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates who may be nominated by the Board, although the proxyholders retain full discretion to vote as they may determine. 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the meeting? 
A: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting, and publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K (a "Form 8-K") to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.  If final voting results are not available within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we intend to publish preliminary voting results in a Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC on the fourth business day following the Annual Meeting and then publish final voting results in a Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days following the final voting results becoming known. 
Q: Who bears the costs of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
A: Heska is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, printing, assembling and mailing these proxy materials. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, certain of our directors and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by mail, telephone, email, facsimile or other means. No additional compensation will be paid to these people for such solicitation. We have engaged Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902 ("Morrow  
[END TABLE]
 Sodali") to solicit proxies on our behalf for a fee of $12,500, which may increase based on Morrow Sodali's solicitation activities with non-objecting beneficial owners of our Common Stock, plus reimbursement of certain disbursements. We believe our engagement with Morrow Sodali is consistent with customary terms and conditions for soliciting proxies. Charges under the engagement may increase if we direct Morrow Sodali to engage in activities not currently contemplated. We may enlist the assistance of brokerage firms, fiduciaries, custodians and other third party solicitation firms in soliciting proxies. If we elect to engage any such assistance, we expect our arrangements with the solicitation firm(s) will be on customary terms and conditions, the cost of which is not anticipated to be material to us. Upon request, we will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to stockholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Is a corporate 2018 Annual Report available? 
A: A corporate 2018 Annual Report was posted to the investor relations portion of our Corporate website on or about March 25, 2019. We have not mailed physical copies of our corporate 2018 Annual Report with this mailing in order to reduce the cost of conducting the Annual Meeting as compared to comparable costs in previous years. If you wish to obtain a hardcopy of our corporate 2018 Annual Report, please contact our Secretary as follows:

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: May I propose actions for consideration at next year's Annual Meeting or nominate individuals to serve as Directors? 
A: Yes. You may submit proposals, including Director nominations, for consideration at future stockholder meetings. All proposals or nominations should be addressed to: Secretary,  
[END TABLE]
Heska Corporation, 3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Loveland, Colorado 80538.
Stockholder Proposals: For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for the annual meeting next year, the written proposal must be received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices under either (1) Rule 14a-8 (a "Rule 14 Proposal") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or (2) the Bylaws of Heska (a "Bylaws Proposal"). A Rule 14 Proposal must be received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices no later than November 29, 2019. If the date of next year's annual meeting is moved more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of this year's annual meeting, the deadline for inclusion of proposals in our proxy statement is instead a reasonable period of time before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials. Such proposals will also need to comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. For a Bylaws Proposal, the stockholder must deliver a written notice of intent to propose such action in accordance with our Bylaws, which in general require that the notice be received by us not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which notice of the prior year's annual meeting was mailed to stockholders. These proxy materials for the Annual Meeting are to be mailed on or about March 28, 2019. This means that for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, any such proposal must be received no earlier than December 29, 2019 and no later than January 28, 2020.
Director Nominees: You may propose Director candidates for consideration by the Board's Corporate Governance Committee. Any such recommendations should be directed to our Secretary at our principal executive offices. In addition, you may nominate a Director for consideration by Heska's stockholders if you give timely and adequate notice to our Secretary of your intention to  make such nomination in accordance with our Bylaws, which require that the notice be received by the Secretary within the time periods described above under "Stockholder Proposals" and with the detail regarding your nomination as is required by our Bylaws.
Copy of Bylaw Provisions: You may contact our Secretary at our principal executive offices for a copy of the relevant Bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating Director candidates. A copy of our current Bylaws has also been filed with the SEC and is included as an exhibit with our 2018 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. This document is accessible at the website of the SEC at www.sec.gov. BOARD STRUCTURE AND COMMITTEES
Our Board has three standing Committees, each of which is chaired by an independent Director: (1) Audit (the "Audit Committee"), (2) Compensation (the "Compensation Committee") and (3) Corporate Governance (the "Corporate Governance Committee"). The membership during 2018 and the function of each Committee are described below. Our Board held twelve meetings during 2018. Our Board currently has eight (8) Directors, arranged into three classes with overlapping three-year terms of service:  Scott W. Humphrey, Chair (term set to expire in 2021), Mark F. Furlong (term set to expire in 2019), G. Irwin Gordon (term set to expire in 2019), Sharon J. Larson (term set to expire in 2021), David E. Sveen, Ph.D. (term set to expire in 2020), Bonnie J. Trowbridge (term set to expire in 2021), Kevin S. Wilson (term set to expire in 2020) and Carol A. Wrenn (term set to expire in 2019). At the time of our Annual Meeting, our Board is to be reduced to six (6) members. We encourage our directors to attend each Annual Meeting and all of our Directors attended our last annual meeting of stockholders in May 2018. With the exception of Mr. Furlong, who joined our Board in March 2019, all Board members have attended at least 75% of all Board and applicable Committee meetings during 2018.
Board Leadership Structure
We currently have separated the role of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer with Scott W. Humphrey serving as Chair of our Board and Kevin S. Wilson serving as our Chief Executive Officer. In considering the separation of the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles, the Board considered corporate governance, potential conflict of interest and time management questions. 
Board Risk Oversight 
Our business, including risk oversight, is conducted with the advice, counsel and direction of our Board. The formal channel for risk-related information to be communicated to our Board is through our Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer periodically conveys the Company's risks, including credit risks, liquidity risks and operational risks to the Board at Board meetings and through other forms of communication, as appropriate. Our Board may also discuss the Company's risks with other members of management as directed by our Chief Executive Officer or as part of another Board function. For example, our Chief Accounting Officer has discussed credit risk with directors during Audit Committee meetings primarily focused on accounting determinations.
Board Independence
Our Board has determined that the Director standing for election, Mr. Furlong, has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) and meets the requirements of "independence" as set forth in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards (the "Nasdaq Listing Standards"). Furthermore, the Board has determined that, with the exception of Mr. Wilson, Heska's Chief Executive Officer and President, all current members of the Board meet the definition of "independence" as set forth in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the Nasdaq Listing Standards.

Director Qualification and Nomination
Service on our Board varies from less than a month to eighteen years. All of our Directors have gained Company and industry specific knowledge as a result. The experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that qualify our Directors to serve on our Board are discussed on a Director-by-Director basis in the "Election of Directors" section of this document as well as in this "Board Structure and Committees" section. None of our directors is serving as a result of one specific qualification. It is the breadth of their individual experiences and the manner in which they complement each other as a group that make them individually and collectively attractive Directors. Our Corporate Governance Committee does not have an established policy for minimum qualifications of Director nominees or appointees. However, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Committee Charter, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders to obtain highly qualified candidates for the Board. Our Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates with excellent decision-making ability, business experience, relevant experience, personal integrity and reputation as candidates for nomination and appointment.
Our Corporate Governance Committee does not have an established policy for diversity of Director nominees or appointees. However, we believe diversity is inherent in our approach of seeking high quality individuals with complementary skills to create a group dynamic and decision making process that is even stronger than would be obtained by the mere summation of its individual contributors in isolation.
Our Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formalized process for identifying and evaluating nominees or appointees for Director. Our Corporate Governance Committee determines desired Board member skills and attributes and conducts searches for prospective Director candidates whose skills and attributes reflect those desired. This analysis may start with a Board evaluation, including determination of areas of strength and areas for improvement. Particular skills and experience may be desired in areas of improvement. Our Corporate Governance Committee may determine guidelines and parameters for a search for an individual with the desired skills and experience. Our Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate candidates identified by its own initiative as well as candidates referred to it by other members of the Board, by the Company's management, or by external sources. Our Corporate Governance Committee has utilized a third-party executive search firm in the past to identify candidates as well as other sources. Our Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a policy stating it will not consider unsolicited applications for Board membership.
Our Corporate Governance Committee will also consider nominees recommended by stockholders provided such recommendations are made in accordance with our Bylaws and the procedures described in this proxy statement under "Questions and Answers About the Proxy Materials and the 2019 Annual Meeting". Although to date no stockholder has presented any candidate for Board membership to us, it is expected that recommendations from stockholders would generally be considered in the same manner as recommendations by a Director or an Officer of the Company.
Stockholder Communication with our Board
Stockholders can contact our Board, any Committee thereof, or any Director in particular, by writing to them, c/o Heska Corporation, 3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Loveland, Colorado 80538, Attn: Secretary. We will forward any correspondence sent in the foregoing manner to the appropriate addressee without review by management.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The form and amount of compensation paid to the non-employee directors is reviewed from time to time by our Corporate Governance Committee. Any revisions to our Director Compensation policy have been recommended by our Corporate Governance Committee and approved by our Board. 
In 2018, our employee Director did not receive any separate compensation for Board activities.
Non-Employee Director Compensation
On each date of our Annual Meeting, each non-employee Director elected and each other continuing non-employee Director who was a Director immediately prior to the Annual Meeting is to receive  automatically shares of our Common Stock valued at $60,000 (the "New Value"), subject to a maximum grant of 5,000 shares (the "Share Cap") of our Common Stock. These grants are to vest (the "Vesting Time") in full on the latter of (i) the one year anniversary of the date of grant and (ii) the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the year following the year of grant for the award (the "Vesting Meeting"), subject to (i) the non-employee director's continued service to the Company through the Vesting Time, unless the non-employee director's current term expires at the Vesting Meeting in which case vesting is subject to the non-employee director's service to the Vesting Meeting and (ii) the non-employee director not engaging in "competition", as defined in a restricted stock agreement to be executed by the non-employee director, to the Vesting Time.  Any new non-employee Director appointed or elected to our Board between Annual Meetings is to be automatically granted shares of our Common Stock with New Value and Share Cap adjusted pro rata for the time until the next Annual Meeting and which vest at the corresponding Vesting Time.
Each non-employee Director is also entitled to an annual cash retainer in the amount of $40,000. The Company pays the annual retainer in advance, in quarterly installments on the first business day of each calendar quarter, subject to the non-employee director's continued service to the Company as a non-employee Director on such date.
Other cash compensation, payable in advance in quarterly installments on the first business day of each calendar quarter, subject to the non-employee Director's continued service in such role on such date, is as set forth below (directors are not to be paid a Chair and member-based fee for serving on the same Committee):

In addition, Option Accounting Rules prohibit some valuation techniques which may be useful in certain circumstances.

On February 23, 2017, following the recommendation of our Corporate Governance Committee, our Board voted to adopt non-employee Director Stock Ownership guidelines effective at our Annual Meeting on May 1, 2017 under which non-employee Directors are to hold shares of Company common stock at least equal in value to three times (3x) the annual cash retainer for Board service (the "Director Ownership Guideline").  Non-employee Directors are to achieve this level of ownership on or before the fifth anniversary of the later of (i) the date such Director became a member of the Company's Board and (ii) May 1, 2017. 
For purposes of Heska's stock ownership guidelines, a non-employee Director's stock ownership shall include all shares of Heska's common stock owned outright by the Director and by his or her immediate family members (spouse and dependent children), and any shares held in trust for the benefit of the Director and/or his or her immediate family members.  Shares of common stock issued upon exercise of stock options and vested restricted common stock shall be included, but unvested restricted common stock and unexercised stock options shall be excluded from the calculation of stock ownership.
Compliance with these deadlines will be determined on an annual basis by the Corporate Governance Committee based on information provided by the Secretary. As the Company's current cash retainer for non-employee Directors is $40,000, the Director Ownership Guideline is at least $120,000 in shares of Heska Common Stock.

 PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON
PROPOSAL NO. 1
AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER AND BYLAWS TO DECLASSIFY 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
After careful consideration, in March 2019, our Board voted unanimously to approve, and to recommend that our stockholders approve at the Annual Meeting, an amendment to our Charter and Bylaws to reclassify first into two classes, and then declassify fully, the Board, with the effect that the Board will be fully declassified at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020. This will allow our stockholders beginning next year to vote on the election of our entire board of directors each year, rather than on a staggered basis as with our current classified board structure. 
In order to effect the orderly and incremental transition to a fully declassified Board in 2020 from the current three class Board, the Board is recommending the Board first be divided into two classes at this Annual Meeting, designated Class I and Class II, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of each of the Class I directors expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2020, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. The initial term of office of each of the Class II directors shall be set to expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall be elected and shall qualify or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. The successor or successors of the directors who, immediately prior to the Annual Meeting, were members of Class I shall be elected to Class I; the directors who, immediately prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting, were members of Class II of the Board shall become members of Class I (resulting in there being three Class I directors); and the three directors who, immediately prior to the Annual Meeting, were members of Class III shall become members of Class II, with a term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
In furtherance of the foregoing and in connection with the Board's approval of this proposal, each of our Class II directors created by the approval of this proposal and whose term is not set to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders has tendered his or her resignation, contingent upon stockholder approval of this Proposal No. 1 at the 2019 Annual Meeting, effective as of immediately prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to allow for the early commencement of the fully declassified Board. If our stockholders do not approve this Proposal 1, our Board will remain classified in three classes, the contingent resignations will be ineffective, and our stockholders will instead be asked to elect the one Class I director at the 2019 Annual Meeting for a three year term ending in 2022.
Current Classified Board Structure
Immediately prior to the election of directors at the Annual Meeting, the Board was divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of directors of one class expiring at each annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. The term of office of directors: of Class I was set to expire at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders; of Class II was set to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders; and of Class III was set to expire at the annual meeting in 2021, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the number of directors equal to the number of directors of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting (or, if  less, the number of directors properly nominated and qualified for election) were to be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. 
Rationale for Ultimate Declassification
In determining whether to propose declassifying the Board to our stockholders, the Board considered the arguments in favor of and against continuation of the classified Board structure and determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to amend our Charter and Bylaws to declassify the Board.
The Board recognized that a classified board structure may offer several advantages, such as promoting board continuity and stability, encouraging directors to take a long-term perspective, and ensuring that a majority of the Board will always have prior experience with the Company, and that classified boards provide effective protection against unwanted takeovers and proxy contests as they make it difficult for a substantial stockholder to gain control of the board without the cooperation or approval of incumbent directors who are motivated to protect stockholder value, including in the face of an unsolicited takeover attempt.
The Board also recognized that a classified board structure may appear to reduce directors' accountability to stockholders, since such a structure does not enable stockholders to express a view on each director's performance by means of an annual vote, and that many institutional investors believe that the election of directors is the primary means for stockholders to influence corporate governance policies and to hold management accountable for implementing those policies.
Proposed Declassification of the Board
Declassification of the Board requires several changes to our Charter and Bylaws, all by a Two-thirds Supermajority vote of our stockholders. Specifically, Articles VI and VIII of our Charter, and Sections 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 8.2 of the Bylaws, must be amended to provide first for the reclassification of the Board from three classes to two and then to nullify altogether the provisions concerning a classified Board structure, as well as to delete the Two-thirds Supermajority voting requirement of the stockholders to eliminate the staggered classes of the Board, which higher voting requirement was included in the Charter and Bylaws to make it more difficult to eliminate the staggered Board structure and is therefore no longer necessary for that purpose. The text of the revised Articles of the Charter and Sections of the Bylaws are attached as Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively, to this proxy statement, with the proposed Bylaws deletions resulting from the proposed amendments indicated by strike-outs and proposed Bylaws additions resulting from the proposed amendments indicated by underlining. 
If approved by our stockholders, the amendments to our Charter will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (which would occur during the Annual Meeting and prior to consideration of the proposal to elect directors), and the Bylaws upon the effective time of the amendment to our Charter amendment. Our Board will then be classified into two classes until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which meeting it will be declassified immediately and automatically without any further action by any person, so that every director will stand for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and thereafter for a one-year term. Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a Two-thirds Supermajority. Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, this requires the affirmative vote of a minimum of 5,161,485 shares.
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the amendments to the Charter and Bylaws to first reclassify and then declassify the Board.  PROPOSAL NO. 2
ELECTION OF DIRECTOR
We are to elect one (1) Director at our 2019 Annual Meeting.  Mark F. Furlong is a continuing Director whose term is scheduled to expire at our 2019 Annual Meeting and who has been nominated by our Board, upon the recommendation of our Corporate Governance Committee, to stand for election to our Board at our 2019 Annual Meeting.
At the time of our Annual Meeting, our Board will be reduced from eight (8) members to six (6) members.  If Proposal No. 1, passes and our Board continues to consist of six (6) members, we will have two classes of Directors - one with a term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting and the other with a term expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting.  In this case, Mr. Furlong is to be elected to a term to end at the 2020 Annual Meeting and join Dr. Sveen and Mr. Wilson, whose terms are currently to end at the 2020 Annual Meeting as well.  If Proposal No. 1 does not pass, our current three class Board form will continue, Mr. Furlong is to be elected to a term ending at the 2022 Annual Meeting and our Board may decide to place one of our Board members with a term currently set to expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting into a Board class with Mr. Furlong so that our Board will consist of three classes of Directors with two (2) Directors in each class.
In either case, any Director to be elected at our 2019 Annual Meeting will continue to hold office until their respective successor is elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE STOCK PLAN 
 TO ADD A NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION LIMIT AND EXPAND THE TYPES OF AWARDS AVAILABLE FOR GRANT THEREUNDER
We currently maintain the Stock Plan (formerly known as the Heska Corporation 1997 Stock Incentive Plan) for the purpose of making equity compensation grants to employees, directors and consultants. The Stock Plan has served as an important part of our overall compensation program since its initial adoption, and continuing through several amendments and restatements. The Stock Plan, as proposed to be restated pursuant to this proposal (the "Restated Plan"), will allow the Compensation Committee to grant a wider variety of types of equity awards to participants and will impose a limit of $300,000 per calendar year on cash and equity compensation paid to each outside director of the Company.  On March 14, 2019, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board adopted, subject to the approval of our stockholders, the Restated Plan. The Restated Plan is intended to replace the Stock Plan. If stockholders do not approve the Restated Plan, then it will not be effective and no grants will be made under it. In such event, the Stock Plan will remain in effect. The following is only a summary of the Restated Plan, if approved, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to its full text, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix C.
In order to allow us the flexibility to make different types of equity compensation grants that serve as incentives to recruit and retain key employees, directors and consultants, and to continue aligning the interests of our employees, directors and consultants with stockholders, the Board unanimously recommends that the Restated Plan be approved by stockholders.
Background
Our Stock Plan was originally adopted by our Board and approved by our stockholders in 1997. It was amended and/or restated as of March 6, 2007, May 5, 2009, February 22, 2012, March 25, 2014, May 6, 2014, March 28, 2016, March 7, 2018, May 3, 2018 and December 19, 2018. The stated purpose of the Stock Plan is to promote the long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by: (a) encouraging employees, outside directors and consultants to focus on critical long-range objectives; (b) encouraging the attraction and retention of employees, outside directors and consultants with exceptional qualifications; and (c) linking employees, outside directors and consultants directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. The amendment and restatement of the Stock Plan that was adopted by our Board on December 19, 2018 effectuated certain non-material revisions thereto, including, among other things, (i) updating the name of the Stock Plan to the "Stock Incentive Plan", (ii) expanding the one-year minimum vesting requirement to apply to all awards granted under the Stock Plan, with certain exceptions, (iii) providing that any dividends declared on awards of restricted shares will be accumulated and paid at the time and to the extent that the underlying awards vest, and (iv) allowing for tax withholding of shares at up to the maximum statutory rate. 
The Restated Plan retains the purpose of the Stock Plan and does not increase the number of shares available for issuance pursuant to future awards. The Restated Plan is different from the Stock Plan in some respects, however, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards of restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards, and other cash-based awards may now be granted under the Restated Plan, in addition to awards of options and restricted shares that were previously allowed under the Stock Plan (subject to the same per-participant annual limits that were in place under the Stock Plan); and 
• Cash and equity compensation paid to any outside director in one calendar year shall not exceed $300,000 per fiscal year in respect of his or her service as an outside director. 
[END TABLE]
 A summary of the material features of the Restated Plan appears below and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Restated Plan as set forth in Appendix C, which should be referred to for a complete description of its provisions.
Plan Highlights
Effective Date and Expiration
The Restated Plan will be effective as of May 2, 2019, if approved by stockholders. It has no predetermined expiration date, although incentive stock options may not be granted after the tenth anniversary of its most recent amendment or restatement. Awards made prior to any termination or suspension of the Restated Plan may extend beyond that date.
Administration
The Restated Plan will be administered by a committee of two or more Directors appointed by the Board (the "Committee"). The Committee has full authority to interpret the Restated Plan and to establish rules for its administration.
Eligibility for Awards
Awards can be made to any employee, outside Director or consultant. Only employees, however, are eligible to receive incentive stock options.
Determination of Amount and Form of Award
The amount of individual awards will be determined by the Committee, subject to the limitations of the Restated Plan. In determining the amount and form of an award, consideration will be given to the functions and responsibilities of the employee, his or her potential contributions to our success, and other factors deemed relevant by the Committee.
Shares Subject to the Plan; Other Limitations on Awards
Subject to certain adjustments, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to new awards under the Restated Plan is 2,885,130, as approved by stockholders pursuant to the May 3, 2018 amendment and restatement of the Stock Plan. Shares subject to an award under the Restated Plan which is canceled or terminated without having been exercised or paid will again be available for future awards. On the other hand, in no event will shares of our stock that are (i) tendered in payment of the exercise price of options or (ii) withheld from any award to satisfy a participant's tax withholding obligations be available for future awards under the Restated Plan.
Awards made under the Restated Plan are subject to the following per-participant annual limits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A maximum of 50,000 shares underlying options and/or stock appreciation rights in the aggregate may be issued in one year to any one participant (except that shares underlying options and/or stock appreciation rights granted to a new employee in the first fiscal year of their employment may be a maximum of 100,000 shares in the aggregate). 
• A maximum of 45,000 shares (or, in the case of a new employee in the first fiscal year of their employment, a maximum of 75,000 shares) may be awarded in the form of restricted shares,  
[END TABLE]
 restricted stock units, and/or other stock-based awards in the aggregate in one year to any one participant.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No more than $500,000 may be paid in the form of other cash-based awards to any single participant per calendar year. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Restated Plan limits compensation paid to each outside director, including cash fees and incentive equity awards (based on their grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes), to a maximum of $300,000 per fiscal year in respect of his or her service as an outside director.
Minimum Vesting Provision
Awards under the Restated Plan are subject to a minimum vesting period of one year. However, the Committee may (a) permit acceleration of vesting of an award in the event of a participant's death, disability, or retirement, or the occurrence of a change in control, and (b) grant awards covering 5% or fewer of the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the Restated Plan without regard to the minimum vesting requirement. Awards made to outside directors will be deemed to satisfy the minimum vesting requirement to the extent that they vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next regular annual meeting of the Company's stockholders that is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting.
Types of Awards
Awards of stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, other stock-based awards and other cash-based awards may be granted to eligible individuals under the Restated Plan.
Stock Options
The Committee may grant non-qualified options and options qualifying as "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Committee generally determines the terms and conditions of all options granted, subject to the terms of the Restated Plan. Options vest in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Committee, and the Committee may impose additional conditions, restrictions or terms on the vesting of any option, including the full or partial attainment of performance goals. The term of an incentive stock option cannot exceed ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of an option must be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our stock on the date of grant.
The option price may be paid in cash, with shares of our stock, through a broker-assisted "cashless" exercise procedure, a "net exercise" or with such other acceptable form of valid consideration and method of payment as may be determined by the Committee.
Stock options may not be repriced. This means that the Committee may not take any of the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amend a stock option to reduce its option price; 
• Cancel a stock option in exchange for cash, other awards or the re-grant of a new stock option with a lower option price than the original option price of the cancelled stock option; or 
• Take any other action (whether in the form of an amendment, cancellation or replacement grant) that has the effect of repricing a stock option without stockholder approval. 
[END TABLE]
 Restricted Shares
The Committee may also issue or transfer shares of our Common Stock to a participant under a restricted share award. Restricted share awards are subject to certain conditions and restrictions during a specific period of time, such as the participant remaining in the employment of the Company and/or the attainment by the Company of certain pre-established performance goals, as discussed below. The shares cannot be transferred by the participant prior to the lapse of the restriction period or the attainment of the performance goals. In the case of restricted shares, the participant is entitled to vote the shares during the restriction period. Unless otherwise provided in the award agreement, restricted shares will receive dividends; provided, that to the extent restricted shares are entitled to receive dividends, any dividends declared will be accumulated and paid at the time (and to the extent) that the underlying restricted shares vest. 
Restricted Stock Units
A restricted stock unit is a right to receive shares of common stock (or their cash equivalent) at a specified date in the future, subject to forfeiture of such right.  If the restricted stock unit has not been forfeited, then on the date specified in the restricted stock unit grant, the Company must deliver to the holder of the restricted stock unit unrestricted shares of common stock (or their cash equivalent). In the Committee's discretion, holders of restricted stock units may be entitled to receive dividend equivalents; provided, that to the extent restricted stock units are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, any dividend equivalents with respect to dividends declared will be accumulated and paid at the time (and to the extent) that the underlying restricted stock units vest. A participant holding restricted stock units will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to the restricted stock units until all restrictions have been lifted and the shares have been issued to the participant.
Stock Appreciation Rights
A stock appreciation right entitles the holder to receive an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock appreciation right (which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date), multiplied by the number of shares of common stock subject to the stock appreciation right (as determined by the Committee).
Other Stock-Based Awards
Under the Restated Plan, we may grant or sell to any participant unrestricted common stock, dividend equivalent rights and/or other awards denominated in or valued by reference to our common stock.  A dividend equivalent is a right to receive payments, based on dividends with respect to shares of our common stock. 
Other Cash-Based Awards 
We may grant cash awards under the Restated Plan, including cash awards as a bonus or based upon the attainment of certain performance goals.
Performance Goals
The Restated Plan contains provisions intended to enable compensation paid to those executive officers whose compensation is subject to the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code to qualify as "performance-based compensation" that will be fully deductible by us for grants made prior to November 2, 2017. Prior to recent U.S. federal income tax law changes and prior to or during the beginning of a  performance period, the Committee could establish performance goals for the Company and our various operating units which could qualify the award subject to those goals for deductibility without regard to the limitations of Section 162(m). The goals were to be comprised of specified levels of one or more of the following performance criteria as the Committee deemed appropriate:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1) operating income or operating profit (including but not limited to operating income and any affiliated growth measure); 
2) net earnings or net income (before or after taxes, including but not limited to deferred taxes, and any affiliated growth measure); 
3) basic or diluted earnings per share (before or after taxes, including but not limited to deferred taxes, and any affiliated growth measure); 
4) revenues (including but not limited to revenue, gross revenue, net revenue, and any affiliated growth measure); 
5) gross profit or gross profit growth; 
6) return on assets, capital, invested capital, equity or sales; 
7) cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and cash flow return on capital); 
8) earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization (including but not limited to changes in this measure); 
9) improvements or changes in capital structure (including but not limited to debt balances or debt issuance); 
10) budget management; 
11) productivity targets; 
12) economic value added or other value added measurements; 
13) share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total shareholder return); 
14) expense targets; 
15) margins (including but not limited to gross or operating margins); 
16) efficiency measurements (including but not limited to availability measurements, call wait times, call, meeting, shipping or other volume measurements, turnaround times and error rates); 
17) working capital targets (including but not limited to items reported on the Company's balance sheet and time-based or similar measures such as days inventory, days receivable and days payable); 
18) equity or market value measures; 
19) enterprise or adjusted market value measures; 
20) safety record; 
21) completion of business acquisition, divestment or expansion; 
22) book value or changes in book value (including but not limited to tangible book value and net asset measures); 
23) assets or changes in assets; 
24) cash position or changes in cash position; 
25) employee retention or recruiting measures; 
26) milestones related to filings with government entities or related approvals (including but not limited to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which may require stockholder approval); 
27) changes in location or the opening or closing of facilities; 
28) contract or other development of relationship with identified suppliers, distributors or other business partners; and 
29) new product development (including but not limited to third-party collaborations or contracts, and with milestones that may include but are not limited to contract execution, proof of concept, regulatory approval, product launch and targets such as unit volume and revenue following product launch). 
[END TABLE]
 In addition, for any awards not intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may establish goals based on other performance criteria as it deems appropriate. The Committee may disregard or offset the effect of certain extraordinary items, such as restructuring charges, gains or losses on the disposition of a business, changes in tax or accounting rules or the effects of a merger or acquisition, in determining the attainment of performance goals. Awards may also be payable when our performance, as measured by one or more of the above criteria, as compared to peer companies meets or exceeds an objective criterion established by the Committee.
Adjustments on Capitalization
In the event of a subdivision of our outstanding shares of Common Stock, a declaration of a dividend payable in shares, a declaration of a dividend payable in a form other than shares in an amount that has a material effect on the price of shares, a combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, such that an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be made available under the Restated Plan, then the Committee may make appropriate adjustments in the maximum aggregate number and kind of shares issuable under the Restated Plan, and to any one participant, and the number and kind of shares and the price per share subject to outstanding awards.
Change in Control
For purposes of the Restated Plan, "change in control" means any of the following events:
(a)The consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity of any other corporate reorganization, if more than 50% of the combined voting power of the continuing or surviving entity's securities outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or other reorganization is owned by persons who were not stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such merger, consolidation, or other reorganization; or
(b)The consummation of a sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or
(c)A majority of the members of the Board are replaced during any eighteen-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board before the date of appointment or election; or
(d)Solely with respect to awards granted in 2018 or later, any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than (i) the Company, (ii) a subsidiary thereof, (iii) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary thereof, or (iv) any company owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than fifty percent of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities.
An award agreement may provide that an award will vest, become exercisable, and/or become unrestricted in the event of a change in control. Amendment
The Board can amend, suspend or terminate the Restated Plan. An amendment of the Restated Plan will be subject to our stockholders' approval only to the extent required by law.
Certain Federal Tax Aspects
The following paragraphs are a summary of the Company's understanding of the general federal income tax consequences to U.S. taxpayers and the Company of awards granted under the Restated Plan. Tax consequences for any particular individual may be different.
Incentive Stock Options
No taxable income is reportable when an incentive stock option is granted or exercised (except for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, in which case taxable income is the same as for nonstatutory stock options). If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares more than two years after the grant date and more than one year after the exercise date, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss. If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares before the end of the two- or one-year holding periods described above, he or she generally will have ordinary income at the time of the sale equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise price of the option if the sale price exceeds the exercise price.
Nonstatutory Stock Options
No taxable income is reportable when a nonstatutory stock option, which also may be referred to as a nonqualified stock option, is granted to a participant. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on the exercise date) of the shares purchased over the exercise price of the option. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss.
Restricted Shares
A participant will not have taxable income upon grant unless he or she elects to be taxed at that time. Instead, he or she will recognize ordinary income at the time of vesting equal to the fair market value (on the vesting date) of the vested shares.
Stock Appreciation Rights
A participant who is granted a stock appreciation right will not recognize ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon receipt or vesting of the stock appreciation right.  At the time of exercise, however, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the value of any cash received and the fair market value on the date of exercise of any shares received.  The participant's tax basis in any shares received will be the fair market value on the date of exercise and, if the shares are later sold or exchanged, then the difference between the amount received upon such sale or exchange and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise will generally be taxable as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss (if the stock is a capital asset of the participant) depending upon the length of time such shares were held by the participant. Restricted Stock Units
A participant who is granted a restricted stock unit will not recognize ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the receipt of the restricted stock unit, but rather will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares (or value of the cash paid) at the time of settlement.
Other Stock-Based and Other Cash-Based Awards
In the case of other stock-based and other cash-based awards, depending on the form of the award, a participant generally will not be taxed upon the grant of such an award, but, rather, will generally recognize ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes when such an award vests or otherwise is free of restrictions.  
Tax Effect for the Company
The Company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the Restated Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option or a stock appreciation right or the settlement of a restricted stock unit).
Special rules limit the deductibility of compensation paid to certain of our executive officers. Under Section 162(m) of the Code, the annual compensation paid to certain executive officers will be deductible only to the extent that it does not exceed $1,000,000. Prior to recent tax law changes, however, the Company could preserve the deductibility of certain compensation in excess of $1,000,000 if the conditions of Section 162(m) are met. These conditions included stockholder approval of the Stock Plan, setting limits on the number of awards that any individual may receive and, for awards other than certain stock options, establishing performance criteria that must be met before the award actually will vest or be paid. While no assurance regarding the deductibility of awards granted prior to these tax law changes can be made based on ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s exemption from the deduction limit, the Restated Plan as designed is intended to fall within the transition relief under Section 162(m) to permit the Company to receive a federal income tax deduction in connection with awards granted prior to these tax law changes to the extent that they qualified as performance-based for purposes of satisfying the conditions of Section 162(m).
New Plan Benefits
The number of awards that our Named Executive Officers, directors, other Executive Officers and other employees may receive under the Restated Plan will be determined in the discretion of the Committee in the future, and the Committee has not made any determination to make future grants to any persons under the Restated Plan as of the date of this proxy statement. It is not possible to determine the future benefits that will be received by any participants under the Restated Plan, or the benefits that would have been received by such participants if the Restated Plan had been in effect in the year ended December 31, 2018.  Vote Required; Recommendation of our Board of Directors
The Restated Plan is to be approved by the affirmative vote of a Quorum Majority. Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date, this requires the affirmative vote of 3,871,112 shares. If the Restated Plan is not approved, the Stock Plan will remain as-is with no changes.
Our Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Restated Plan. PROPOSAL NO.  4
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Our Board is submitting the appointment of Plante & Moran PLLC ("Plante Moran") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for stockholder ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Effective October 1, 2018, EKS&H LLLP ("EKS&H"), the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company ratified by our stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting, combined with Plante Moran. As a result EKS&H resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, and the Audit Committee contemporaneously with the resignation appointed Plante Moran as the successor to EKS&H. EKS&H served as our independent registered public accounting firm since March 31, 2006. A representative of Plante Moran is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if the representative desires to do so. Such representative also is expected to be available to answer questions at the meeting.
Vote Required; Recommendation of our Board of Directors
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of Plante Moran as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise. Our Board, however, is submitting the appointment of Plante Moran to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance practice. If a Voting Majority is FOR this proposal, we will consider the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 complete. If stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Plante Moran as our independent registered public accounting firm, although our Audit Committee maintains the full discretion to continue to retain Plante Moran in such a circumstance. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
Our Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of Plante Moran as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PROPOSAL NO.  5
OFFER OF APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IN A 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank"), enacted in July 2010, and Section 14A of the Exchange Act require that we provide you with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. We are asking for your advisory vote on the following resolution (the "say-on-pay" resolution):
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the subsection of this proxy statement titled "Executive Compensation", including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.
We did not offer a stockholder vote on executive compensation prior to such a vote being required under Dodd-Frank as we believe this topic is best handled by a deliberative compensation committee with access to detailed information on each executive's individual performance, which it may not be appropriate or in a company's best interest to disclose, and accordingly, a general vote on the subject is unlikely to provide valuable insight to such a committee in its role of determining appropriate compensation for a given executive officer, or executive officers as a group.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, an identical resolution received 99.1% of votes "for" and 0.9% "against" of the shares voted "for" or "against".
Compensation Philosophy
As described in greater detail under the heading "Executive Compensation", we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. The ultimate objective of our executive compensation program is to attract, retain and reward executives who will enhance the value and profitability of the Company and increase stockholder value. The Compensation Committee strives to provide competitive compensation opportunities with the ultimate amount of compensation received tied significantly to short-term and long-term Company performance. Inherent in our approach is the philosophy that compensation can align behavior and actions with stockholder interests, attract and retain stronger executives and thus create value for stockholders over time.
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, but rather relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
Vote Required; Recommendation of our Board of Directors
If a Voting Majority is FOR this proposal, we will consider the non-binding, advisory approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers to have occurred. If such a Voting Majority is not obtained, our Compensation Committee may consider changes to some of our executive compensation policies, although our Compensation Committee maintains its full discretion in this area as this is an advisory vote only.
Our Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive officers in fiscal year 2018. PROPOSAL NO. 6
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Dodd-Frank and Section 14A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 require that we seek your advisory vote this year on how often the Company should hold a say-on-pay vote. By law, stockholders in public companies like Heska are to have an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory executive compensation vote at least every six years. 
By law, as a stockholder you will be able to specify one of four choices for the frequency of the vote on the say-on-pay proposal as follows: (i) one year; (ii) two years; (iii) three years; or (iv) abstain. This vote is advisory only and therefore will not be binding on our Board or the Company. Our Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than any preference indicated by our stockholders. 
The Company is to announce its decision on the frequency of advisory executive compensation stockholder votes in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC no later than 150 days after the Annual Meeting. Our Board may change the vote frequency of advisory executive compensation stockholder votes at its discretion. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of our Board of Directors 
Our Board may consider this advisory vote in making its decision on the frequency of advisory executive compensation votes, although our Board maintains its full discretion in this area as this is an advisory vote only. 
Our Board unanimously recommends a vote for ONE year as the frequency for holding a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers as our Board believes this has come to be regarded as a corporate governance best practice.  POTENTIAL VOTE NO. 7
ADVISORY VOTE WITH RESPECT TO 
DISCRETIONARY VOTING BY PROXYHOLDERS
Other than the items of business described in Proposal Nos. 1 through 6, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Since our initial public offering in 1997, only items that were described in the proxy materials made available to stockholders prior to the corresponding Annual Meeting or Special Meeting were resolved by a vote of our stockholders at such meetings. While we have taken steps to ensure this remains the case, it is possible other business may properly come before our Annual Meeting, via the efforts of a stockholder or otherwise. In such a circumstance, our proxyholders - Eleanor F. Baker, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Catherine I. Grassman, our Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, and Christopher D. Sveen, our Vice President, General Counsel - will have the discretion to vote shares for which we have been granted a proxy as they may determine. As a matter of good corporate governance practice, we are asking stockholders to submit an advisory vote for the proxyholders' consideration in such a circumstance. We will interpret a "for" vote as an indication that the stockholder's preference is that the proxyholders exercise their voting discretion in a manner they determine to be in the best interest of the Company's stockholders, an "against" vote as an indication that the stockholder's preference is that the proxyholders exercise their voting discretion against any proposal brought to a vote as outlined above, including a proposal the proxyholders otherwise believe to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, and an "abstain" or non-vote as an indication that the stockholder does not wish to express a preference regarding such a circumstance. It is important to note this is an advisory vote only, and that while the proxyholders may consider the advisory vote in such a circumstance, the proxyholders retain full discretion to vote as they may determine regardless of any outcome of the advisory vote.
Recommendation of our Board of Directors
Our Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR your preference being that the proxyholders exercise their voting discretion in a manner they determine to be in the best interest of the Company's stockholders, if other business properly comes before the Annual Meeting and you are voting by proxy. OTHER MATTERS
The Board knows of no other business to be transacted at the Annual Meeting.
OTHER INFORMATION
"Householding" of Proxy Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding", potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Heska and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent to such householding. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you hold registered shares. You can notify us by sending a written request to Investor Relations, Heska Corporation, 3760 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Loveland, Colorado 80538. 
Proxy Solicitor
You may contact our proxy solicitor, Morrow Sodali LLC ("Morrow Sodali"), for a copy of the proxy materials. Morrow Sodali's address is 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902. Stockholders may call Morrow Sodali at 1-800-662-5200 and brokers and banks may call Morrow Sodali at 1-203-658-9400. We undertake to promptly deliver a separate copy of the proxy materials upon receiving your written or oral request.

Kevin S. Wilson is Heska Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and President as well as a member of Heska Corporation's Board. Heska Corporation's employment agreement with Mr. Wilson acknowledges that Mr. Wilson has business interests in Cuattro, LLC, Cuattro Software, LLC and Cuattro Medical, LLC which may require a portion of his time, resources and attention in his working hours.
Mr. Wilson is the spouse of Shawna M. Wilson ("Mrs. Wilson"). Mr. Wilson, Mrs. Wilson and trusts for the benefit of their children and family own a 100% interest in Cuattro, LLC as well as a majority interest in Cuattro Medical, LLC. Cuattro, LLC owns a 100% interest in Cuattro Software, LLC.
On February 24, 2013, we acquired a 54.6% interest (the "Acquisition") in Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC, which was, subsequently, renamed Heska Imaging US, LLC. This transaction marked our entry into the veterinary imaging market. The remaining minority position (45.4%) in Heska Imaging US, LLC was subject to purchase by Heska Corporation under certain performance-based puts (the "US Imaging Puts"). The Amended and Restated Master License Agreement and the Supply Agreement between Heska Imagining US,  LLC and Cuattro, LLC were negotiated at arms length as part of the Acquisition.  Immediately following the Acquisition and continuing until immediately prior to the US Imaging Purchase (as defined below), Shawna M. Wilson, Clint Roth, DVM, Steven M. Asakowicz, Rodney A. Lippincott, Kevin S. Wilson and Cuattro, LLC (collectively, the "Imaging Minority") owned approximately 29.75%, 8.39%, 4.09%, 3.07%, 0.05% and 0.05% of Heska Imaging US, LLC, respectively.  Steven M. Asakowicz serves as Executive Vice President, Companion Animal Health Sales for Heska Corporation, Rodney A. Lippincott serves as Executive Vice President, Companion Animal Health Sales for Heska Corporation.   Mr. Wilson was also a founder of Cuattro Veterinary USA, LLC. 
On May 31, 2016, Heska Corporation closed the transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Cuattro Veterinary, LLC ("Cuattro International"), Cuattro International Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), Kevin S. Wilson, and all of the members of Cuattro International (the "Members"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date the Merger Sub was merged with and into Cuattro International, with Cuattro International surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, as of the Closing Date, Cuattro International was renamed Heska Imaging International, LLC, and the Company's interest in both Heska Imaging International, LLC ("International Imaging") and Heska Imaging US, LLC was transferred to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Heska Imaging Global, LLC ("Global Imaging").  Heska Imaging US, LLC, Cuattro, LLC and Global Imaging agreed the Amended and Restated Master License Agreement and the Supply Agreement with Cuattro, LLC would be assigned from Heska Imaging US, LLC to Global Imaging so that the licensing and supply agreements would be between Cuattro, LLC and Global Imaging after the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement closed.  Mr. Wilson was a founder of Cuattro International and Cuattro, LLC and, including equity held by members of his family and trust for the benefit of his children and family, owned a majority interest in Cuattro International prior to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement closing.
The required performance criteria for the US Imaging Puts were met based on 2016 financial performance, Heska Corporation considered notice given on March 3, 2017 that the US Imaging Puts were being exercised in full and on May 31, 2017, Heska Corporation delivered $13.8 million in cash to purchase the remaining 45.4% in Heska Imaging US, LLC it did not already own (the "US Imaging Purchase").
On April 3, 2017, and in accordance with the terms of its Operating Agreement, Heska Imaging US, LLC distributed $2.1 million based on financial results through December 31, 2016, including $1.0 million to the Imaging Minority. In January 2018, there was a distribution of $277 thousand to the owners of Heska Imaging US, LLC immediately prior to the US Imaging Purchase, including $126 thousand to the Imaging Minority, based on the financial results of Heska Imaging US, LLC through May 31, 2017.
On June 1, 2017, the Company consolidated (the "Consolidation") its assets and liabilities in Heska Imaging US, LLC and Heska Imaging International, LLC into Heska Imaging Global, LLC, which was re-named Heska Imaging, LLC ("Heska Imaging").
On November 26, 2018, Heska Imaging, entered into a Purchase Agreement for Certain Assets (the "Purchase Agreement") with Cuattro, LLC, pursuant to which Heska Imaging will purchase certain software and related assets (the "Software Assets") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8.2 million and terminate its existing license of the Software Assets and certain related obligations as described below (the "2018 Imaging Transactions"). The aggregate purchase price consists of $2.75 million in cash and 54,763 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share.  The Purchase Agreement includes a covenant of each party to use reasonable commercial efforts and negotiate in good faith with its hardware vendors to make hardware components available to both parties on the same terms.  The 2018 Imaging Transactions closed on December 21, 2018. As part of the 2018 Imaging Transactions, Heska Imaging acquired ownership of the Software Assets that were subject to the Amended and Restated License Agreement and the Amended and Restated License Agreement was terminated.  Cuattro, LLC will retain ownership of software used in markets other than the veterinary market that is similar or identical to the Software Assets.  The Supply Agreement was also terminated as part of the 2018 Imaging Transactions, although Cuattro, LLC is obligated, without further compensation, to assist Heska Imaging to implement data migration to a third-party image hosting platform and to continue to provide hosting, DICOM nodes, data migration and other cloud-related services to Heska Imaging through December 31, 2019, which may be extended as necessary to complete the transition to a third-party provider if such transition has not occurred for any reason other than failure of Heska Imaging to cooperate with the transition.  While the remaining Cuattro, LLC obligations were originally negotiated at arm's length as part of the Acquisition, Mr. Wilson has an interest in these obligations and any time and resources devoted to monitoring, overseeing and fulfilling the obligations and commitments of both Cuattro, LLC and Heska Imaging in this transition may prevent us from deploying resources on more productive matters.
We have entered into consulting agreements related to the Software Assets with two software consultants who we are aware also are to perform consulting services for Cuattro, LLC.  We hired two employees following the 2018 Imaging Transactions who previously worked exclusively for Cuattro, LLC and who we are aware continue to offer to work part-time for Cuattro, LLC when not working for the Company.
Cuattro, LLC charged Heska Imaging US, LLC $3.6 million from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016 and charged Heska Imaging Global, LLC $10.9 million from June 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, primarily related to digital imaging products, for which there is an underlying supply contract with minimum purchase obligations, software and services as well as other operating expenses provided for under a license agreement and a supply agreement, respectfully; Heska Corporation charged Heska Imaging US, LLC $5.3 million during 2016, primarily related to sales and other administrative expenses; and Heska Corporation net charged Cuattro, LLC $189 thousand during 2016, primarily related to facility usage and other services.  In general, the entities above have charged one another the lower of cost or market in the absence of a formal contract.
Cuattro, LLC charged Heska Imaging $17.7 million during 2017 primarily related to digital imaging products, for which there is an underlying supply contract with minimum purchase obligations, software and services as well as other operating expenses provided for under a license agreement and a supply agreement, respectfully. Heska Corporation charged Heska Imaging US, LLC $2.9 million during the five months ended May 31, 2017, primarily related to sales expenses.

In, general, the entities above have charged one another the lower of cost or market in the absence of a formal contract.
At December 31, 2018, Heska Imagining owed Cuattro LLC $226 thousand.
Since January 1, 2016, the Company has not been a participant in any transaction with a related person other than described above and the indemnification agreements described below. Indemnification agreements with officers and directors
Our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and Executive Officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Further, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and Executive Officers. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Executive Compensation Objective and Philosophy
The Compensation Committee of Heska Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") administers our executive compensation program and establishes the salaries of our Executive Officers. The ultimate objective of our executive compensation program is to attract, retain and reward executives who will enhance the value and profitability of Heska Corporation and increase stockholder value. The Compensation Committee strives to provide competitive compensation opportunities with the ultimate amount of compensation received tied significantly to short-term and long-term Company performance. Inherent in our approach is the philosophy that compensation can align behavior and actions with stockholder interests, attract and retain stronger executives and thus create value for stockholders over time. The Compensation Committee's goal in executive compensation is to design and administer programs that best serve these ends.
What is Heska's Executive Compensation Program Designed to Reward?
The Compensation Committee develops our executive compensation programs to reward Executive Officers for their contribution to Heska's financial performance and to recognize individual initiative, leadership, achievement and other contributions. We believe an effective compensation program will reward executives for working well collectively as well as for strong individual performance.
What are the Elements of Heska's Executive Compensation?
Our compensation program is designed to reward four interlocking aspects of executive performance:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual financial performance: rewarded primarily through the awards paid under the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"); 
• Individual contribution: rewarded primarily through the setting of base salary and annual MIP targets; 
• Long-term gains in stockholder value: rewarded primarily through the equity incentive program; and 
• Continued service to the Company; rewarded primarily through base salary, equity award requirements and vesting and competitive benefits levels. 
[END TABLE]
Why Does Heska Choose to Pay Each Element of Executive Compensation?
Base salary. Base salaries are set on an annual or other periodic basis and designed to reflect competitive market salaries for each position. They are also used in determining the basis for bonus targets in our MIP discussed below.
Performance-based incentive compensation. This form of compensation is based on the achievement of predetermined financial, project, research or other designated objectives. This form of compensation is paid to reward near-term performance (i.e., no longer than the coming year) and encourage Executive Officers to optimize immediate opportunities. In recent years, an MIP has been offered to Executive Officers and other managers to provide a performance-based incentive.
Long-term equity compensation. This form of compensation is designed to encourage the achievement of superior financial results over an extended period of time and align the interests of stockholders and  Executive Officers. It is intended to ensure that Executive Officers make thoughtful decisions about the Company's future and long-term prospects.
Other benefits, compensation or arrangements. Other than broad-based programs open to all employees, such as participation in our 401(k) program and employee stock purchase plan, this category tends to be used rarely. All of our Executive Officers have employment agreements. An Executive Officer's extraordinary performance or participation in an unanticipated endeavor may occasionally trigger such an award in this category.
Determination of Compensation Elements
In reviewing the compensation of our Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee reviews the nature and scope of each Executive Officer's responsibilities as well as his or her effectiveness in that role and in supporting the Company's long-term goals. Heska's Board of Directors (the "Board") formally evaluates the Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO"). Our CEO communicates his view of the performance of other Executive Officers to the Compensation Committee and makes recommendations regarding salary, incentive-based performance compensation and long-term compensation grants for the Compensation Committee's consideration. The Company has a review system it uses to evaluate its employees, including Executive Officers, which the CEO may consider, potentially along with other information, such as third-party interviews of Company employees who interact with the Company's Executive Officers. In the past several years, the Officer responsible for Human Resources has compiled and/or presented data discussed below for the Compensation Committee's consideration of the different compensation elements.
The Compensation Committee has considered it appropriate, and in the best interests of Heska's stockholders, to endeavor to set our overall Executive Officer compensation near the mid-point of the range of companies in the comparison group it reviewed ("Comparable Companies"). The Compensation Committee also reviews the relative mix of compensation paid by Comparable Companies for use as a guideline. In compensation matters, the Compensation Committee reviews relevant information and makes a case-by-case determination relying on its collective judgment and experience.
The Compensation Committee engaged an outside compensation consultant (the "Consultant") in 2016 and 2017 regarding Executive Compensation matters. The Compensation Committee viewed the Consultant as an advisor only, and the Compensation Committee retained the discretion to implement or not implement the Consultant's suggestions. The Consultant did not advise the Compensation Committee regarding Executive Compensation matters in 2015, 2018 or 2019. Other than services related to Director Compensation in 2015 and 2017 and Executive Compensation in 2016 and 2017, the Consultant did not provide any other services to the Company in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019.
The Compensation Committee considers compensation data from companies in medical, biotechnology and general industry groups that have similar revenues, veterinary focus and/or are in a similar stage of development to Heska. In 2015 and 2016, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation data for the following companies as part of its review of Executive Compensation: Abaxis, Inc., Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., Array Biopharma Inc., Axogen, Inc., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc., Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cutera, Inc., DepoMed, Inc., Derma Sciences, Inc., DURECT Corporation, Enzo Biochem, Inc., Harvard Bioscience, Inc., Lannett Company, Inc., Natural Alternatives International, Inc., Pernix Therapeutic Holdings, Inc., POZEN Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Psychemedics Corporation, Quidel Corporation, Retractable Technologies, Inc., Synergetics USA, Inc., Tearlab Corp., Unilife Corporation, XOMA Corporation and Zogenix, Inc.  In 2017, the Compensation Committee received advice from the Consultant regarding the group of companies to review in relation to Executive Compensation and reviewed compensation data for the following companies as part of its review of Executive Compensation:  Abaxis, Inc., ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., Atrion Corporation, Endologix, Inc., Enzo Biochem, Inc., Landauer, Inc., Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Natera, Inc., National Research Corporation, OraSure Technologies, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Quidel Corporation, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., STAAR Surgical Company, Tactile Systems Technology, Inc., Teligent, Inc. and Veracyte, Inc. as well as aggregate data from a Radford Life Sciences Custom Report created with data from the following companies: Abaxis, Inc., Aduro Biotech, Inc., Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., Coherus Biosciences, Inc., CryoLife, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., Intersect ENT, Inc., Mannkind Corporation, Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Nanostring Technologies, Inc., Natera, Inc., OraSure Technologies, Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Quidel Corporation, Repligen Corporation, Retrophin, Inc., SciClone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., STAAR Surgical Company, Surmodics, Inc., Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Veracyte, Inc. and Xencor, Inc.  In 2018, the Company reviewed compensation data for the following companies as part of its review of Executive Compensation: Abaxis, Inc., ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., Atrion Corporation, Endologix, Inc., Enzo Biochem, Inc., Landauer, Inc., Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Natera, Inc., National Research Corporation, OraSure Technologies, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Quidel Corporation, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., STAAR Surgical Company, Tactile Systems Technology, Inc., Teligent, Inc. and Veracyte, Inc. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Compensation Committee also reviewed Radford Life Sciences Executive Survey data and Mountain States Employees Council Survey data.
Base Salary. The Compensation Committee reviews each Executive Officer's base salary annually. When reviewing base salaries, the Compensation Committee considers compensation data from companies in medical, biotechnology and general industry groups that have similar revenues, veterinary focus and/or are in a similar stage of development to Heska. Consideration is also given to prior performance, relevant experience, level of responsibility and skills, and abilities of each Executive Officer. Similar positions are grouped to ensure both internal equity and external equity. The Compensation Committee reviews relevant information and makes a case-by-case determination relying on its collective judgment and experience.
In March 2014, Mr. Wilson became our Chief Executive Officer and President at an annual salary of $275,000 and the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Wilson (the "Wilson Agreement"). See "March 2014 Wilson Employment Agreement" and "Transition of Chief Executive Officer Role" below for more detail.
Following approval by the Compensation Committee in September 2015, who reviewed proposed responsibilities and market compensation data, Mr. Napolitano's annual salary was increased to $350,000 concurrent with his being named the Company's Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2015.
In September 2016, the Compensation Committee reviewed Executive Officer performance, responsibilities, and market compensation data with Mr. Wilson and, effective October 1, 2016, and increased Dr. Wisnewski's annual salary to $300,000.
In December 2017, Ms. Grassman was appointed as the Company's Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller at an annual salary of $210,000.
In December 2017, based in part on Mr. Wilson's strong performance as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, the Compensation Committee authorized and approved an increased annual salary for Mr. Wilson to $600,000.
In April 2018, Mr. Aroesty was appointed as the Company's Executive Vice President, International Diagnostics at an annual salary of $300,000. Performance-Based Incentive Compensation. The Company first adopted an MIP in 1999 to provide incentives to our Executive Officers, other managers and key employees to meet and exceed certain predetermined annual goals. Target annual incentives and specific performance criteria are established each year by the Compensation Committee, with the actual payout based on the extent to which the specified performance criteria are met. We believe this approach provides a strong incentive for our management to achieve the stated annual goals. In May 2014, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Management Incentive Plan Master Document (the "Master Document"). A goal of the Master Document is self-funding status for the MIP in any given year. A given year's MIP can be implemented by the Compensation Committee agreeing on four parameters: 1) the Category Percentages - the percent of salary, based on job category, that determines an individual's targeted bonus compensation, 2) the Plan Allocation - a guideline in determining the MIP Payout to an individual, such as the relative weighting of companywide and individual performance, 3) the Key Parameters on which the MIP Payouts are to be based and 4) the Payout Structure by which MIP funding is accrued. Typically there has been a cap on the MIP of approximately at least 150% of target payout to all employees, although this was not required in any given year and the cap for 2016, 2017 and 2018 was 200% of target payout for each MIP Participant. Each individual has a MIP Payout "target" and this is intended as a guideline. Our CEO will generally make recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding MIP Payouts to other MIP Plan participants; all awards under the MIP Plan are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. All Executive Officers are eligible to participate in our 2019 MIP. We do not believe our compensation policy for our Executive Officers, our sales force or our other employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. We generally pay our sales force commissions based on sales volume and other targets, which we believe is typical in our industry.
In March 2016, after reviewing and discussing with Management the Company's 2015 financial results and 2016 budget, the Compensation Committee agreed to adopt the 2016 MIP with the following parameters:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Mr. Wilson was ineligible to participate in the 2016 MIP due to his employment agreement. Participating Executive Officers were given the option to elect to receive up to 50% of MIP Payouts in Common Stock in lieu of cash under the 2016 MIP (the percentage chosen by a given participating Executive Officer in a given MIP year to be referred to as the "Chosen Percentage" in such MIP year for such Executive Officer) and such Executive Officers were given a corresponding performance-based restricted stock grant related to the Company's Management Incentive Plan (each, an "MIP Grant" and a "20XX MIP Grant" when referring specifically to a given year's MIP, so an MIP Grant issued in relation to the 2016 MIP would be referred to as a "2016 MIP Grant").  Up to 100% of each 2016 MIP Grant was to vest at the time payments  were made under the 2016 MIP. The number of shares vesting under a given 2016 MIP Grant was to be determined by multiplying the Chosen Percentage by the holder's MIP Payout, dividing the result by the stock price at the time of the 2016 MIP Grant and rounding to the nearest whole share, with any shares underlying the 2016 MIP Grant that do not vest at this time being forfeited.  The balance of the MIP Payout for the individual in the previous sentence is to be in cash after deducting the value of the vested portion of the 2016 MIP Grant as calculated in the previous sentence.  For example, if a participating Executive Officer had a Chosen Percentage of 45% and the stock price at the time of the MIP Grant was $22.50 and subsequently was awarded an MIP Payout of $100,000, he or she would vest up to 2,000 shares of the affiliated MIP Grant (45% times $100,000 divided by $22.50), and assuming the affiliated MIP Grant was 2,000 shares he or she would receive $55,000 in cash ($100,000 minus 2,000 shares times $22.50).  In the table named "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" below, we list potential cash payouts under the 2016 MIP to the Named Executive Officers, under "Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" and 2016 MIP Grants that had the potential to vest under "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards".  These amounts are adjusted for the Chosen Percentages for each Named Executive Officer.  Under the 2016 MIP, Chosen Percentages were 45% and 40% for Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski, respectively.  In March 2016, each of Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski received a 2016 MIP Grant of 2,500 shares. 
At a Compensation Committee meeting in February 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's financial performance, which translated to the maximum Incentive Pool under the 2016 MIP and discussed Mr. Wilson's recommendations regarding total MIP Payouts with Mr. Wilson. The cash MIP Payouts to MIP-eligible Named Executive Officers are listed in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation Table" below for Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski.  2,500 shares from Mr. Napolitano's 2016 MIP Grant were vested. 2,177 shares from Dr. Wisnewski's 2016 MIP Grant were vested, 691 of which were withheld for tax.  The vested value of the 2016 MIP Grants as calculated above is included in "Stock Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation Table" below for Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski.
In May 2017, after reviewing and discussing with Management the Company's 2016 financial results and 2017 budget, the Compensation Committee agreed to adopt the 2017 MIP with the following parameters:

Mr. Wilson was ineligible to participate in the 2017 MIP due to his employment agreement. In June 2017, each of Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski received a 2017 MIP Grant of 1,180 and 1,011, respectively.  Under the 2017 MIP, Chosen Percentages were 40% and 40% for Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski, respectively.  At a Compensation Committee meeting in February 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's financial performance for 2017 and determined that the Company's financial performance did not meet the minimum threshold for MIP Payouts under the 2017 MIP.  Accordingly, no MIP Payouts were made and all 2017 MIP Grant shares were forfeited.
During 2017, the Compensation Committee discussed the concept of lowering the MIP Category Percentages for Executive Officers in future MIPs as part of an overall compensation approach which would emphasize large equity grants to a greater degree than in the past.
In July 2018, after reviewing and discussing with Management the Company's 2017 financial results, 2018 budget and the publicly communicated outlook from May 2018 for the Company's financial performance, the Compensation Committee agreed to adopt the 2018 MIP with the following parameters:

[END TABLE]
As the Compensation Committee believed the 2018 MIP PMTI targets were unlikely to be achieved all "Threshold" and "Target" 2018 MIP Payouts are listed at zero in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table that follows. All "Maximum" MIP Payouts are listed at the maximum of 200% of Incentive Target for a given participant. 
At a Compensation Committee meeting in February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company's financial performance did not meet the minimum threshold for MIP Payouts under the 2018 MIP.  Accordingly, no 2018 MIP Payouts were made.
Long-Term Equity Compensation. Historically, we have used stock options to provide long-term equity compensation to our Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the number and terms of options, or other forms of long-term equity compensation, to be granted to Executive Officers, taking into account such factors as individual and Company performance, policies regarding cash compensation and practices of Comparable Companies. Options granted to Executive Officers have exercise prices equal to fair market value (closing price) at the time of grant and expire within ten years from the time of grant. Any vesting ceases and the vested portion of options must be exercised within a certain period should an Executive Officer leave Heska's service (subject to any rights to partial acceleration of vesting upon termination without cause under employment agreements). Accordingly, option grants will provide a return to an Executive Officer only if said Executive Officer continues to work for the benefit of the Company and only if Heska's market price per share appreciates over the option term. We believe that these provisions help both to retain qualified employees and to motivate them to achieve long-term increases in stock value, providing continuing benefits to the Company and its stockholders beyond those in the year of grant. Stock options grants generally have had 4-year monthly vesting when granted, although the Compensation Committee issued stock options with 3-year annual vesting in March 2018 and could issue stock options with these or other vesting provisions in the future.  In addition to the MIP Grants under the Company's 2016 MIP and  2017 MIP discussed above, the Compensation Committee issued performance-based restricted stock in 2014, 2015 and 2018, as discussed below.  It is possible the Compensation Committee may use some or all of performance-based restricted stock, time-based restricted stock, stock options or some other form of long-term equity compensation in the future.
In March 2014, Mr. Wilson was awarded restricted stock awards under the Wilson Agreement. In May 2014, Mr. Wilson was awarded a further restricted stock award under the Wilson Agreement following approval of the Company's stockholders. See "March 2014 Wilson Employment Agreement" below for more detail.
In March 2015, following a discussion with Mr. Wilson at its February 2015 meeting regarding Mr. Wilson's preferred approach to the compensation of management and key individuals, the Compensation Committee approved performance-based restricted stock grants (the "Performance Grants") to certain Executive Officers. The Performance Grants are to cliff vest three years following issuance, subject to the Company achieving $7 million in Operating Cash Flow, as defined in the underlying restricted stock grant agreement, in at least one of 2015, 2016 or 2017. The Company met the Operating Cash Flow requirement based on its 2015 financial results. The Company generally targeted Performance Grants to the Executive Officer's annual salary. Mr. Napolitano received 12,863 shares in Performance Grants and Dr. Wisnewski received 10,892 shares in Performance Grants.
In December 2016, the Compensation Committee discussed long-term compensation for Executive Officers and other key Company managers with Mr. Wilson and awarded option grants for Executive Officers, including Mr. Napolitano and Dr. Wisnewski.
Throughout 2017, the Compensation Committee discussed the concept of moving away from its historical policy of annual long-term compensation grants to an approach entailing less frequent, but larger grants of long-term compensation awards to the Company's Executive Officers.
In December 2017, based in part on Mr. Wilson's strong performance as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President as well as to more closely align Mr. Wilson's interests with those of our stockholders, Mr. Wilson was issued a performance-based restricted stock grant of 45,000 shares. 16,875 of the performance-based restricted shares were subject to possible market price vesting through December 1, 2024 as follows: 5,625 of such shares shall vest each time the Company's stock price per share first averages over a 20 trading day period $110 per share, $125 per share and $150 per share. If any of such vesting events is achieved prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, then such vesting event will be deemed to be the first anniversary of the grant date. 28,125 of the performance-based restricted shares were subject to possible vesting in three installments of 9,375 shares each if the Company achieves targeted operating income results of $25 million, $30 million and $35 million through the Company's fiscal years ending December 31, 2024, with vesting to occur no earlier than the later of (i) three years following the achievement of such target or (ii) the date occurring in calendar year 2022 that the Company's independent registered public accountants issue their financial report on the Company's financial statements for the preceding fiscal year. Any of the shares that vest are subject to forfeiture generally if within 3 years thereafter the Company issues a restatement of its audited financial statements. The restricted shares may also vest in connection with a change in control of the company, upon the occurrence of Mr. Wilson's death or defined disability, or termination of employment by the Company without cause or by Mr. Wilson for good reason.
In March 2018 the Compensation Committee authorized the issuance of (i)  9,165, 9,165, and 3,849 restricted common shares (the "Revenue-based Shares") to Mr. Napolitano, Dr. Wisnewski and Ms. Grassman, respectively, in four approximately equal tranches for each individual with vesting tied to minimum service conditions described below and the achievement of four respective annual revenue targets increasing in $30 million increments from $170 million to $260 million, (ii) 7,813, 7,813, and 3,280 restricted  common shares (the "Income-based Shares") to Mr. Napolitano, Dr. Wisnewski and Ms. Grassman, respectively, in three approximately equal tranches for each individual with vesting tied to the achievement of three respective annual operating income targets increasing in $5 million increments from $25 million to $35 million, (iii) 12,000, 3,334, 3,334, and 1,401 restricted common shares (the "S&P-based Shares") to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Napolitano, Dr. Wisnewski and Ms. Grassman, respectively, with vesting tied to the Company's common stock closing price outperforming the S&P 500 Index over either a two or four year time period, and (iv) 4,688, 4,688, and 1,970 restricted common shares (the "Stock Price-based Shares") to Mr. Napolitano, Dr. Wisnewski and Ms. Grassman, respectively, in three approximately equal tranches for each individual with vesting tied to minimum service conditions described below and the achievement of three respective 20-day average closing common stock price levels with increases of approximately 25%, 45% and 75% as compared to the Company's stock price level at the time of grant.  Approximately 75% of the Revenue-based Shares have a minimum service condition through the date in each fiscal year that the Company's independent registered public accountants issue their financial report on the Company's financial statements for the preceding fiscal year (the "Reporting Date") in 2022 and approximately 25% of the Revenue-based Shares have a minimum service condition through the Reporting Date in 2021.  Approximately one-third of the Stock Price-based Shares have a minimum service condition through March 7, 2020, March 7, 2021 and March 7, 2022, respectively.  S&P-based Shares are to be forfeited if not achieved at the end of the specified time period, Revenue-based Shares and Income-based Shares are to be forfeited if the corresponding performance condition is not met by the Reporting Date in 2025 and Stock Price-based Shares are to be forfeited if the corresponding stock price is not achieved by March 31, 2025.  The Compensation Committee also authorized the issuance of stock options with 30,000, 20,000, 20,000 and 10,000 underlying shares to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Napolitano, Dr. Wisnewski and Ms. Grassman.  The stock options are to vest in three approximately equal annual tranches or at the time of change in control, and were issued with an exercise price per share of $69.77. The shares of common stock subject to the foregoing awards are also subject to a possible three year claw back by the Company after vesting in the event of a financial statement restatement, and the restricted stock awards are subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a termination without cause or a resignation for good reason or in the event of a change in control of the company, in each case as described in the restricted stock grant agreement.
In July 2018 the Compensation Committee authorized the issuance of (i)  9,165 restricted common shares (the "Aroesty Revenue-based Shares") in four approximately equal tranches with vesting tied to minimum service conditions described below and the achievement of four respective annual revenue targets increasing in $30 million increments from $170 million to $260 million, (ii) 7,813 restricted common shares (the "Aroesty Income-based Shares") in three approximately equal tranches for each individual with vesting tied to the achievement of three respective annual operating income targets increasing in $5 million increments from $25 million to $35 million, (iii)  3,334 restricted common shares (the "Aroesty S&P-based Shares") with vesting tied to the Company's common stock closing price outperforming the S&P 500 Index over either a two or four year time period, and (iv) 4,688 restricted common shares (the "Aroesty Stock Price-based Shares") in three approximately equal tranches for each individual with vesting tied to minimum service conditions described below and the achievement of three respective 20-day average closing common stock price levels with increases of approximately 25%, 45% and 75% as compared to the Company's stock price level at the time of grant.  Approximately 75% of the Aroesty Revenue-based Shares have a minimum service condition through the Reporting Date in 2022 and approximately 25% of the Aroesty Revenue-based Shares have a minimum service condition through the Reporting Date in 2021.  Approximately one-third of the Aroesty Stock Price-based Shares have a minimum service condition through July 25, 2020, July 25, 2021 and July 25, 2022, respectively.  Aroesty S&P-based Shares are to be forfeited if not achieved at the end of the specified time period, Aroesty Revenue-based Shares and Aroesty Income-based Shares are to be forfeited if the corresponding performance condition is not met by the Reporting Date in 2025 and Aroesty Stock Price-based Shares are to be forfeited if the corresponding stock price is not achieved by March 31, 2025.  The Compensation Committee also authorized the issuance of stock options with 20,000 underlying shares to Mr.  Aroesty.  The stock options are to vest in three approximately equal annual tranches or at the time of change in control, and were issued with an exercise price per share of $106.67.  The shares of common stock subject to the foregoing awards are also subject to a possible three year claw back by the Company after vesting in the event of a financial statement restatement, and the restricted stock awards are subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a termination without cause or a resignation for good reason or in the event of a change in control of the company, in each case as described in the restricted stock grant agreement.
Other Benefits, Compensation or Arrangements
"All Other Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation Table" below represent matching funds received by each of our Named Executive Officers under our 401(k) plan, which is open to all employees, as well as life insurance and short-term and long-term disability premiums. We have historically provided a 25% match of 401(k) contributions (up to a certain maximum), which was increased to a 40% match of 401(k) contributions (up to a certain maximum) as of April 1, 2018.
All of our Named Executive Officers had employment contracts in 2016, 2017 and 2018, except Ms. Grassman and Mr. Aroesty. Ms. Grassman joined the Company in January 2017, became an Executive Officer in December 2017 and was offered an employment agreement in March 2018.  Mr. Aroesty joined the Company and signed an employment agreement at the time he joined the Company in April 2018.  These employment agreements entitle Named Executive Officers to payments based on salary, continuing medical benefits for a given period and immediate vesting of unvested options in noted circumstances. Payments based on salary are typically paid bi-monthly consistent with Company policy. The Compensation Committee believes these terms are common, are in line with the experience of the Compensation Committee for executives at other companies and are intended to provide Executive Officers with additional resources to seek a comparable job, which is unlikely to be a rapid process given the level of employment, in these certain circumstances, such as an acquisition. These employment contracts are intended to provide the Named Executive Officers with protections appropriate for, and in line with, those received by comparable executives at companies similar to Heska. Periodically, we review these agreements versus market benchmarks.  Such a review was conducted in September 2016.
On March 7, 2018, the Company agreed to offer an employment agreement to Catherine Grassman, the Company's Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, and the Company's principal financial and accounting officer for Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") reporting purposes. Under the employment agreement, Ms. Grassman's initial employment term is thirty-six months from the effective date, with automatic one year extensions after the original expiration date in the absence of notice to the contrary at least 120 days prior to expiration.  Ms. Grassman is to continue to serve as the Company's Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller at an annual base salary of $210,000, and she is eligible to participate in the Company's MIP. Ms. Grassman is to devote all of her full attention, skills, time and business efforts to the Company.  Under the agreement, she is also eligible to participate in the benefits offered to other executives of the Company.  Should Ms. Grassman resign for good reason or be terminated without cause (other than in connection with a change of control) or be terminated due to Ms. Grassman's death or disability, she is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal to 6 months of base salary.  Should Ms. Grassman resign for good reason or be terminated without cause in connection with a change of control of the Company, she is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal to 12 months of base salary. The agreement also provides for a 12 month noncompetition and a 24 month non-solicitation period following termination of employment.
Effective April 23, 2018, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Jason D. Aroesty, the Company's Executive Vice President, International Diagnostics. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Aroesty's initial employment term is thirty-six months from the effective date, with automatic one year  extensions after the original expiration date in the absence of notice to the contrary at least 120 days prior to expiration.  Mr. Aroesty is to continue to serve as the Company's Executive Vice President, International Diagnostics at an annual base salary of $300,000, and he is eligible to participate in the Company's MIP. Mr. Aroesty is to devote all of his full attention, skills, time and business efforts to the Company.  Under the agreement, he is also eligible to participate in the benefits offered to other executives of the Company.  Should Mr. Aroesty resign for good reason or be terminated without cause (other than in connection with a change of control) or be terminated due to Mr. Aroesty's death or disability on or before April 23, 2021, he is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal to 12 months of base salary.  Should Mr. Aroesty resign for good reason or be terminated without cause (other than in connection with a change of control) or be terminated due to Mr. Aroesty's death or disability after April 23, 2021, he is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal to 6 months of base salary.  Should Mr. Aroesty resign for good reason or be terminated without cause in connection with a change of control of the Company, he is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal to 12 months of base salary. The agreement also provides for a 12 month noncompetition and a 24 month non-solicitation period following termination of employment.
Transition of Chief Executive Officer Role
Our Board of Directors has expressed a high degree of interest in focusing the Company on growth opportunities for several years. Cognizant of this and following discussions with Mr. Wilson, Robert B. Grieve, Ph.D., the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from May 2000 to March 2014, raised the possibility with other Board members in November 2013 of Mr. Wilson becoming Chief Executive Officer, with Dr. Grieve acting in an Executive Chairman role for a transition period. Dr. Grieve noted the very positive commercial impact Mr. Wilson had made on the Company in less than a year as President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as Mr. Wilson's experience in generating strong growth at his prior company, Sound Technologies, Inc. Following discussions and diligence by the Compensation Committee as well as individual Board members, the Board discussed this notion in depth at an in-person Board meeting on February 19, 2014 and decided to proceed. On February 19, 2014, the Compensation Committee met and unanimously agreed to offer Mr. Wilson a new employment agreement with certain economic terms. The Compensation Committee authorized Mr. Gordon to negotiate with Mr. Wilson to finalize this agreement. Mr. Gordon was ultimately able to obtain agreement with Mr. Wilson, which was approved by the Compensation Committee in a telephonic meeting on March 25, 2014. Mr. Wilson and William A. Aylesworth, the Company's Lead Director from May 2010 to May 2014, signed the resulting agreement one day later, on March 26, 2014.
March 2014 Wilson Employment Agreement
The Compensation Committee hired the Consultant to advise on Mr. Wilson's compensation as Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Wilson expressed a strong preference for upfront restricted stock grants in lieu of other forms of compensation. The Consultant advised a majority of such compensation be subject to vesting based on performance. Members of the Board and the Compensation Committee ultimately felt that this would best align Mr. Wilson's interest with stockholder interest.
Mr. Wilson agreed to an employment agreement with the following components on March 26, 2014. The term of Mr. Wilson's employment agreement was to expire on March 26, 2018. Beginning immediately following the filing of the Company's Form 10-K, which occurred on March 31, 2014, Mr. Wilson began to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company for an annual base salary of $275,000. Our Board agreed to nominate Mr. Wilson for election to a three-year term as director at the 2014 Annual Meeting as well as for future election when Mr. Wilson's then existing term is set to expire. Mr. Wilson was eligible to participate in the Company's 2014 MIP based on service from January 1, 2014 to March 31, 2014 at a Category Percentage of 35% but not for service after becoming Chief Executive Officer, which translated to a  Category Percentage of less than 9% for full year 2014. Pursuant to the employment agreement, the Company granted Mr. Wilson 110,000 shares of restricted stock (the "Time Grant") which were to vest as follows, subject to the terms and conditions of the related award agreement: (i) 27,500 shares on the six month anniversary of the employment agreement on September 26, 2014 and (ii) 27,500 shares on each of March 26, 2015, March 26, 2016 and March 26, 2017. Other than in special circumstances, Mr. Wilson is not to receive periodic equity grants normally made to executives of the Company.
In addition, the Company's stockholders approved a 130,000 share restricted stock grant to Mr. Wilson (the "Contract Grant") at our 2014 Annual Meeting. The Contract Grant, subject to the terms and conditions of the related award agreement was to vest in ten (10) performance-based tranches - five of which were to be based on the market price of the Company's Common Stock reaching targeted thresholds based on a 90 trading day trailing average and five of which were to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the employment agreement, reaching certain targeted thresholds. Based on 2014 performance, Mr. Wilson vested all five tranches based on Adjusted EBITDA and one of five tranches based on the market price of the Company's Common Stock. The remaining four tranches based on the market price of the Company's Common Stock vested during 2015.
The issuance of shares to Mr. Wilson under the Wilson Agreement is the reason the "Stock Awards" column of the "Summary Compensation Table" below shows a zero value in 2016. The expensing of shares issued to Mr. Wilson under the Wilson Agreement is responsible for the annual decrease in "Stock Awards" column of the "Historical Compensation Table" below; the "Stock Awards" expense decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 as recognition related to fewer underlying award shares vested.
March 2018 Wilson Employment Agreement
On March 7, 2018, the Company agreed to a new employment agreement with Mr. Wilson, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, which superseded and terminated Mr. Wilson's existing employment agreement that was set to expire by its terms on March 26, 2018.  Under the new employment agreement, Mr. Wilson's employment term is to expire on December 31, 2021, he is to continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President at an annual base salary of $600,000, and the Board has agreed during the term of the agreement to nominate Mr. Wilson for election to the Board at each stockholder meeting when Mr. Wilson is up for election, which next such election is expected in 2020.  Mr. Wilson remains eligible to participate in the Company's MIP, or such other bonus programs as established by the Compensation Committee, at a target bonus of 20% of his base salary then in effect.  Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Wilson the 12,000 S&P-based Shares and the stock option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock discussed above and also agreed that at its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company was to propose for approval by its stockholders an additional 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be authorized for issuance under the Stock Plan (the "Share Increase") and the Company was to grant Mr. Wilson an additional 33,000 shares under certain performance-based and time-based service conditions if the Share Increase was approved by the Company's stockholders. The Share Increase was approved by the Company's stockholders in May 2018 and the Company granted Mr. Wilson 33,000 Revenue-based Shares (the "Conditional Grant"), which shares shall vest in tranches of 8,250 shares and are subject to the other terms and conditions of the Revenue-based Shares as described above. Mr. Wilson is to devote all of his business efforts and time as well as other such attention, skills, time and business efforts to the Company as are necessary to responsibly act as Chief Executive Officer and President; provided, however, that Mr. Wilson may perform part-time management activities for Cuattro, LLC, Cuattro Software, LLC, and Cuattro Medical, LLC, as long as such services do not adversely affect Mr. Wilson's obligations to the Company.  Under the agreement, Mr. Wilson is also eligible to participate in the benefit programs, such as the Company's 401(k) plan, generally available to the Company's executive officers.  Should Mr. Wilson resign for good reason or be terminated without cause (other than in connection with a change of control) or be terminated due to Mr. Wilson's death or disability, (i) he is to be entitled to a payment of an amount equal  to 12 months of base salary, and (ii) all vesting of outstanding equity awards will terminate immediately, provided that if his employment is terminated (A) at least one year following a grant date due to death or disability, any remaining unvested equity awards will vest, and (B) if within one year after any such termination without cause or for good reason the Company achieves one or more of the performance criteria for vesting, then any equity awards that would otherwise have vested by virtue of the achievement shall be deemed to vest on the applicable vesting date as if such employment had not terminated.  Should Mr. Wilson resign for good reason or be terminated without cause in connection with a change of control of the Company, he is to be entitled to (i) a payment of an amount equal to 12 months of base salary, and (ii) the vesting of all then unvested equity awards.  As described above, the shares of common stock subject to the equity awards issued pursuant to the employment agreement are also subject to a possible three year claw back by the Company after vesting in the event of a financial statement restatement.  The agreement also provides for a 12 month noncompetition and non-solicitation period following termination of employment.
Compensation Tax Deductibility
The Compensation Committee is also sensitive to, and tries to optimize, tax implications. It is our policy generally to qualify compensation paid to Executive Officers for deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code when possible. The Master Document was designed to qualify compensation paid to Executive Officers for deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code based on the laws in place at the time of its adoption. However, the Compensation Committee reserves the discretion to pay compensation to its Executive Officers that may not be tax deductible.
In summary, as Heska Corporation continues to evolve, Heska's Executive Compensation is evolving. The Compensation Committee endeavors to find the proper level and balance of base salary, performance-based incentive compensation, long-term equity incentive compensation and other forms of compensation. Historical and Summary Compensation Tables

March 26, 2019 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
Our Compensation Committee consists of non-employee Directors only. No interlocking relationship existed during 2018 between our Executive Officers, members of our Board of Directors or members of our Compensation Committee, and the Executive Officers, members of the Board of Directors or members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of any other company. 
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
Under Dodd-Frank and Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose certain information related to the ratio of compensation to our Chief Executive Officer and our other employees (the "Ratio Disclosure").  We calculated the median total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for all of our employees as of December 31, 2018, excluding the employees of our Swiss and Australian subsidiary, who represented less than 5% of our total employees, as well as our Chief Executive Officer, in the manner described in the "Summary Compensation Table" above.  Using this data, we determined the Ratio Disclosure median employee (the "Median Employee") total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 to be $52,834, as follows: "Salary" of $50,922, "All Other Compensation" of $1,912 and all other columns in the "Summary Compensation Table" with a value of zero.  The Ratio Disclosure for total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer is $4,754,252 as further described in our "Summary Compensation Table" above.  The Ratio Disclosure ratio of total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Median Employee to that of our Chief Executive Officer was 1:90.2.  We also calculated total compensation in the manner described in the "Historical Compensation Table" above for the Median Employee and determined total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Median Employee to be $52,834, as follows: "Salary" of $50,922, "All Other Compensation" of $1,912 and all other columns in the "Historical Compensation Table" above with a value of zero.  Using the same approach, total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer is $1,933,053 as further described in our "Historical Compensation Table" above.  Using the approach described in our "Historical Compensation Table" above, the ratio of total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 for our Median Employee to that of our Chief Executive Officer was 1:36.7.
Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Effective December 19, 2018, following the recommendation of our Corporate Governance Committee, our Board voted to adopt Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers. Under the guidelines,  Chief Executive Officer is to hold a number of shares of common stock at least equal in value to five times (5x) the Officer's Base Salary. Under the guidelines, the other Executive Officers are to hold a number of shares of common stock at least equal in value to one and a half times (1.5x) their Base Salary. Officers have three (3) years from the later date of (i) their respective hire dates and (ii) December 19, 2018 to achieve these ownership guidelines. Until an officer achieves the target guideline, he or she is expected to retain 50% of the net shares received upon exercise, vesting or earn-out from awards under our equity incentive plans. 
For purposes of Heska's stock ownership guidelines, an Executive Officer's stock ownership shall include all shares of Heska's common stock owned outright by the Executive Officer, shares owned jointly by Executive Officer and his or her spouse and any shares held in trust for the benefit of the Executive Officer and/or his or her family members.  Shares of unvested restricted common stock count toward compliance but other unvested awards do not.
All Executive Officers were in compliance with these guidelines at the time of adoption.
Compliance with these deadlines will be determined by the Compensation Committee. AUDITOR FEES AND SERVICES
Plante Moran became our independent registered public accounting firm during fiscal 2018. Plante Moran combined with EKS&H effective October 1, 2018. As a result EKS&H resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and on that same day our Audit Committee appointed Plante Moran as the successor independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. EKS&H had served as our independent registered public accounting firm since March 31, 2006. The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by Plante Moran and EKS&H to the Company for audit services rendered in connection with the consolidated financial statements and reports in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and for other services rendered during 2018 and 2017 on behalf of Heska and its subsidiaries, as well as all out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with these services which have been billed to Heska and its subsidiaries. Our Audit Committee has approved all of the below fees.

[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval Policy. Our Audit Committee pre-approves all auditing services and non-audit services not prohibited by law to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Audit Committee also pre-approves all associated fees, except for de minimis amounts for non-audit services, which are approved by our Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit.  The following "Report of our Audit Committee" and related disclosure shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating this proxy statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
REPORT OF OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE
The ultimate responsibility for good corporate governance rests with Heska Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board"), whose primary roles are oversight, counseling and direction to Heska Corporation's management in the best long-term interests of Heska Corporation ("Heska" or the "Company") and its stockholders. The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") has been established for the purpose of overseeing the accounting, internal controls and financial reporting processes of the Company and audits of Heska's financial statements.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on Heska's website at www.heska.com. As described more fully in its charter, the purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight and monitoring of Heska's financial reporting, internal controls and audit function. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of Heska's financial statements; accounting and financial reporting principles; internal controls; and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. The Audit Committee has hired an independent registered public accounting firm, who is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, direct, compensate, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace Heska's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee members are not functioning as professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent registered public accounting firm, nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent registered public accounting firm is "independent" under applicable rules. The Audit Committee serves a board-level oversight role, in which it provides advice, counsel and direction to management on the basis of the information it receives, discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business, financial and accounting matters. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage its own outside advisers, including experts in particular areas of accounting, as it determines appropriate, apart from counsel or advisers hired by management.
As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on October 4, 2018, EKS&H LLLP ("EKS&H"), our former independent registered public accounting firm, combined with Plante & Moran, PLLC ("Plante Moran") on October 1, 2018. As a result of this transaction, on October 1, 2018, EKS&H resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. On that same date, the Company's audit committee approved the engagement and appointment of Plante Moran to be the new independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.
Throughout the 2018 fiscal year, we met and held discussions with management and Plante Moran. Management represented to us that Heska's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and we have reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and Plante Moran. In Audit Committee meetings with Plante Moran, we discussed matters as required to be discussed by applicable auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the Commission, as amended or supplemented, covering required communications with audit committees. Our review included a discussion with management of the quality,  not merely the acceptability, of Heska's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments and the disclosure in Heska's consolidated financial statements.
We received from Plante Moran the written disclosures required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with Plante Moran its independence. In reliance on the reviews and discussions noted above, and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm, we recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and be filed with the Commission.
Overall audit fees and related expenses did not significantly increase in 2018 as compared to 2017.

CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT
TO THE
RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED,
OF
HESKA CORPORATION
Heska Corporation (the "Corporation"), a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), does hereby certify:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. This Certificate of Amendment to the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate"), has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 of the DGCL. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. This Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate amends Article VI of the Certificate by deleting the existing Article VI in its entirety and substituting therefore a new Article VI, to read in its entirety as follows: 
[END TABLE]
A. Board of Directors Structure.  
1. Board of Directors Matters. Immediately prior to the election of directors at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors was divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of directors of one class expiring at each annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Additional directorships resulting from an increase in number of directors were to be apportioned among the classes as equally as possible. The term of office of directors: of Class I was set to expire at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders; of Class II was set to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders; and of Class III was set to expire at the annual meeting in 2021, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the number of directors equal to the number of directors of the class whose term expires at the time of such meeting (or, if less, the number of directors properly nominated and qualified for election) were to be elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election.
2. Two Class Board of Directors Transition. Commencing with the election of directors at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, pursuant to Section 141(d) of the DGCL, the Board of Directors shall be divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of directors of one class expiring at each annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. Additional directorships resulting from an increase in number of directors shall be apportioned among the classes as equally as possible. The initial term of office of directors: of Class I shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 
A-1
2020; and of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall be elected and shall qualify or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity. The successors of the directors who, immediately prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, were members of Class I (whose terms were to expire at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders) shall be elected to Class I; the directors who, immediately prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, were members of Class II (whose terms were scheduled to expire at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders) shall become members of Class I; and the directors who, immediately prior to the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, were members of Class III (whose terms were scheduled to expire at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders) shall become members of Class II, with a term expiring at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders.
3. Elimination of Staggered Board of Directors.  Commencing at and from and after the election of directors at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors will cease to be classified as provided in Section 141(d) of the DGCL, the directors elected at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting thereafter shall be elected for a term of office expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and in all cases as to each director when such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified or upon such director's earlier resignation, removal from office, death or incapacity, and directors so elected may thereafter be removed by the stockholders of the corporation with or without cause pursuant to Section 141(k) of the DGCL.
B. Changes. During any period when the Board of Directors of this corporation is classified, the Board of Directors, by amendment to the corporation's bylaws, is expressly authorized to change the number of directors in any or all of the classes of directors without the consent of the stockholders.
C. Elections. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.
D. Vote Required to Amend or Repeal this Article VI. Until the election of directors at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend in any respect or repeal this Article VI. Effective automatically and contemporaneously with the election of directors at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, and without any further action by the Board of Directors, the stockholders of the corporation or any other person, this Section D of Article VI shall expire and be of no further force or effect and be deemed deleted in its entirety herefrom.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. This Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate amends Article VIII of the Certificate by deleting the last sentence of existing Article VIII in its entirety and substituting therefore a new last sentence of Article VIII, to read in its entirety as follows: 
[END TABLE]
A-2
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, until the election of directors at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, at which time this sentence shall automatically expire and be of no further force or effect and be deemed deleted in its entirety from this Article VIII (without any further action by the Board of Directors, the stockholders of the corporation or any other person), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the amendment or repeal of Article 3.1 of the Bylaws of the corporation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4. This Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate shall become effective at the time this Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

The Chair of the Board or, in his or her absence, the Lead Director, or in their absence, the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or, in their absence, such person as the Board may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as Chair of the meeting.  In the absence of the Secretary of the corporation, the Secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the Chair appoints.
The Chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her in order.

Except where otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented in proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders.  The stockholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to have less than a quorum if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.  At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  If, however, a quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat who are present in person or represented by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matters shall decide any matter brought before such meeting, unless the matter is one upon which by express 
B-4
provision of  law or of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter.  For purposes of determining whether shares are present and entitled to vote with respect to any particular subject matter, abstentions and non-votes with respect to such subject matter shall be treated as not present or entitled to vote on such subject matter, but shall be treated as present and entitled to vote for all other purposes.
2.12    Record Date for Stockholder Notice and Voting.  
(i)    For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, or entitled to exercise any right in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting nor more than sixty (60) days before any other action.  If the Board does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii)    For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing such record date is adopted by the Board.  If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required under Delaware law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by hand or certified mail, return receipt requested, to its principal executive office, or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.

2.13    Proxies.  To the extent permitted by law, any stockholder of record may appoint a person or persons to act as the stockholder's proxy or proxies at any stockholder meeting for the purpose of representing and voting the stockholders' shares.  The stockholder may make this appointment by any means the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware specifically authorizes, and by any other means the Secretary of the corporation may permit.  A validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by the person executing it, before the vote pursuant to that proxy, by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy; or (ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of that proxy is received by the corporation before the vote pursuant to that proxy is counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of three years from the date of the proxy, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.

In connection with any annual meeting, the Chair of the Board (or such other person presiding at such meeting in accordance with these Bylaws) shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

HESKA CORPORATION
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
Most Recently Amended and Restated Effective May 2, 2019
ARTICLE 1.
INTRODUCTION.
The Heska Corporation 1997 Stock Incentive Plan was originally adopted by the Board effective March 15, 1997 (the "Original Plan"). The Original Plan was subsequently amended and/or restated as of March 6, 2007, May 5, 2009, February 22, 2012, March 25, 2014, and May 6, 2014, March 28, 2016, March 7, 2018, May 3, 2018 and December 19, 2018 (the "Amended and Restated Plan"). The number of Common Shares available for issuance and subject to Awards under the Amended and Restated Plan was adjusted in connection with completion of the Company's 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split on December 30, 2010. The Board approved on March 14, 2019, and the Company's stockholders approved on May 2, 2019, the further amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Plan to, among other things, provide the Company with the ability to make Awards in the form of Restricted Stock Units, Stock Appreciation Rights, Other Cash-Based Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards, in addition to its existing ability to grant Awards of Restricted Shares and Options, and to add an annual limit on the cash and equity compensation that may be paid to each Outside Director of the Company.
The purpose of the Plan is to promote the long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by (a) encouraging Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants to focus on critical long-range objectives, (b) encouraging the attraction and retention of Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants with exceptional qualifications and (c) linking Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. The Plan seeks to achieve this purpose by providing for Awards in the form of Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, Options (which may constitute ISOs or NQOs), Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance-Based Awards, Other Cash-Based Awards, or Other Stock-Based Awards.
The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado (except its choice-of-law provisions).
ARTICLE 2.
ADMINISTRATION. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.1 COMMITTEE COMPOSITION. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall consist exclusively of two or more directors of the Company, who shall be appointed by the Board. In addition, the composition of the Committee shall satisfy: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Such requirements as the Securities and Exchange Commission may establish for administrators acting under plans intended to qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3 (or its successor) under the Exchange Act; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Such requirements as the Internal Revenue Service may establish for outside directors acting under plans intended to qualify for exemption under section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code. 
[END TABLE]
The Board may also appoint one or more separate committees of the Board, each composed of one or more directors of the Company who need not satisfy the foregoing requirements, who may administer the Plan with respect to Employees and Consultants who are not considered officers or directors of 
C-4
the Company under section 16 of the Exchange Act, may grant Awards under the Plan to such Employees and Consultants and may determine all terms of such Awards.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.2 COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Committee shall (a) select the Employees, Outside Directors and Consultants who are to receive Awards under the Plan, (b) determine the type, number, vesting requirements and other features and conditions of such Awards, (c) interpret the Plan and (d) make all other decisions relating to the operation of the Plan. The Committee may adopt such rules or guidelines as it deems appropriate to implement the Plan. The Committee may amend or modify any outstanding Awards in any manner to the extent the Committee would have had the authority under the Plan initially to make such Awards as so amended or modified. The Committee's determinations under the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.3 INDEMNIFICATION. No member of the Board or the Committee, or any officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof acting on behalf of the Board or the Committee, shall be personally liable for any action, omission, determination, or interpretation taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Board or the Committee and each and any officer or employee of the Company and of any Subsidiary thereof acting on their behalf shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and the Company's by-laws and governing documents, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, omission, determination or interpretation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.4 BENEFICIARY DESIGNATIONS. If permitted by the Committee, a Participant under the Plan may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom any vested but unpaid Award shall be paid in the event of the Participant's death.  Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee.  In the absence of any such designation, any vested benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the Participant in the Company's qualified 401(k) savings plan, or if none, to the Participant's surviving spouse, or if none, to the Participant's estate. 
[END TABLE]
ARTICLE 3.
SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANTS. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.1 BASIC LIMITATION. Common Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner. The number of Common Shares stated in this Section 3.1 as available for the grant of Awards is subject to adjustment in accordance with Article 12. As of March 7, 2018, the aggregate number of Common Shares cumulatively authorized by the Company's stockholders for issuance as Awards under the Plan was 2,635,130. Of that total, as of March 7, 2018, Previously Issued Awards have been issued covering 2,578,093 Common Shares, leaving 57,037 Common Shares for the issuance of Awards under the Plan. With the March 7, 2018 amendment and restatement of the Plan, the Company's Board and stockholders approved an increase of 250,000 in the aggregate number of Common Shares available for Awards under the Plan, to a new total of 2,885,130.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the additional 250,000 Common Shares the Company's Board and stockholders approved for Awards under the Plan as of March 7, 2018 will not be available for issuance with respect to any Award granted prior to November 2, 2017. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.2 ADDITIONAL SHARES.  Any Common Shares subject to an Award that is canceled, forfeited or expires prior to exercise or realization, either in full or in part, shall again become available for issuance under the Plan as Awards. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:  
[END TABLE]
C-5
Common Shares subject to an Award under the Plan shall not again be made available for issuance or delivery under the Plan if such Common Shares are (a) tendered in payment of an Option, or (b) delivered or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.3 MINIMUM VEESTING REQUIREMENTS.  Subject to the following sentence, Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to a minimum vesting period of one year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Committee may permit acceleration of vesting of an Award in the event of a Participant's death, Disability, or Retirement, or the occurrence of a Change in Control, and (ii) the Committee may grant Awards covering five percent (5%) or fewer of the total number of Common Shares authorized under the Plan without respect to the above-described minimum vesting requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Awards made to Outside Directors, the vesting of such Awards will be deemed to satisfy the one-year minimum vesting requirement to the extent that the Awards vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next regular annual meeting of the Company's stockholders that is at least fifty (50) weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.4 LIMITATION ON OUTSIDE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, compensation paid to an Outside Director, including cash fees and Awards under the Plan (based on the grant date Fair Market Value of such Awards for financial reporting purposes), shall not exceed $300,000 per fiscal year in respect of his or her service as an Outside Director. For the avoidance of doubt, compensation shall be counted toward this limit for the Board compensation year in which it is earned (and not when it is paid or settled in the event that it is deferred). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.5 PER-PARTICIPANT ANNUAL AWARD LIMITS. The Awards granted under the Plan to one Participant in a single fiscal year of the Company may not exceed the following limits: (i) 50,000 Common Shares subject to Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights in the aggregate, except that Options and/or Stock Appreciation Rights granted to a new Employee in the fiscal year of the Company in which his or her service as an Employee first commences shall not cover more than 100,000 Common Shares in the aggregate; (ii) 45,000 Common Shares granted in the form of Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and/or Other Stock-Based Awards in the aggregate, except a new Employee may receive grants of up to 75,000 Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and/or Other Stock-Based Awards in the aggregate in the fiscal year of the Company in which his or her service with the Company begins; and (iii) no more than $500,000 may be paid in the form of Other Cash-Based Awards to any single Participant per calendar year.  The limitations set forth in the preceding sentence shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Article 12.

The Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding Options or may accept the cancellation of outstanding Options (whether granted by the Company or by another issuer) in return for the grant of new Options for the same or a different number of Common Shares and at the same or a different exercise price; provided, that an extension of the term of an ISO shall be subject to limitations applicable to ISOs and provided further that any such extension may not exceed the maximum term of the Option.

C-8
to amend any outstanding Option without the Participant's consent if the Committee deems it necessary or advisable to comply with Code Section 409A).

5.9 PAYMENT FOR OPTION SHARES.  
(a) General Rule. The entire Exercise Price of Common Shares issued upon exercise of Options shall be payable in cash or cash equivalents at the time when such Common Shares are purchased, except as follows:

(b) Surrender of Stock. To the extent that this Section 5.9(b) is applicable, all or any part of the Exercise Price may be paid by surrendering Common Shares that are already owned by the Participant. Such Common Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date when the new Common Shares are purchased under the Plan. The Participant shall not surrender Common Shares in payment of the Exercise Price if such action could cause the Company to recognize additional compensation expense with respect to the Option for financial reporting purposes under GAAP accounting at the time of such proposed surrender. 
(c) Exercise/Sale. To the extent that this Section 5.9(c) is applicable, all or any part of the Exercise Price may be paid by delivering (on a form prescribed by the Company) an irrevocable direction to a securities broker approved by the Company to sell all or part of the Common Shares being purchased under the Plan and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company. 
(d) Other Forms of Payment. To the extent that this Section 5.9(d) is applicable, all or any part of the Exercise Price may be paid in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules, including, without limitation, pursuant to a net exercise.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.2 PAYMENT FOR AWARDS.    To the extent that an Award is granted in the form of newly issued Restricted Shares, the Award recipient, as a condition to the grant of such Award, shall be required to pay the Company in cash, cash equivalents or any other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Company, including but not limited to future services, an amount equal to the par value of such Restricted Shares. To the extent that an Award is granted in the form of Restricted Shares from the Company's treasury, no cash consideration shall be required of the Award recipients.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.3 VESTING CONDITIONS. Each Award of Restricted Shares shall be subject to vesting. Vesting shall occur, in full or in installments, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in the Award Agreement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
6.4 VOTING AND DIVIDEND RIGHTS. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the holder of Restricted Shares awarded under the Plan shall have the same voting, dividend and other rights as the Company's other stockholders; provided, that to the extent that a Restricted Share carries with it a right to receive dividends, any dividends declared shall be accumulated and paid at the time (and to the extent) that the Restricted Shares vest, but in no event later than two-and-a-half months following the end of the calendar year in which the vesting occurs.

The Committee, in its discretion, may grant dividend equivalents from the date of grant or only after a Restricted Stock Unit is vested. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that a Restricted Stock Unit carries with it rights to dividend equivalents, any dividend equivalents with respect to dividends declared shall be accumulated and paid at the time (and to the

[BEGIN TABLE]
7.4 SETTLEMENT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. Settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units shall be made to Participants in the form of Common Shares, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides for the payment of the Restricted Stock Units in cash (or partly in cash and partly in Common Shares) equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares that would otherwise be distributed to the Participant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Related Right may be granted for more Common Shares than are subject to the Option to which it relates and any Stock Appreciation Right must be granted with an Exercise Price not less than the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the date of grant. The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each Participant.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.1 IN GENERAL. For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Shares as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), the Committee, in its discretion, may make Restricted Shares subject to vesting based on the achievement of performance goals, in which case the Committee will specify in writing, by resolution or otherwise, the Participants eligible to receive such an Award (which may be expressed in terms of a class of individuals) and the performance goals applicable to such Awards within 90 days after the commencement of the period to which the performance goals relate, or such earlier time as required to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code. No such Award shall be payable unless the Committee certifies in writing, by resolution or otherwise, that the performance goals applicable to the Award were satisfied.

FUTURE OF THE PLAN. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
16.2 PERFORMANCE AWARDS.

[END TABLE]
ARTICLE 17.
CODE SECTION 409A. 
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under the Plan comply with Code Section 409A to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and be administered to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the "short-term deferral period" as defined in Code Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Code Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided upon a "separation from service" to a Participant who is a "specified employee" shall be paid on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following the Participant's separation from service (or upon the Participant's death, if earlier).
