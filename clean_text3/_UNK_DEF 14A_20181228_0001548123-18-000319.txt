You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of stockholders of Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc. on Friday, December 28, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Mountain Time, at the SpringHill Suites by Marriott, located at 12111 South State Street, Draper, Utah 84020.
The matters expected to be acted upon at the meeting are described in detail in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement.  We have also enclosed a copy of the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 which includes audited financial statements and certain other information.
It is important that you use this opportunity to take part in the affairs of Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc. by voting on the business to come before this meeting.  
WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING, PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN, DATE AND RETURN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY CARD PROMPTLY 
IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE.
Returning the proxy does not deprive you of your right to attend the meeting and vote your shares in person.
In light of the upcoming stockholders meeting I would like to share some of my thoughts about the past year and the Company's vision for the future.
During 2018 we have focused our marketing efforts on a number of larger domestic and international companies that have applications which have the potential to greatly increase the volume of sensors we are currently manufacturing.  As of the date of this report, the Company had at least sixteen global commercial partners covering a variety of different products.  In coordination with its partners, the Company introduced at least eight new products.  Management believes this growth in sales channels will allow the Company to grow at an increasingly accelerated rate over the next several quarters.  
The Company currently manufactures, and has jointly developed, twenty-five products that are being sold and supplied to current customers and we continue to receive orders for custom prototype sensors as well as our standard sensors.  We are continuing to develop and enhance our intellectual properties that will result in additional patents being filed.

www.flexpoint.com On October 18, 2018, the Company announced it had signed a five year manufacturing and supply agreement with Counted LLC.  Counted LLC conceived of a medication delivery monitoring system and dispensing monitoring system. Flexpoint designed and produced the monitoring system with Flexpoint features, Flexpoint technology and Flexpoint designed electronics to track and report the dispensing of medications in real time.  This information has the potential to be transmitted to physicians, pharmacists and governmental agencies.  Prototypes have been built and successfully tested and it is expected that additional production and testing will continue throughout the remainder of the year with production increasing in 2019.
The Company has completed delivery of two different products to Haemoband, Ltd. and continues to work with them toward the completion of their testing program for product launch.
The Company continues to develop relationships in a number of application fields.  We have a working relationship for the production of sensors for glove based IR/VR applications with Manus VR and others. Flexpoint has also established relationships with several medical IoT vendors.  These include companies like Neofect, Gloreha and YouReHab; all with a focus on medical rehabilitation with a different approach.  Products from these companies range from gloves to prosthetics to virtual reality, all with the intention of improving medical health or medical rehab.
We continue to work with OEM's and Tier 1 automotive suppliers on a variety of products that are in various stages of development and implementation. Due to the size and the numerous regulations inherent in the automotive industry, it requires a significantly longer time to develop and acquire approvals for new technologies. However, as there are high volumes associated within the automotive industry, we anticipate that this industry will potentially generate significant long-term revenue streams.  Both the medical and automotive industries have undergone significant changes over the past several years. Based upon the current interest in our sensors from both the automotive and medical industries, we anticipate that over the next twelve months, we will begin producing larger repeatable volumes of sensors and devices in these focus industries. 
We appreciate the confidence you have shown in the Company and acknowledge your important contribution toward the future success of Flexpoint and its technology.  You can keep informed about the Company through our periodic press releases and on our web-site at www.flexpoint.com.   If you have any questions regarding the Company you may contact us at (801) 568-5111. Once again, we appreciate your confidence in Flexpoint as we move into the future.
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
Sincerely,

 INFORMATION REGARDING THE MEETING 
[END TABLE]
Why am I receiving these materials?  The Board is providing materials to you in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders, which will take place on December 28, 2018.  As a stockholder you are invited to attend the annual meeting and are requested to vote on the items of business described in this Proxy Statement.
How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals?  The Board recommends a vote FOR:
1)
Increasing the authorized common stock from One Hundred Million (100,000,000) to Two Hundred Million (200,000,000);
2)
Effecting a reverse split (the "Reverse Split") of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of 1-for-50; and
3)
Electing two directors to our board of directors
Who is entitled to vote?  Stockholders as of the close of business on November 16, 2018 ("Record Date") are entitled to vote at the meeting.
What is the difference between holding shares as a "stockholder of record" and as a "beneficial owner"?  Many Flexpoint common stockholders hold their shares through a broker or other nominee rather than directly in their own name.  As summarized below, there are some distinctions between common shares held of record and those owned beneficially.
Stockholder of Record:  If your common shares are registered directly in your name with Flexpoint's common stock transfer agent, Standard Registrar & Transfer Company, Inc., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.  As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to Flexpoint or to vote in person at the annual meeting.  A proxy card is enclosed for your use.
Beneficial Owner:  If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee (often referred to as being held in "street name"), you are considered the beneficial owner of such shares, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you together with a voting instruction card by your broker, trustee or nominee, as the case may be.  As the beneficial owner you have the right to direct your broker, trustee or nominee, how to vote and you are also invited to attend the annual meeting.
Since a beneficial owner is not a stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, trustee or nominee that holds your  shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting.  Your broker, trustee or nominee should have enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing the broker, trustee or other nominee hot to vote your shares.
How do I vote without attending the meeting?  Sign and date the proxy card or voting instruction card you receive with this proxy statement and return it in the prepaid envelope.  If you return your signed proxy card or voting instruction card but do not mark the boxes showing how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted FOR the proposals.  You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by: 
 Notifying Standard Registrar & Transfer Company, Inc.; or
 Voting in person; or
 Returning a later-date proxy card
Who can attend the annual meeting?  All of our stockholders on November 16, 2018, can attend.  Due to limited space in the meeting room, we are limiting the persons who can attend the meeting to our stockholders, their representatives, our employees and directors and our representatives.
How can I attend the annual meeting?  Because seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis.  You should be prepared to present photo identification for admittance.  If you are not a stockholder of record as of the record date but held the shares in street name, you should provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the record date, such as you most recent account statement prior to November 16, 2018, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker, trustee or nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership.  If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined above, you may not be admitted to the annual meeting.
How will voting on any other business be conducted?  Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the meeting other than the proposals described in this proxy statement, if any other business is presented at the meeting, your signed proxy card gives authority to John A. Sindt, our Chairman of the Board, and Clark M. Mower, our President, to vote on those matters at their discretion.
Who will count the votes?  We have appointed Standard Registrar & Transfer Company, Inc. as the inspector of the election.  Their representative will count and tabulate the votes.
Is my vote confidential?  Your vote will not be disclosed except: 
 as needed to permit the inspector of election to tabulate and certify the vote;
 as required by law; or
 in limited circumstances, such as a proxy contest in opposition to the Board.
Additionally, all comments written on the proxy card or elsewhere will be forwarded to our management, but your identity will be kept confidential unless you ask that your name be disclosed.
What shares are included on the proxy card?  The shares on your proxy card represent ALL of your shares, including those shares held in your accounts at various brokerages.  If you do not return your proxy card, your shares will not be voted.
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card?  If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card.  Sign and return all the proxy cards you receive to ensure that all your shares are voted. How many shares can vote?  As of the Record Date, 92,863,464 shares of common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote.  Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter being considered.
What is a "quorum"?  A "quorum" is a majority of the outstanding shares.  They may be present at the meeting or represented by proxy.  There must be a quorum for the meeting to be held, and for a proposal to be adopted it must be approved by more than 50% of the shares voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum present.  The two nominees for director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected as directors.  If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting, then you will be considered part of the quorum.  However, abstentions are not counted in the tally of votes FOR or AGAINST a proposal.  We intended to treat shares referred to as "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which the broker or nominee indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote) as shares that are presented and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.  We will not consider broker non-votes as votes cast either for or against a particular matter.
Who are the largest principal stockholders?  As of November 16, 2018, one stockholder owned more than 5% of our capital stock.  First Equity Holdings Corp. beneficially owns 5,985,858 shares of our common stock, representing 6.4% of our outstanding common stock.
How much did this proxy solicitation cost?  We did hire Standard Registrar & Transfer Company, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of the proxy materials and the solicitations of votes.  We estimate that our costs for those actions (which will be conducted by our employees, officers and directors) will be approximately $5,700. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to our stockholders.
How do I revoke my proxy after I give it?  A stockholder giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation may revoke it at any time prior to its exercise at the meeting by delivering to our President a written notice of revocation, or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting will not, however, constitute revocation of your proxy without your further action.  Any written notice revoking your proxy should be sent to our transfer agent's offices addressed as follows:

 PROPOSAL NO. 1 – AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE    AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
 PROPOSAL NO. 1 – AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE    AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
[END TABLE]
Proposed Amendment 
On November 16, 2018, the Board adopted resolutions (i) proposing to submit an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000; and (ii) directing that a proposal to approve the increase in authorized common stock be submitted to the holders of the Company's common stock for their approval. 
The Company currently has authority under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 92,863,464 shares were issued and outstanding as of the Record Date.   In addition, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides for 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $0.001 (the "Preferred Stock").  No Preferred Stock has been issued to date.
Purpose of the Proposed Amendment 
For the reasons described below, the Board believes the Company must seek to increase its common equity capital by a substantial amount.  We currently have only 7,136,536 shares of common stock available for issuance under our Certificate of Incorporation.  Currently, the number of our remaining authorized shares is insufficient to satisfy our convertible debt.
The Board believes the additional authorized shares of common stock may be used for corporate purposes, such as, raising capital for operations, conversion of debt, stock dividends and possible acquisitions of other technologies or businesses.  However, any such future actions must be deemed appropriate by our board of directors and, if applicable, be approved by other regulatory authorities. 
The Board has approved the proposed amendment and recommends that the stockholders vote to approve it at the Annual Meeting in order to provide the Company with the ability to satisfy debt and to act quickly in response to market conditions to raise capital through issuances of our common stock as opportunities arise. 
Effects of the Proposed Amendment 
The proposed amendment would not change the rights provided by our common stock, nor would it affect the rights of the holders of currently issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.  If this proposal is approved, the additional shares of our common stock may be issued from time to time upon authorization of the Board, unless otherwise required by applicable law, without further approval by the stockholders and at such price or for such other consideration as the Board may deem appropriate. 
No further stockholder approval would be required under the listing rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The authorization of the additional shares of our common stock sought by this proposal would not have any immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of our existing stockholders. The Company's existing stockholders, however, do not have preemptive rights to purchase any additional shares of our common stock that may be issued in the future. Accordingly, to the extent that the additional authorized shares of our common stock are issued in the  future they may decrease the existing stockholders' percentage of equity ownership and depending on the price at which they are issued, could be dilutive to the book value per share and earnings per share of existing stockholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR APPROVAL TO AMEND THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL NO. 2 – AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION  TO EFFECT REVERSE SPLIT  
 PROPOSAL NO. 2 – AMEND CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION  TO EFFECT REVERSE SPLIT  
[END TABLE]
Proposed Amendment 
On November 16, 2018, the Board adopted resolutions (i) proposing to submit an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a Reverse Split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock, and (ii) directing that a proposal to approve the Reverse Split be submitted to the holders of the Company's common stock for their approval.  The Reverse Split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will be set at a ratio of 1-for-50.  Fractional shares of 0.5 and higher will be rounded up to one share
Currently, the Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 92,863,464 shares were issued and outstanding as of the Record Date.  The Reverse Split will result in approximately 1,857,278 shares of common stock outstanding.  The Reverse Split will require the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.  
Purpose of the Proposed Amendment 
The Board believes the reduction of outstanding common stock as a result of the Reverse Split will provide additional authorized shares of common stock available for other corporate purposes, including capital raising, satisfaction of debt, stock dividends and possible acquisitions of other technologies or businesses.  In the future, such actions must be deemed appropriate by our board of directors and approved by applicable regulatory authorities. 
The Board believes that the Reverse Split is in the best interest of the Company. Under economic theory, and as experience shows, the factor the Company uses for the reverse stock split becomes the multiple that the market automatically uses to adjust the share price.  Accordingly, the market price of our common stock should rise in an inverse amount to the ratio of the Reverse Split.  The Board believes that the proposed ratio of 1-for-50 will result in an increased stock price that may limit the application of the Penny Stocks Rules (Exchange Act Rules 3a51-1 and 15g-1 through 15g-100) that regulate the sale of our trading shares. This action may improve the marketability and liquidity of the Company's common stock, as well as encourage investor interest.  However, the market price of our common stock is also based on other factors including our performance, general economic and market conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Accordingly, following the initial expected rise of the market price following the implementation of the Reverse Split, the market price of our stock may fall, resulting in a loss of net value to your portfolio. Potential Risks of the Reverse Split
There can be no assurance that the bid price of the Company's common stock will continue at a level in proportion to the reduction in the number of outstanding shares resulting from the Reverse Split. Further, we cannot give any assurances that the Reverse Split will encourage investor interest and improve the marketability and liquidity of the Company's common stock.
Additionally, the liquidity of the Company's common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after the Reverse Split. Although the Board believes that a higher stock price may help generate investor interest, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Split will result in a per-share price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, any decreased liquidity that may result from having fewer shares outstanding may not be offset by increased investor interest in the Company's common stock.
Effects of the Reverse Split on Common Stock
The effective date of the Reverse Split shall be determined in the discretion of our Board and subject to market regulations.  After the effective date of the Reverse Split, but no later than 90 days from the filing of the Certificate of Amendment related to the Reverse Split, each stockholder will own a reduced number of shares of our common stock, but will hold the same percentage of the outstanding shares as such stockholder held prior to the effective date.  The Reverse Split will affect all of our stockholders uniformly, except to the extent that the Reverse Split results in any of the Company's stockholders receiving additional shares as a result of or owning a fractional share that is rounded up, as described below. 
The number of stockholders of record will not be affected by the Reverse Split. Proportionate voting rights and other rights and preferences of the holders of the Company's common stock will not be affected by the Reverse Split other than as a result of the rounding up of fractional shares. All shares underlying outstanding options and warrants will also be automatically adjusted on the effective date of the Reverse Split.
The Reverse Split will not affect the par value of our common stock and the Company should not recognize any gain or loss as a result of the Reverse Split.  As a result, on the effective date of any such implementation, the stated capital on our balance sheet attributable to our common stock will be reduced in proportion with the exchange ratio for the Reverse Split and our additional paid-in capital account will be credited with the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. These accounting entries will have no impact on total stockholders' equity.  In future SEC periodic report filings all share and per share information will be retroactively adjusted following the effective date to reflect the Reverse Split for all periods presented. 
Fractional Shares
No fractional shares of the Company's common stock will be issued as a result of the proposed Reverse Split. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company will round up any fractional shares of 0.5 and higher to the next highest full share.  Implementation and Exchange of Stock Certificates
The Reverse Split will be effective upon approval of the Company-Related Action Notification filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").  As of the effective date set by FINRA, each certificate representing shares of the Company common stock before the Reverse Split would be deemed, for all corporate purposes, to evidence ownership of the reduced number of shares of the Company's common stock resulting from the Reverse Split.  
There will be no mandatory exchange of certificates; rather certificates will be exchanged in the ordinary course of business.
The Company's transfer agent, Standard Registrar & Transfer Company, Inc., will act as exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange of stock certificates. No new certificates will be issued to a stockholder until such stockholder has surrendered any outstanding certificates to the transfer agent.  Until surrendered, each certificate representing shares before the Reverse Split will continue to be valid and will represent the adjusted number of shares based on the ratio of the Reverse Split.  Stockholders should not destroy any stock certificate and should not submit any certificates until after the Reverse Split has become effective.  Persons who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or "street name" will not be required to take any further actions to effect the exchange of their shares. 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, WE INFORM YOU THAT ANY FEDERAL TAX ADVICE CONTAINED IN THIS INFORMATION STATEMENT IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR PURPOSES OF (I) AVOIDING PENALTIES UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED, OR (II) PROMOTING, MARKETING OR RECOMMENDING TO ANOTHER PARTY ANY TRANSACTION OR TAX-RELATED MATTER ADDRESSED HEREIN. YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE FOR YOURSELF THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE REVERSE SPLIT, IF ANY, INCLUDING SUCH TAX EFFECTS UNDER STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS.
The following discussion sets forth the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences that management believes will apply to the Company and the Company's stockholders who are U.S. holders at the effective time of the Reverse Split. This discussion does not address the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior to or after the Reverse Split, including, without limitation, the tax consequences of the exercise of options, warrants or similar rights to purchase stock. Furthermore, no foreign, state or local tax considerations are addressed herein. For this purpose, a U.S. holder is a stockholder that is: (a) a citizen or resident of the United States, (b) a domestic corporation, (c) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or (d) a trust if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
The following discussion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service. The following discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code, laws, regulations, rulings and decisions in effect as of the date of this information statement, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Holders of shares of the Common Stock are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the Reverse Split, including the applicability and effect of federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws in their particular circumstances. No gain or loss should be recognized by a stockholder upon his or her exchange of pre-Reverse Split shares for post-Reverse Split shares. The aggregate tax basis of the post-Reverse Split shares received (including any fraction of a new share deemed to have been received) will be the same as the stockholder's aggregate tax basis in the pre-Reverse Split shares exchanged therefore. The stockholder's holding period for the post-Reverse Split shares will include the period during which the stockholder held the pre-Reverse Split shares surrendered in the Reverse Split.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR APPROVAL 
TO AMEND THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT THE REVERSE SPLIT.

Directors and Executive Officers
Our current directors and executive officers are listed below.

[END TABLE]
Legal Proceedings:  During the past ten years none of our executive officers have been involved in any legal proceedings that are material to an evaluation of their ability or integrity; namely:  (1) filed a petition under federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency laws, nor had a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer appointed by a court for the business or property of such person, or any partnership in which he was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing, or any corporation or business association of which he was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing; (2) been convicted in a criminal proceeding or named subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) been the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him or her from or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or (4) been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any federal or state securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the SEC has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated. Board and Committee Meetings:  The Flexpoint Board did not hold a formal meeting of the Board during the fiscal year.  Board actions were authorized by unanimous written consent.  The Audit Committee did not hold any meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.  We do not have a standing nominating committee for directors or a compensation committee, but our Board (Messrs. Sindt and Mower) acts as our nominating and compensation committee.  
Director Independence:  An independent director is defined under NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a) (2). This rule defines persons as "independent" who are neither officers nor employees of the company and have no relationships that, in the opinion of the board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors.  We do not currently have a director who qualifies as an independent director.
Audit Committee:  Our Audit Committee consists of our current directors, Messrs. Sindt and Mower.  Our audit committee adopted a written charter in June 2005 and a copy of this charter is attached as Appendix B.  The audit committee's functions include:
$
the direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the outside auditor;
$
the authority and funding to engage independent counsel and other outside advisors if the audit committee deems it necessary to carry out its duties;
$
the sole duty and responsibility to review and approve all related party transactions;
$
review and discuss the audited financial statements with management;
$
discuss with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 61, as may be modified or supplemented;
$
receive the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as may be modified or supplemented, 
$
discuss with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence; and
$
based on its review and discussions, will recommend to the Board whether the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management believes Mr. Mower qualifies as an audit committee financial expert because of his extensive experience in finance.  However, based upon the definition of independent director under NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2), Mr. Mower is not independent of management. 
Oversight of Risk Management  Our Board is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing our exposure to risk.  The Board evaluates our business, regulatory, operational and other risks associated with our planned strategies and tactics, as well as, identifies and manages enterprise-wide risks.  In addition, the leadership structure of the Board currently consists of a Chairman of the Board who oversees the Board meetings.  We separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Office in recognition of the differences between the two roles.  Our board believes this division of responsibility is an effective approach for addressing the risks we face. 
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act:   Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than five percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock.  Officers, directors and ten-percent or more beneficial owners of our common stock are required by SEC regulations to furnish Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc. with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file and provide written representation that no Form 5 is required.  We believe no Forms 5 were required to be filed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Related Party Transactions:   During the past two fiscal years and through the date of this proxy statement, the following transactions were entered into by Flexpoint and current nominees for director.  These transactions between Flexpoint and the nominees have been negotiated between related parties without "arm's length" bargaining and, as a result, the terms of these transactions may be different than transactions negotiated between unrelated persons.
At December 31, 2017, Mr. Sindt, Chairman of the Board, has loaned funds to the Company for operations and the Company has notes outstanding of $27,256 due Mr. Sindt.  The notes bear an 8% annual rate of interest with a 12% default rate.  All of the convertible notes are convertible into shares of common stock at the rate of $0.07 per share. 
On August 28, 2018, the Company entered into another convertible note with Mr. Sindt for $5,000.  This note is due December 31, 2019 and is convertible into shares of common stock at the rate of $0.06 per share. 
At December 31, 2017, Mr. Mower had notes outstanding of $87,257 related to funds loaned to the Company to pay for various operating expenses of the business.  The notes bear an 8% annual rate of interest with a 12% default rate. These notes were due as follows:  $10,000 was due November 30, 2016, $10,000 was due December 31, 2016, $30,000 was due December 31, 2017, and $64,513 is due December 31, 2018.  These notes are convertible into shares of common stock at the rate of $0.07 per share.
On August 28, 2018, the Company entered into a convertible note with Mr. Mower for $60,000.  This note is due December 31, 2019 and is convertible into shares of common stock at the rate of $0.06 per share.

FLEXPOINT SENSOR SYSTEMS, INC.
 AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
ORGANIZATION
There shall be a committee appointed by the board of directors of Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc., hereafter (The "Company") to be known as the Audit Committee.
STATEMENT OF POLICY
The Audit Committee shall provide assistance to the board of directors in fulfilling their responsibility to the shareholders, potential shareholders, and investment community relating to corporate accounting, reporting practices of the Company and the quality and integrity of the financial reports of the Company.  In so doing, it is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to maintain free and open means of communication between the directors, the independent auditors and Company management.
COMPOSITION
The Audit Committee may be composed of as few as two members.  At least one of the members of the Audit Committee must be a director who is independent of the management of the Company and free of any relationship that, in the opinion of the board of directors, would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment as a committee member and the other member(s) may not be independent.
All members of the Audit Committee shall have a working familiarity with basic finance and accounting practices, and at least one member of the Audit Committee shall have accounting or related financial management expertise.
The members of the Audit Committee shall be appointed by the Board and shall serve until their successors shall be duly qualified and appointed.  Unless a chair is appointed by the full Board, the members of the Audit Committee may designate a chair by majority vote of the full Audit Committee membership.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee shall meet at least four times annually, or more frequently as circumstances dictate.  As part of its responsibility to foster open communication, the Audit Committee or its members are expected to meet for discussions with Company management frequently, and will have at least two formal meetings with Company management in the presence of the independent auditors or may meet in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters that the Audit Committee believes should be discussed privately.
AUDIT COMMITTEE AUTHORITY
The Board of Directors shall grant to the audit committee:
 the direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the outside auditor  the authority and funding to engage independent counsel and other outside advisors if the Audit Committee deems it necessary to carry out its duties
 the sole duty and responsibility to review and approve all related party transactions.
RESPONSIBILITIES
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee's policies and procedures will remain flexible, in order to best react to changing conditions and to ensure that the corporate accounting and reporting practices of the Company are in accordance with all requirements and are of the highest quality.
In carrying out these responsibilities, the Audit Committee shall:
1.    Develop an effective audit committee charter approved by the Board of Directors.  Update  this charter at least annually or as business development may dictate.
2.    Influence the overall Company "tone" for quality financial reporting, sound business risk controls, and ethical behavior.
3.    The Audit Committee must determine whether the relationship between the existing independent auditors and the Company complies with the requirements of the listing standards, rules and regulations.  Maintain an active dialog with the independent auditors to identify and disclose any relationship or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the auditors.
4.    Meet with the independent auditors and financial management of the Company to review the scope of the proposed audit for the current year and the audit procedures to be utilized, and at the conclusion thereof, review the results of such audit, including any comments or recommendations of the independent auditors.
5.    Provide sufficient opportunity for the independent auditors to meet with the members of the Audit Committee without members of management present.  Among the items to be discussed in these meetings are the independent auditor's evaluation of the Company's financial and accounting personnel, and the cooperation that the independent auditors received during the course of the audit.
6.    Ensure that the independent auditors review interim financial statements and conduct a quality discussion with the independent auditors before the Company files its quarterly report.
7.    The Audit Committee on a regular basis shall also monitor the integrity and quality of internal financial and operating information used by management in its decision making process.
8.    Consider and review with the independent auditors:
      (a)  Any significant findings in the independent auditors SAS 71 interim financial statement review prior to the Company's filing of its periodic report.
      (b)  The adequacy of the Company's internal controls, including computerized information system controls and security.
      (c)  Any significant findings and recommendations of the independent auditors together with management's responses thereto. 9.    Discuss with the party responsible for investor relations what is being said or asked about the Company, as it may further assist the Audit Committee in asking probing questions to management.
10.    Establish pre-approval procedures for all audit and non-audit services.
11.    Establish appropriate procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees regarding questionable accounting matters.
12.    Review the management representation letter issued to the independent auditor.
13.    Emphasize the adequacy of internal controls to identify any payments, transactions, or procedures that might be deemed illegal or otherwise improper.
14.    Monitor the integrity and quality of annual and interim financial reporting to shareholders in coordination with management and the independent auditors.  Determine that the independent auditors are satisfied with the disclosure and content of the financial statements to be presented to the shareholders.  Review changes in accounting principles and concur as to their appropriateness.
15.    Monitor compliance with the Company code of ethics and regulatory requirements, and review and assess conflicts of interest and related-party transactions.
16.    Evaluate and make recommendations regarding management initiatives affecting the financing of the Company and related matters.
17.   Review and approve any required stock exchange certifications, if any.
18.   Review and approve any required proxy or information statement disclosure.
19.   Assess independent auditor performance.
20.   Assess Audit Committee members' performance.
21.   Provide a report of the audit committee's findings that result from its financial reporting oversight responsibilities including representation that the Audit Committee has:
      (a)  discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended.
      (b)  received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Independence Discussions with Audit Committees, as amended, by the Independence Standards Board.
      (c)  discussed with the auditors the auditors' independence.
22.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Flexpoint Sensor Systems, Inc. ("the Company") as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2017 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.
