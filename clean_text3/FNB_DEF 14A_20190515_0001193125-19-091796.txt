 Proactive, Engaged and Committed Board    Our Culture 
     Shareholder Engagement: Continued our annual  shareholder engagement program. In 2018, our senior management and members of our Board reached out to shareholders who own approximately 56% of our common stock and to leading proxy advisory firms, for the purpose of discussing corporate  responsibility matters and our executive compensation practices. For additional information on shareholder engagement, please see Say-on-Pay Support and Investor  Engagement in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis.     Empowered Independent Lead Director: Our  Independent Lead Director is annually selected by independent directors and is empowered with robust, broad authority.     Effective Board Succession and Refreshment  Processes: Robust Board succession and refreshment process as illustrated by the addition of 13 directors and transition of 17 directors since 2009 (which includes Director Gurgovits who will retire in accordance with our Director  Retirement Policy at the conclusion of our Annual Meeting on May 15, 2019).     Committed Board: High rate of attendance at 2018  Board and committee meetings that averaged approximately 98%.     Board Aligned with Shareholders: Strong alignment  with shareholder interests, since a substantial portion of director compensation is paid in F.N.B. common stock.         Risk Oversight: We protect against excessive  risk-taking through multiple lines of defense, including Board oversight.     Honesty and Integrity: Our Code of Conduct  applies to all directors and employees, providing a framework for high-level ethical conduct.     Continuing to Evolve and Innovate: We strongly  encourage directors to remain current on such topics as corporate governance, regulatory compliance, fiduciary oversight standards and corporate responsibility development, by requiring them to participate in internally-developed training programs.  We also provide them with equity grant incentives for participation at qualified national, regional and local continuing board education programs and provide them access to topical board guidance articles by distinguished scholars and industry  leaders.

Shareholder Outreach 
The Compensation Committee is proactively engaged with its shareholders. Specifically, the Committee is committed to communicating the successful execution of our long-term strategy as a result of our 72% say-on-pay result in 2018. In 2018, our senior management and members of our Board reached out to shareholders who own approximately 56% of our common stock and to a leading proxy advisory firm. We heard some key themes from these meetings, and made direct changes based on these themes as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Added ROATA as an additional metric to our long-term incentive plan (LTIP), utilizing ROATA as the  primary metric and total shareholder return (TSR) as a modifier. This is consistent with our Compensation Committee's ongoing efforts to identify the most appropriate performance measurements that optimally align our executive compensation  practices with the Board's expectations regarding our strategic direction and long-term value creation and the interests of our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To demonstrate pay and performance alignment of our compensation plans, we added a target pay  opportunity graph to the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A) (see page 48) and more detailed disclosure concerning the strong link between achievement of our performance measures and the vesting of long-term equity awards.  Specifically, this additional disclosure illustrates a direct correlation between our TSR performance metric and the fact that our long-term performance-based equity awards do not vest unless the performance metrics are achieved.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reorganized the CD&A with particular emphasis on an Executive Summary to better and more  clearly articulate performance, highlights of the compensation program and our holistic pay-setting process.  
[END TABLE]
Business Strategy 
The Board of Directors is in full support of the business strategy of the Company. The Directors have approved a strategic plan which continues to be successfully executed by management. At the same time, the Company, through its compensation programs, believes in a pay-for-performance culture. To that point, and as highlighted in the CD&A, the realized pay levels through short- and long-term incentives directly reflect alignment with the shareholder value over a multi-year period.

Corporate culture, like many intangible assets, is difficult to measure, but we believe our commitments highlighted below, along with the corporate responsibility strategies detailed in our 2019 F.N.B. Corporation Corporate Responsibility Report (2019 Corporate Responsibility Report) (located on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us/community-involvement) best illustrate our corporate culture. 
F.N.B. one-time 401(k) contribution to benefit our lower wage employees.

By year-end 2019, all of our employees will be paid a minimum hourly wage of $15.00. This pay increase will have a particularly meaningful impact for our tellers, customer service representatives, operations employees and other similarly situated employees. 
Our Board members and employees collectively provided more than 27,000 hours of their time in 2018 to support various organizations, including many serving in leadership roles in charities, nonprofit organizations and civic endeavors. 
Our Corporate Responsibility Committee is charged with coordinating our management oversight and disclosures of our strategies, tactics, policies and activities concerning community relations, diversity, employee welfare, environmental sustainability and corporate governance. The Committee also is responsible for developing our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights F.N.B.'s achievements and future endeavors in social, environmental, corporate governance and employee welfare matters.

Who can attend our Annual Meeting? 
All shareholders as of the close of business on March 6, 2019 (the record date), or their duly appointed proxies, may attend our Annual Meeting. Even if you currently plan to attend our Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote by any of the applicable methods described in the response to the question, "How do I vote?" so that your vote will be counted at our Annual Meeting if you later decide not to attend. 
If your shares are held in street name by your bank or brokerage firm, you will need to bring a valid form of identification along with a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your ownership of F.N.B. stock as of the March 6, 2019, record date, and check in at the registration desk at our Annual Meeting. 
What are the requirements for admittance to the Annual Meeting? 
Only shareholders as of the record date have a right to attend the Annual Meeting. In order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you will need to present a government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport) and, if you hold your shares in an account at a bank or brokerage firm, recent evidence of ownership of our common stock as of the record date (such as a brokerage account statement, a letter of proxy from your broker, or other intermediary). Entrance after the Annual Meeting has commenced will be prohibited. If you are representing an entity that is a shareholder, you must also present documentation showing your authority to attend and act on behalf of the entity (such as a power of attorney, written proxy to vote or letter of authorization on the entity's letterhead). We reserve the right to limit the number of representatives for any entity that may be admitted to the meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, large bags or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. The use of cell phones, smart phones, tablets and other personal communication devices during the Annual Meeting is also prohibited. 
What is a proxy? 
Your proxy gives us authority to vote your shares and tells us how to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment. Three of our employees, who are called "proxy holders" (or "proxies" for short) and are named on the proxy card, will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting according to the instructions you give on the proxy card. 
Why are you soliciting a proxy from me? 
Our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to make sure that your vote is properly submitted and received on time, and to improve the efficiency of the Annual Meeting. We may ask for, or solicit, proxies using several methods. 
We may solicit proxies by mail, personal interviews, telephone or fax. We may also use the Internet to solicit proxies. F.N.B. officers or employees may solicit proxies but will not receive any special compensation for doing so. We have engaged the firm of Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC to assist us with soliciting proxies. 
What will our shareholders vote on at our Annual Meeting? 
Our shareholders will vote on each of the following proposals which our Board recommends you vote "FOR," at our Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Who is entitled to vote at our meeting? 
Our Board has set March 6, 2019, as the record date for our Annual Meeting. Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at our Annual Meeting and any adjournment of our Annual Meeting. F.N.B. shareholders who plan to attend our Annual Meeting may obtain driving directions to the meeting location by contacting our shareholder services representative at (888) 981-6000 and asking to be connected to extension 4254. 
What are the voting rights of our shareholders? 
The only class of our securities that is outstanding and entitled to vote at our Annual Meeting is our common stock. As of the March 6, 2019, record date, we had 323,810,141 shares of our common stock each entitled to one vote per share with respect to each matter to be voted on at our Annual Meeting. 
What is a quorum? 
On March 6, 2019, our record date, we had 324,500,253 shares of common stock outstanding. Under Pennsylvania law, we must have a quorum before we can consider proposals at our Annual Meeting. A quorum is the number of shares that must be present at the meeting. In determining if a quorum exists, we count the number of shares represented by shareholders in person, as well as the number of shares represented by proxies. If you return a signed and dated proxy card, vote by Internet, vote by our QR Code feature, vote by telephone or vote in person at our Annual Meeting, you will be considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum. 
What constitutes a quorum in order to conduct the Annual Meeting? 
To have a quorum, we need the presence of shareholders or their proxies who are entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast. If you return a proxy, whether you vote for or against a proposal, abstain from voting or only sign and date your proxy card, your holdings will be counted toward the quorum. 
Although a quorum may be achieved, not all proposals will be subject to the same voting or approval requirement. Shareholders who hold their shares in an account at a bank or brokerage firm (street name) may need to take additional precautions to ensure that their vote counts. We discuss the vote required to approve each proposal under the question immediately below. 
What vote is required to approve each matter? 
In general, for a proposal to be approved, it requires a majority of the votes "cast" on the matter. Votes "cast" are votes "for" or "against" the proposal. If you abstain from voting, it will not count as a vote "cast." However, please see the summaries below for more specific information about how proposals are approved and how abstentions will be counted with respect to each proposal. With respect to Proposals 1, 2 and 3, if you desire to abstain, you must check the "Abstain" box on your proxy card, or select the appropriate option when voting by the Internet, by QR Code or by telephone. 
PROPOSAL 1.    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our bylaws provide that in the circumstance of an uncontested director election, which is the case for this year's director election, our directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at our Annual Meeting. Our Articles of Incorporation do not authorize cumulative voting for the election of directors. To receive a majority of votes cast means that the shares voted for a director's election exceed the number of votes cast against that director's election. Moreover, our bylaws provide that any incumbent director who does not receive a majority of votes cast will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. Upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board shall determine whether to accept the resignation. If there is a contested election (which is not the case in 2019), directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast at the meeting.

PROPOSAL 2.    "SAY ON PAY" ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
A majority of the votes cast will be required to approve the advisory vote on 2018 executive compensation. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Corporation. This matter is considered a non-routine matter and, as a result, there may be broker non-votes (see description of broker non-votes in the next section, below). 
PROPOSAL 3.    RATIFICATION OF AUDITOR 
A majority of the votes cast will be required to approve the ratification of our Audit Committee's selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. This matter is considered a routine item, and brokers have the discretion to vote uninstructed shares on behalf of clients. 
Impact of Broker Non-Votes or Abstentions 
With respect to Proposals 1, 2 and 3, any broker non-votes or abstentions will not be included in the total votes cast and will not affect the results of the voting on these three proposals. 
How do I vote? 
You can vote either in person at our Annual Meeting or by proxy whether or not you attend our Annual Meeting. When you or your authorized attorney-in-fact grants us your proxy, you authorize us to vote your shares of our common stock in the manner you specify on your proxy card. Giving a proxy allows your shares to be voted at our Annual Meeting even if you do not attend the Annual Meeting in person. If your shares are held in street name, you will receive a separate card from your bank or brokerage firm with instructions about the manner in which you may vote your shares. 
If you hold your shares directly, to vote by proxy you must do one of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by mail.* Complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the envelope  provided (the envelope requires no postage if mailed in the United States) or return it to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you are a registered shareholder and attend our Annual  Meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person or request a voting ballot to vote in person at the meeting. Even if you returned a proxy to us before our Annual Meeting, you may revoke it and vote in person.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Internet* at www.proxyvote.com. Instructions are provided on your proxy  card. If you vote by Internet, you should not return your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by QR Code* by scanning the QR Code on your proxy card with your mobile device. If you  vote by QR Code, you should not return your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by telephone* at 1-800-690-6903. Instructions are provided on your proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you should not return your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
*Proxies voted by mail, by Internet, by QR Code or by telephone must be received by 11:59 PM Eastern Time, on May 14, 2019, in order to be counted in the vote. 
If you hold your F.N.B. shares in an account at a bank or brokerage firm, and you want to vote in person at our Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a signed proxy card from the brokerage firm or the bank that holds your F.N.B. stock. If your F.N.B. stock is registered in the name of a bank or brokerage firm, you also may be eligible to vote your shares electronically by Internet, by the QR Code on your proxy card and/or notice card, or by telephone. Many banks and brokerage firms participate in programs such as the Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. online program. These programs provide eligible shareholders who receive a paper copy of this proxy statement the opportunity to vote by the Internet, by QR Code or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm is participating in one of these programs, your proxy card will contain instructions for voting by Internet, by QR Code or by telephone. If your proxy card does not reference Internet, QR Code or telephone information, please complete and return the proxy card in the enclosed self-addressed, postage-paid envelope.

[END TABLE]
How will my shares be voted if I give my proxy but do not specify how my shares should be voted? 
If you sign, date and return your proxy card, but do not provide voting instructions, or if you do not provide voting instructions when voting over the Internet, we will vote your shares represented by that proxy as recommended by our Board of Directors (see What are the Board's voting recommendations?), and this vote will count as a vote cast. 
Can I change my vote after I have voted? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before it is voted at our Annual Meeting. You may change your vote by delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at F.N.B. Corporation, One North Shore Center, 12 Federal Street, Suite 503, Pittsburgh, PA 15212, by signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date, by voting by the Internet, by scanning the QR Code on your proxy card with your mobile device at a later date, by telephone, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Only your latest instruction will be counted; however, your attendance at our Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at our Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation prior to our Annual Meeting to our Corporate Secretary at F.N.B. Corporation, One North Shore Center, 12 Federal Street, Suite 503, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212. 
How do I vote if my shares are held in street name? 
If you hold your shares in street name in an account at a bank or brokerage firm, we generally cannot mail our proxy materials directly to you. Instead, your bank or brokerage firm will forward our proxy materials to you and tell you how to give them instructions for voting your F.N.B. shares. 
Please ensure that you instruct your bank or brokerage firm how to vote your shares. Under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules applicable to brokers, your broker has discretionary authority to vote your shares without receiving your instructions on "routine" matters. The only routine matter before our Annual Meeting will be the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. All of the other proposals that will be considered at our Annual Meeting are "non-routine" matters. Your bank or brokerage firm does not have discretionary authority to vote on a non-routine matter unless you provide them with your voting instructions. The inability of your bank or brokerage firm to vote on a matter absent direction from you (while using its discretionary authority to vote on routine matters) is known as a "broker non-vote" on the non-routine matter. Therefore, in order to have your vote counted, please ensure that you instruct your bank or brokerage firm how to vote your shares with respect to the election of our directors, the advisory nonbinding resolution to approve the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers and the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
How do I vote my 401(k) Plan shares? 
If you participate in the F.N.B. Corporation Progress Savings 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan), you may vote the number of shares of common stock credited to your account as of the record date. You may vote by instructing T. Rowe Price, the trustee of our 401(k) Plan, pursuant to the voting instruction card being mailed with this proxy statement to plan participants. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your duly executed voting instruction card, provided that the trustee receives it by 3:00 AM, Eastern Time, on Friday, May 10, 2019. 
In the case of the 401(k) Plan, if you do not return your voting instruction card, the shares credited to your plan account will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes the shares for which it timely received voting instruction cards. 
You may also revoke a previously given proxy card until 3:00 AM, Eastern Time, on Friday, May 10, 2019, by filing with the trustee either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed voting instruction card or Internet vote, telephone vote, or scanned QR code vote having a later date. 
How will we conduct the business of our Annual Meeting? 
Our bylaws govern the organization and conduct of business at our shareholder meetings. Our bylaws specify that our Board Chairman is to preside at our shareholder meetings. Our Board Chairman, Vincent J. Delie, Jr., will serve as Chairman of our Annual Meeting and call the meeting to order. As Chairman of our Annual Meeting,

Who can answer my questions? 
Should you have questions concerning these proxy materials or our Annual Meeting or should you wish to request additional copies of this proxy statement or proxy card, you may contact our Corporate Secretary, at (888) 981-6000 and ask to be connected to extension 9833435. 
How can I avoid receiving more than one set of proxy materials in future years? 
If two or more registered shareholders live in your household or if a registered shareholder maintains two or more shareholder accounts, you may have received more than one set of our proxy materials. At your request, we will "household" your proxy materials (i.e., only one annual report and one proxy statement will be delivered to your address); however, a separate proxy card will be delivered for each account. On the proxy card, there will be a householding election where you will indicate if you consent to receive your proxy materials in a single package per household. Please refer to the section titled, "Householding" of Proxy Materials at the end of this proxy statement. 
Is my vote confidential? 
We process proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders in a manner that protects your voting privacy. We will not disclose your vote either within the Company or to third parties, except:

Who is paying for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
The Company is paying the costs of the solicitation of proxies. The Company has retained Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC to assist in obtaining proxies by mail, facsimile or email from registered holders, brokerage firms, bank nominees and other institutions for the Annual Meeting. The estimated cost of such service is $8,000 including out-of-pocket expenses. Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC may be contacted at 888-742-1305. 
The Company will also reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares held in street name for their reasonable costs associated with:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
We are committed to effective corporate governance for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders based on the fundamental principles of fairness, transparency, integrity and accountability which are the foundation of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Principles      
        Principles      
[END TABLE]
In performing its role, our Board of Directors is guided by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which establish a framework for the governance of the Board and the management of our Company. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are annually reviewed, updated as appropriate, and, with the assistance of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, approved by the Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect broadly recognized and evolving "best practice" governance standards and regulatory requirements, including the NYSE corporate governance listing standards, SEC governance standards, The U.S. Investor Stewardship Group Governance Principles, and other widely accepted "best" practices promoted by proxy advisory firms, institutional investors and national organizations dedicated to promoting sound governance practices. We believe that the strength of F.N.B.'s business and risk management processes reflects the high standards set by our rigorous governance structure. The full text of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is posted on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting the "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance" heading.

        Board Structure and Responsibility      
[END TABLE]
The Board is responsible for the oversight of management on behalf of the Company's shareholders. The Board and its committees meet regularly throughout the year to: (i) review and, where appropriate, approve long-term and short-term strategies, business and financial planning and performance, risk management, regulatory compliance, internal control and financial reporting and audit matters, executive compensation, Board and management succession, corporate culture, governance procedures and public, social and environmental responsibility matters; and (ii) provide oversight and guidance to, and regularly assess the performance of, the CEO and other senior executives. Here are some highlights regarding our corporate governance policies and practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Corporate Governance Highlights      
        Corporate Governance Highlights      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintain an Overwhelmingly Independent Board. 11 of our 12 director-nominees are  independent. Our independent directors are required to meet at least twice a year, but in practice, our Board regularly meets in executive sessions led by our Independent Lead Director.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Committees Composed of Independent Directors. Following our Annual Meeting, each of  our Board Committees, which conduct regular meetings during the year (Audit, Compensation, Credit Risk and CRA, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Risk Committees), will be composed entirely of independent directors.* Each of these committees operates under a written charter (posted on the Corporation's website at  www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting the "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance"  heading) approved by the Board and annually reviewed by each committee.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strive for Board Diversity and Seek Best Director Candidates. Our Corporate Governance  Guidelines expressly state that we shall consider diversity, among other important factors, in connection with Board composition determinations. In addition to skills and experience, we believe that a Board composed of a mix of diverse backgrounds,  including gender, age, race and ethnicity, creates a diversity of perspectives among the Board and thereby supports a more complex consideration of Company strategies and opportunities, and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Under its committee charter, our Executive Committee is only authorized to determine matters which do not  warrant convening a special meeting of the Board, but which should not be postponed until the next regular Board meeting, or other responsibilities which the Board may delegate to it. Our Executive Committee is chaired by our Board Chair/CEO who  does not qualify as independent. The Executive Committee met two times in 2018.

     ultimately, a more productive Board. Our Board reflects an appropriate range of skills and professional expertise, as well as a broad range of diverse backgrounds. Of our director-nominees, 33%  qualify as diverse under traditionally accepted diversity standards.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholder Access to Board. Shareholders may communicate directly with our Board or any  Board Committee or any individual director (see Communications with Our Board).    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All Audit Committee Members Qualify Under All SEC, NYSE and Federal Bank Regulatory  Standards. Each of our Audit Committee members qualifies as financially literate, a financial expert and independent under applicable SEC and NYSE standards and meet the stringent composition standards established by the federal bank regulatory  agencies. In addition, our Board policy provides that Audit Committee members cannot serve on more than one other public Company audit committee without the approval of our Board.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Internal Auditor Reports Directly to Audit Committee. Our internal auditor, who oversees  our internal audit function, reports directly to our Audit Committee.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Retirement Policy and Board Refreshment Practices. Our directors are required to  retire at age 75. However, our board has "grandfathered" our Independent Lead Director, William B. Campbell, who has served on our Board since F.N.B. was organized in 1974. In its decision to grandfather Director Campbell, the Board took  into account the considerable benefits that Director Campbell's Board tenure offers to us, including his indispensable historical perspective, experience and institutional knowledge as a Board member regarding the significant prior U.S.  economic and banking crises. Moreover, Director Campbell's dedicated commitment and proactive engagement has enabled him to exercise his unique and effective leadership skills which provide him the respect of his Board colleagues, executive  management and the necessary gravitas to serve effectively as our Independent Lead Director. We also believe in refreshing the Board. Since 2009, 17 F.N.B. directors will have transitioned off our Board as of our May 15, 2019, Annual Meeting  date, while we have added 13 new independent directors during that same time period.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Compensation Consultant. Our Compensation Committee retains an independent  compensation consultant to provide the Compensation Committee with advice and guidance on our executive and Board compensation and incentive programs.    
[END TABLE]

For details regarding our policy with regard to the consideration of director candidates recommended by our shareholders, we refer to Shareholder Proposals and Nominations for 2020  Annual Meeting and Identification and Evaluation of Director-Nominees elsewhere in this proxy statement and our Corporate Governance Guidelines on our corporate website.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conduct Annual Board and Individual Director Self-Assessment Evaluations. The Board and its  committees conduct rigorous annual self-evaluations. The self-assessment process is designed to evaluate Board, committee and individual director performance, to promote  best-in-class governance practices and to serve as one of the considerations as to whether to renominate a director for election to the Board. The results of the  self-evaluations are reported to the Board, as well as to each Board committee. In addition, each director receives his or her own assessment. Moreover, our self-assessment process enables us to identify ways for our Board and management to improve  our corporate governance practices and enhance the Board and committee performance.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Comprehensive Director Education Program. The F.N.B. director orientation and education  program, more fully detailed in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, provides the opportunity for new directors to participate in orientation sessions, including meetings with Board leadership and senior management, director mentorship and  orientation arrangements, and to receive associated written materials describing, among other matters, Company policies, fiduciary responsibilities, regulatory requirements and strategic plan objectives. Directors are provided an annual education  stipend to encourage them to attend local, regional and national director educational conferences, and each director is required to annually complete a full internal training curriculum designed to educate them on critical regulatory compliance  matters. Each F.N.B. director attended at least one outside director education session or conference in 2018 (many F.N.B. directors attended multiple director education sessions), and completed F.N.B.'s internal compliance curriculum.  Additionally, our directors and committees are routinely provided industry and academic publications for the purpose of staying well-informed of current trends, issues and best practices with respect to corporate governance, risk management,  compensation, audit, regulatory, corporate responsibility,

Also, senior management provides opportunity for F.N.B. directors to receive specialized one-on-one training on various topics concerning the Company's operations or risk management and compliance processes.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors Committed to Performance. The average attendance by directors at Board and  committee meetings during 2018 was approximately 98%. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the expectation that directors will attend all shareholder and Board meetings and those committee meetings of which they are a member, and at  a minimum, at least 75% of Board and committee meetings in the aggregate. Each of our director-nominees attended our 2018 Annual Meeting and at least 75% of our Board and committee meetings in the aggregate (see Our Board of Directors and its  Committees – Board Structure and Responsibilities). Our Board met eight times in 2018. We expect all the members of our Board to attend our 2019 Annual Meeting.

• Independent Lead Director. In view of our combined Chairman/CEO Board structure, the Board  recognizes the importance of independent and proactive leadership on the Board, as evidenced by its designation of an Independent Lead Director who is annually selected by the independent directors, and provided with the necessary tools to serve as  an effective counterbalance under our Board structure (see description of Unified Board Structure in this proxy statement). Our Independent Lead Director possesses broad powers, including the right to call a special meeting of independent  directors, consultation with the Chairman/CEO to create Board meeting agendas, materials and schedules, as well as leading executive sessions. Our Independent Lead Director attends all key Board committee meetings and consults with the committee  chairs, including with the Compensation Committee Chair regarding CEO performance and compensation.

        Unified Board Leadership Structure      
        Unified Board Leadership Structure      
[END TABLE]
During 2018, our Board reviewed its current unified leadership structure — combined Chairman and CEO with a strong Independent Lead Director — taking into consideration the Board's composition, the Company's size and complexity of its business operations, the regulatory framework under which the Company operates, the Company's shareholder base, the Company's Peer Group and other relevant factors. Our Board has determined that a combined Chairman and CEO position, coupled with a strongly empowered and effective Independent Lead Director, continues to be the most appropriate Board leadership structure for the Company because it provides for continuity of expertise in both business and corporate governance, promotes a better Board-level understanding of the inherent risks associated with the operation of our business and ensures that the Company has a clear public "face" for our shareholders, customers and employees.

[END TABLE]
Our principal Board committees serve as joint committees for both the Corporation and FNBPA and consist of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee (collectively, the Standing Committees). The Board has determined that all directors who served as members of the Standing Committees (including their Chairs) during 2018 are independent under the applicable NYSE standards and SEC rules and otherwise meet the specific eligibility requirements for these committees. The Corporation also has an Executive Committee. Each member of the Executive Committee has been determined by our Board to be independent except for Mr. Gurgovits (former CEO) and Mr. Delie (current CEO). FNBPA has a Credit Risk and CRA Committee. Each member of FNBPA's Credit Risk and CRA Committee has been determined by our Board to be independent except for Mr. Gurgovits (former CEO). The composition of the Credit Risk and CRA Committee is consistent with federal bank regulatory standards. Board Chairman Delie is an ex officio member of the Credit Risk and CRA Committee. We identify the current members and chairs of our Board and FNBPA committees in the table, Current Directors and Nominees for Election at Our Annual Meeting in this proxy statement. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee, consistent with Pennsylvania law, our bylaws and the committee charter, assists the Board by offering an efficient means of considering matters and issues during intervals between regular meetings of our Board or considering specific responsibilities which may be delegated to it from time-to-time by the Board. The Executive Committee met two times in 2018. 
Audit Committee 
In accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Audit Committee is responsible primarily for selecting and overseeing the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and internal audit department, evaluating our accounting policies and system of internal controls and reviewing significant financial transactions and compliance matters. In addition, the Audit Committee approves all audit services and permitted nonaudit services, as well as all engagement fees and terms related thereto. The Audit Committee met 13 times during 2018. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee, Directors Bena, Malone, Mencini, Nicholas and Stanik, qualify as being "financially literate," and each of these Audit Committee members also qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The determination that each of the Audit Committee members qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" included an evaluation of each person's qualifications and other relevant experience under applicable SEC rules and definitions, including consideration of each person's work, financial, business and professional experience. (For more detail regarding the work, financial, business and professional experience of Directors Bena, Malone, Mencini, Nicholas and Stanik considered by the Board in determining financial literacy and expertise, see the section titled Biographical Information Concerning Director-Nominees.) Each Audit Committee member also meets the additional criteria for independence of audit committee members set forth under the SEC rules, NYSE listing standards, F.N.B. categorical independence standards, and the applicable federal bank regulatory requirements. We refer you to the Report of the Audit Committee in this proxy statement. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee (also referred to as the "Committee" in the Executive Compensation and Other Proxy Disclosure discussion of this proxy statement) is responsible primarily for reviewing the compensation arrangements for our executive officers, including the CEO, administering our equity compensation plans and reviewing the compensation of the Board. For a description of the Compensation Committee's processes and procedures, including the roles of our executive officers and independent compensation consultants in the Compensation Committee's decision-making process, we refer you to Executive Compensation and Other Proxy Disclosure elsewhere in this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee met nine times in 2018. The F.N.B. Board has affirmatively determined that each member of the Compensation Committee, Directors Hormell, Malone, Motley, Stanik and Strimbu, qualifies under the NYSE, F.N.B. categorical, and Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) compensation committee "independence" rules and as "outside directors" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code).

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists in the development of standards concerning the qualifications and composition of our Board and conducts succession planning for our Board. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends director candidates to stand for election to our Board and seeks to promote the best interests of the Company and its shareholders through implementation of prudent and sound corporate governance principles and practices, including oversight of the Company's corporate responsibility strategies. We refer you to the discussions under Identification and Evaluation of Director Candidates located elsewhere in this proxy statement. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met six times in 2018. 
Risk Committee 
The Risk Committee's principal responsibility is to assist the Board with review and oversight attendant to Company management of its enterprise-wide risk program (see discussion under Risk Oversight later in this proxy statement), including establishing, in consultation with the Chief Risk Officer and senior management, acceptable risk tolerance levels for the Company and reporting this information to the Board. The Risk Committee met seven times in 2018. 
Credit Risk and CRA Committee 
The purpose of the Credit Risk and CRA Committee is to oversee the credit and lending strategies and objectives of FNBPA, including: (i) oversight of credit risk management and strategies, including approval of internal credit policies and establishment of loan portfolio concentration limits; (ii) review of the quality and performance of the Bank's loan portfolio; (iii) approval of intercompany loans subject to Regulation W and loans to Bank "insiders" (as defined under Regulation O) in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements; and (iv) oversight of the Bank's Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) responsibilities, including the monitoring of FNBPA's community lending and investment activities relative to CRA laws and regulations, our CRA Policy, and our community development activities and collaborations with national, regional and local community development organizations. In addition, the Credit Risk and CRA Committee receives reports on our affirmative credit programs and fair lending matters. The Credit Risk and CRA Committee met eight times in 2018. 
The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Credit Risk and CRA Committee, Executive Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Committee each operate under written charters adopted by the Board. You may review these charters on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting the "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance" heading. The principal responsibilities of the Standing Committees described above are qualified by reference to the charters of these committees and relevant sections of our bylaws.

        CEO and Management Succession Planning      
[END TABLE]
Succession planning is a priority for the Board and our senior management, with the goal of ensuring a strong pipeline of leaders for the future. The CEO, in collaboration with his executive management team, regularly reviews the management succession plan for our Chairman/CEO and for key executives and senior management positions on a regular basis and annually consults with the Compensation Committee and the Board, including formal presentations to both regarding the management succession plan. This plan identifies a "readiness" level for internal candidates, leadership capabilities and ranking for internal candidates and incorporates the flexibility to define an external hire as a succession option, particularly for positions where, for example, capability gaps are identified. Our succession planning efforts are a dynamic process which entails regular updates, ongoing evaluations and strategic considerations.

        Board Succession and Refreshment      
[END TABLE]
Our Board's succession planning is continuously focused on the composition of the Board and its committees, upcoming retirements under our director retirement policy, individual director contributions and performance, committee composition and leadership, as well as diversity considerations and recruiting strategies for adding new directors. In its succession planning, the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consider the annual self-assessment results of the Board, committees and individual directors, as well as other appropriate information, including the types of skills and experience desirable for future Board members, and the needs of the Board and its committees at the time, in light of the Company's strategy, business plans, operations and risk profile. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for leading, in collaboration with our Independent Lead Director and Board Chair, our Board succession and refreshment processes. Our Board's succession plan and refreshment practices are the culmination of a thoughtful and methodical process which is informed by our Company's engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders, identification of a diverse pool of candidates using multiple sources, the results of our annual self-evaluation and director nomination processes and the identification of gaps in the Board composition relative to the Company's business operations and risk profile. We believe these actions also maintained an appropriate balance of new perspectives and experience on the Board. Most recently, our Board succession planning and refreshment processes resulted in the addition of two new women to the Board in 2018, including the elevation of one of our female directors to a Board leadership position as Chair of our Risk Committee in 2018.

We also encourage active engagement among the different areas within the Company responsible for our risk management oversight. Since certain of the risk management issues and processes are considered by both our Audit and Risk Committees, our governance structure ensures that appropriate information and knowledge is disseminated between these two committees by having certain interlocking members of both committees, and providing these committees authority to conduct joint sessions to hear reports and discuss key risk management and audit matters affecting our Company.

Each of our business areas is required to ensure that decisions relative to new business initiatives, products and services or material changes to our business model or operations conform to the Company's Statement of Risk Appetite approved by our Board's Risk Committee. Moreover, each of our various lines of business and operations and support areas include appropriate governance processes in considering the limits incorporated into our Risk Appetite Statement, including, but not limited to, policy, risk tolerance limits, key risk indicators, risk and control self-assessments, model valuation, capital planning and stress testing and strategic planning. 
We believe our comprehensive internal risk framework facilitates an appropriate level of risk oversight by our Risk Committee, including such critical features as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Providing that risks are identified, monitored and reported properly;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Defining and measuring the type and amount of risk the Company is willing to take;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Communicating the type and amount of risk taken to the appropriate management level;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintaining a risk management organization that is independent of risk-taking activities. We  incorporate both front-line risk-monitoring at the business level, and a second-line of defense consisting of monitoring oversight by our risk and compliance functions (which are independent of our business operations). In addition, we have an  independent check of both of our first and second-risk management processes through our internal and external audit function; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Promoting a strong risk management culture that encourages a focus on risk-adjusted performance.   
[END TABLE]
Our primary risk exposures, as well as our risk management framework and methodologies, are discussed in further detail on pages 74 and 75 in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also see How We Address Risk and Control within the CD&A for a discussion of risk assessment as it relates to our compensation program. 
The Board believes that the Company's enterprise-wide risk management process is effective since it includes the following material components: (i) enables the Board, Risk Committee, Chief Risk Officer and senior management to properly assess the quality of the information it receives; (ii) enables the Board, the Audit and Risk Committees and senior management to monitor the businesses, investments and financial, technology, cybersecurity, accounting, legal, regulatory and strategic considerations of F.N.B. and its subsidiaries and the risks that they face; (iii) enables the Board and the Audit and Risk Committees to oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk; and (iv) provides the Board and its Audit and Risk Committees appropriate oversight perspective to assess the quality of the Company's enterprise-wide risk management process.

For a detailed discussion of F.N.B.'s corporate values, including environmental, social, governance, employee welfare, community involvement and charitable endeavors, please refer to our 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report which summarizes these important F.N.B. commitments and achievements. The 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report may be found on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us/community-involvement. Our management level Corporate Responsibility Committee is subject to Board oversight through our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
F.N.B. Director Independence Determinations. Our Board has affirmatively determined that 11 of our 12 director-nominees are independent. Our independent director-nominees are current Board members Bena, Campbell, Chiafullo, Dively, Hormell, Malone, Mencini, Motley, Nicholas, Stanik, and Strimbu. In accordance with applicable NYSE "bright-line" independence standards, our CEO, Vincent J. Delie, Jr., is not independent. Stephen J. Gurgovits, who is retiring in accordance with our Board retirement policy, was not independent due to his prior service as our CEO. 
Applicable Standards for Determining Director Independence. As a Company that has securities listed on the NYSE, a majority of the members of our Board must be independent. Under the NYSE's corporate governance standards, no director qualifies as independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that the director has no "material relationship" with F.N.B. The fact that a director or member of a director's immediate family may have a material relationship with F.N.B. directly, or as a partner, owner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with F.N.B., will not necessarily preclude such director from being nominated for election to our Board. In assessing director independence, the Board must consider all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a material relationship exists. In making an affirmative determination as to whether an F.N.B. director qualifies as independent, our Board, with the assistance of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, examines any material relationship which such director has with F.N.B. under the NYSE independence standards and the categorical independence standards that our Board adopted to guide it in evaluating director independence. Generally, the types of material relationships that the Board may consider under the NYSE and F.N.B. independence standards include commercial, legal, industrial, banking, business, consulting, accounting, charitable and family relationships. 
For a director to be considered independent, our Board must determine that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with us. In addition to the applicable NYSE and SEC independence standards, our Board has established standards (which are also included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines found on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance" heading) based on the specified categories and types of transactions, which conform to, or, in part, are more rigorous than, the independence requirements of the NYSE. 
Our Board will also determine that a director is not independent if it finds that the director has material business arrangements with us that could affect that director's judgment. In making this determination, our Board reviews business arrangements between the Company and the director and between any other company for which the director serves as an officer or general partner, or of which the director directly or indirectly owns 2% or more of the equity. Our Board has determined that these arrangements will not be considered material if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• They are of a type that we usually and customarily offer to customers or vendors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• They are on terms substantially similar to those for comparable transactions with other customers  or vendors under similar circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event that the arrangements had not been made or were terminated in the normal course of  business, it is not reasonably likely that there would be a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or business of the recipient.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the case of personal loans, the loans are subject to and in compliance with Regulation O of the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Our Board may also consider other factors as it may deem necessary to arrive at sound determinations as to the independence of each director, and such factors may override the conclusion of independence or non-independence that would be reached simply by reference to the factors listed above. 
In determining that each of the directors, other than Directors Delie and Gurgovits, is independent, our Board reviewed these standards, the corporate governance rules of the NYSE and the SEC, and the individual circumstances of each director. 
The categories or types of transactions, relationships and arrangements discussed below were considered by the Board in determining that a director is independent. None of these transactions, relationships and arrangements rose to the level that would require disclosure under our Related Persons Transactions Policy section, and none of the transactions described below were in an amount that exceeded the greater of $1 million or 2% of the other entity's consolidated gross revenues, which is one of our standards for director independence. 
Our Board determined that none of the transactions, relationships and arrangements constituted a material relationship between our independent director-nominees and our Company or its subsidiaries for the purpose of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE or SEC and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. As such, our Board determined that these transactions, relationships and arrangements did not affect the independence of such director and did not impair such director's ability to act in the shareholders' best interests. 
The following chart reflects business relationships between F.N.B and each independent director, such as a director's spouse and immediate family members (Personal or Family Relationships), and related interests, including a company or charitable organization of which such director or the director's spouse is, or was, during 2018, a partner, officer, director, employee, or in which the director or the director's spouse holds a significant ownership position (Affiliated Entity Relationships). All of these transactions meet our Board guidance on independence (i.e., made in the ordinary course of business, not preferential and fair market value, and involving normal risk of collectability).

Customer Relationships. We provide financial services to most of our directors. We also provide financial services to some of their immediate family members and affiliated entities. We offer these services in the ordinary course of our business. We provide the services on substantially the same terms and conditions, including price, as we provide to other similarly situated customers. 
Credit Relationships. We also extend credit to some of our directors and their immediate family members and affiliated entities. Federal Banking law (Regulation O) governs these extensions of credit. We have incorporated the Regulation O requirements as part of the F.N.B. categorical independence standards. 
Business/Law Firm Relationships. We may also have other business relationships or professional services arrangements with entities affiliated with our directors or their immediate family members. These relationships are in the ordinary course of business. During 2018, the law firm with which Director Chiafullo is associated, provided legal services to F.N.B. or FNBPA and received aggregate legal fees of less than $2,000. Director Chiafullo is not personally involved in providing such legal services. Additionally, Director Chiafullo's law firm frequently represents borrowers in lending transactions and, from time to time, represents borrowers in transactions where FNBPA is a lender. FNBPA Director Chiafullo is not personally involved in providing legal services to these clients and any associated legal fees are paid out of the borrower's loan proceeds, as is customary practice. Under his law firm's procedures, Mr. Chiafullo is restricted from access to information regarding the borrower's transaction with FNBPA and he does not receive any compensation related to such transactions. The Board determined that such relationships are not material. 
Also during 2018, Heeter, a commercial printing Company where Director Bena serves as Vice President of Finance, provided printing services to subsidiaries of F.N.B. and received fees of approximately $560,325, or less than 2% of Heeter's gross revenues for 2018 (0.05% of net revenue). FNBPA has an outstanding aggregate loan relationship of approximately $5.2 million and these loans are performing in accordance with their terms. Heeter is one of five printing vendors employed by F.N.B.'s subsidiaries across their markets and has served as a printing vendor since 2010, pre-dating Director Bena's assumption of her position at Heeter in April 2017. Director Bena does not receive special compensation from Heeter related to the business relationship between F.N.B. and Heeter and was not identified as a potential director-nominee through such business relationship. 
Certain Charitable Contributions. We make contributions to charitable organizations where our directors serve as directors or trustees or have other affiliations with the charity. Such contributions, donations and grants are in accordance with our applicable policies and practices. In 2018, Director Malone served on the Executive Committee of United Way. F.N.B. donated approximately $600,000 to United Way in 2018. F.N.B.'s 2018 donation to the United Way constitutes less than 2% of United Way's consolidated gross receipts for 2018. Also, it should be noted that F.N.B. encourages its employees to donate to United Way and, collectively, F.N.B. employees donated $243,439 to the local United Ways and their partner agencies in 2018. Director Malone did not participate in either F.N.B.'s decision to donate to United Way or otherwise participate in F.N.B.'s campaign to encourage F.N.B. employees to participate in United Way. 
Additional transactions, relationships and arrangements that were considered by the Board are disclosed under Related Person Transactions.

Our Board believes that each director's equity ownership in the Corporation should be aligned with the Corporation's shareholders. Accordingly, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require each of our directors to have beneficial ownership of the lesser of 40,000 shares of Corporation common stock (or common stock equivalent) or $400,000 in value of the Corporation's common stock (or common stock equivalent). The Corporation's director stock ownership requirement is progressively phased in over a six-year period. As of March 6, 2019, each F.N.B. director is in compliance with the stock ownership requirement. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR BOARD

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) requires our executive officers and directors, as well as certain persons who beneficially own 10% or more of our common stock, to file reports of their ownership of our securities, as well as statements of changes in such ownership, with the SEC. To our knowledge, based solely on written representations received from our executive officers and directors and copies of the statements of ownership changes furnished to us by our executive officers and directors during 2018, we believe that all such filings required during 2018 were made on a timely basis except for a late filing by Director Bena due to an administrative oversight of her broker, and a late filing by Director Mencini due to an inadvertent administrative oversight of by the administrative person responsible for filing his Form 4. We do not have any shareholders who own 10% or more of our common stock who are required to file reports under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
We have adopted a written policy formalizing the manner in which we review a proposed transaction involving the Company and any of our directors, any director-nominees, any executive officers, any 5% or greater shareholder or any immediate family member of the foregoing (related persons) because of the possibility of a conflict of interest. A copy of this "Policy with Respect to Related Person Transactions" is posted on our website at www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting the "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance" heading. Under our policy, all proposed related person transactions except for (i) transactions generally available to all employees or shareholders of the Company, and (ii) compensatory transactions consistent with the plans, policies and decisions approved by the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, must receive the prior approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board before we can take part in the transaction, and if such transaction continues for more than one year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board must annually approve the transaction. For purposes of this policy, a related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries was, is or will be a participant, and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The category of related persons generally consists of the Company's Directors, director-nominees and executive officers, holders of 5% or more of the Company's common stock, immediate family members of the foregoing persons and any entity owned or controlled by the foregoing persons. 
Mr. Gurgovits' son is the former employee and managing director of F.N.B. Capital Corporation, LLC (F.N.B. Capital), a merchant banking subsidiary of the Corporation. Due to the uncertainty as to whether the F.N.B. Capital investment activities would continue to be permissible under the final Dodd-Frank Volcker rules, Mr. Gurgovits' son, along with the other F.N.B. Capital principals, resigned from F.N.B. Capital effective July 31, 2013. Mr. Gurgovits' son and his fellow principals established a new Company called Tecum Capital Partners, as a Small Business Investment Company licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBIC Fund) in 2013. Mr. Gurgovits' son and the other principals are the sole owners of Tecum Capital Management (Tecum), the general partner of the SBIC Fund. In view of the detailed knowledge and experience that the Tecum principals had with respect to the F.N.B. Capital investment portfolio, F.N.B. Capital entered into an asset management agreement whereby Tecum manages the F.N.B. Capital investment portfolio for a quarterly fee based on the amount of assets under management. The economics and terms of the asset management arrangement were agreed to pursuant to an arms-length negotiation between F.N.B. Capital and Tecum. In 2018, F.N.B. Capital made total payments to Tecum of approximately $15,000 in fees pursuant to terms of the asset management advisory arrangement. 
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, as anchor investor, F.N.B. committed to invest an aggregate amount of $14,700,000 (representing a 21.5% equity interest) in the SBIC Fund, subject to the same material terms and conditions as those of other co-investors in the SBIC Fund. The SBIC Fund has 61 co-investors, including six non-affiliated bank investors. The total commitment of all investors in the SBIC Fund is $66.9 million. Director Gurgovits has a 0.75% equity investment commitment (equivalent to $500,000) in the SBIC Fund. Director Gurgovits is on the SBIC Fund Board of Advisors and is on its Investment Committee. F.N.B. had a net book value in the fund as of December 31, 2018, of $17,741,912 after investing $12,191,054 into the SBIC Fund (leaving a remaining unfunded capital call commitment of $2,508,946). 
Director Gurgovits and members of his immediate family also have co-invested an aggregate of $140,000 in a portfolio Company of F.N.B. Capital on the same terms negotiated by F.N.B. Capital. 
Also during 2018, Heeter, the commercial printing Company where Director Bena serves as Vice President of Finance, provided printing services to subsidiaries of F.N.B. and received fees of approximately $560,325 or less than 2% of Heeter's gross revenues for 2018. Also, as described in the table titled, Personal, Family and Affiliated Entity Relationships of F.N.B. Director-Nominees set forth in the Director Independence discussion in this proxy statement, FNBPA has an outstanding credit relationship with Heeter. 
In the ordinary course of our business, we have engaged and expect to continue engaging in ordinary banking transactions with our directors, executive officers, their immediate family members and entities in which they hold a position or ownership interest, including loans to such persons. Any loan to those persons or entities was made, in a material respect, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time such loan was made as loans made to persons who were not related to us. These loans do not involve more than the normal credit collection risk and do not present any other unfavorable features.

[END TABLE]
The members of the Compensation Committee (Committee) during 2018 were Directors Hormell, Malone, Motley, Stanik and Strimbu. Mr. Strimbu joined the Committee in May 2018. Neither we nor FNBPA have ever employed any member of the Committee. No such member has, during our last fiscal year, any relationship with us requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K or under the Compensation Committee Interlocks disclosure requirements of Item 407(e)(4) of Regulation S-K. We have determined that the Committee members are independent under the NYSE corporate governance standards and are non-employees under the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Our Board has delegated to the Committee the responsibility of setting the compensation of our directors, CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Section 16 officers. The Committee met nine times in 2018. 
Authority and Responsibilities 
The Committee administers our executive compensation programs, including the oversight of executive compensation policies and decisions, administration of our equity incentive plan and the annual cash incentive award plan applicable to Section 16 officers. The Committee administers and interprets our qualified and non-qualified benefit plans, establishes guidelines, approves participants in the non-qualified plans, approves grants and awards, and exercises other power and authority required and permitted under the plans and its Charter. The Committee also reviews and approves executive officer, including CEO, compensation, including, as applicable, salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentive compensation levels, perquisites and equity compensation. The Committee Charter reflects its responsibilities and the Committee reviews the Charter annually and recommends any proposed changes to the Board. A copy of the Committee Charter is available at our website, at www.fnb-online.com/about-us, selecting the "Investor Relations and Shareholder Services" option and scrolling to the "Corporate Governance" heading. 
Delegation 
From time to time, and subject to statutory and regulatory limitations, the Committee may delegate authority to fulfill various functions of administering the Company's plans to our employees. Currently, it delegates administration of our qualified plans to the Pension Committee, a committee of our senior officers who have the appropriate expertise, experience and background in handling defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 
Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, McLagan, an Aon company, to assist with evaluating our compensation practices and to provide ongoing advice and recommendations regarding CEO, NEO and director compensation that are consistent with our business goals and pay philosophy. The Committee selected the Consultant for, among other reasons, its reputation for providing comprehensive solutions to complex compensation challenges facing companies and specific expertise in the financial services industry. In addition to McLagan, another Aon company, Radford, provided accounting services to us related to our LTIP. The Committee has reviewed all services provided by McLagan in 2018 and has determined that they are independent with respect to NYSE and SEC standards. 
McLagan reported directly to the Chairman of the Committee, and interacted with our CEO, CFO, Executive Vice President, Human Resources and other employees in performance of its duties. Additionally, the CEO regularly attended Committee meetings and discussed with McLagan and the Committee members, both during meetings and outside meetings, the appropriate base salary and short-term and long-term compensation for the other Section 16 officers. The CFO regularly attended meetings of the Committee to discuss Company performance relative to the short-term and long-term plans versus peers. In addition, McLagan communicated with, took direction from and regularly interacted with the Chairman of the Committee and other members of the Committee in addition to attending Committee meetings on an as-needed basis.

[END TABLE]
The generation of record earnings of $365 million and return of over $165 million in dividends directly to shareholders are leading indicators of why the F.N.B. Board of Directors has a high degree of trust and confidence in the management team. During the past 10 years, F.N.B. embarked on a strategy that focused on creating long-term shareholder value. This strategy has transformed an $8 billion financial services company serving smaller markets with a limited product and service offerings into a $33 billion financial enterprise operating in dynamic and diverse growth metropolitan markets in seven states and the District of Columbia, which offer products and services that are as diverse and competitive as those offered by the largest financial institutions in the U.S. During the second half of 2018, we created additional operating leverage through disciplined expense management while also investing in technology, infrastructure, and our people, all of which positions the Company for a successful 2019 and beyond. Our commitment to driving organic growth, focusing on improving efficiency, and building a strong and differentiated brand, creates incremental, sustainable value for all of our constituencies, including our shareholders. 
The financial results in 2018 are a clear result of a multi-year business strategy that is supported by the Board of Directors. The Board acknowledges that management has executed on the business strategy which is best seen through 2018 results. As an example, and as shown below, ROATCE is in the top quartile of the Company's peers on either a reported or operating basis for 2018. This reflects the positive financial returns that F.N.B. has produced by implementing its long-term strategic plan.

   Compensation Discussion and Analysis     
[END TABLE]
It is important to note that while management has executed on the business strategy in a challenging economic, regulatory and political environment, we acknowledge that the TSR has not been at the level we desire. While management has successfully executed our business plan as demonstrated by top quartile ROATCE results and strong results in other financial metrics, the NEOs and other senior management long-term incentive awards have failed to vest or are not on track to vest as a result of lower than expected shareholder returns. The values reported in the Summary Compensation Table compared to what has actually been realized by management show an appropriate and ongoing pay for performance approach that is fully aligned with shareholder interests. Based on a desire to improve our TSR and respond to investor feedback on our long-term incentive design, we have added ROATA as the primary long-term incentive metric, and retained TSR as a modifying metric to align with shareholder interests. Return on tangible asset measures are foundational to banking and are one of the metrics of financial performance correlated with long-term success of a firm. Over time, we will continue to review the performance metrics we use and we expect our use of them to evolve as appropriate. 
We have designed our compensation programs to align our corporate performance and strategic goals with our executive's total compensation opportunities. In doing so, we seek to ensure that we are being competitive in attracting and retaining the appropriate executive talent, while maintaining good corporate governance practices and aligning management interests with those of our shareholders. 
Say-on-Pay Support  and Investor Engagement 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our say-on-pay proposal received approximately 72% support from our shareholders. After receiving such strong support in the prior year (over 96%), our Committee was disappointed in the 2018 outcome, but it was determined to better understand the factors that drove these results by soliciting input and feedback in connection with our annual shareholder and proxy advisory firm outreach process. In 2018, we reached out to 26 of our top investors, which represented approximately 56% of our shares owned at that time, as well as a leading proxy advisory firm, to discuss executive compensation and governance matters.

Summary of 2018 Executive Compensation Actions 
Consistent with our philosophy of tying pay to performance, we highlight the following key compensation actions for 2018: 
Salaries 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increases: In 2018, base salaries for each of our named executive officers increased  approximately 2.5% over the prior year to position salaries closer to the median of our Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
EIC Plan 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target Incentive Opportunity - For each NEO, target short-term incentive opportunity  remained the same as 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Metrics: Incentive payouts for 2018 performance were based on Operating EPS vs.  budget, operating ROATCE vs. peers, and operating Efficiency Ratio vs. peers. We believe these measures closely align our annual performance goals and shareholder interests, support our long-term expectations and properly reward management.

• Performance Results Relative to Peers: The following chart shows how our 2018 performance  for ROATCE and Efficiency Ratio compared to peers. Operating EPS is not included in the chart as it is an absolute measure which is compared to the annual operating budget set by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, it is important to note that ROATCE and the Efficiency Ratio are both above the 75th percentile of peers and that we delivered better than plan performance relative to Operating EPS growth. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payout: Based on our performance, we paid executives short-term cash incentives under the  plan at 151.87% of target.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target Incentive Opportunity: For each NEO, target long-term incentive opportunity remained  the same as 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Plan Structure: We granted our executives equity based on a predefined matrix defining  grant values as a percentage of salary. We delivered a majority of the executives' target long-term incentive (LTI) value in performance-based RSUs (67%) and the remainder in time-based RSUs (33%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Metric: TSR as a long-term incentive measure provides a peer comparison that  aligns executives with the shareholders. However, after shareholder outreach sessions and an analysis of peer practices, the 2018 awards incorporated a new metric, making performance-based equity subject to both ROATA and TSR. This change is  discussed in more detail in the Long-Term Awards section below. We believe, as long-term measures, ROATA and TSR provide for a good peer comparison that balances both financial return as well as delivering shareholder value.

[END TABLE]
This is the first year of a three-year performance cycle for the 2018 LTI award. Accordingly, approximately one third into the performance cycle, ROATA is slightly below peer median and TSR is in the second quartile. 
Target Pay Mix 
The Committee believes that a significant portion of compensation should be contingent on our performance. We also believe that a large portion of compensation should be long-term in nature and align the management team with shareholders. For this reason, Mr. Delie's target direct compensation is made up of 60% performance-based compensation and 58% long-term compensation.

Key Compensation Governance Highlights 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Stock Ownership Policy    Our directors and certain senior level managers who participate  in the LTIP, including our NEOs, are currently in compliance with our stock ownership policy. 
 Anti-Hedging Policy    Our anti-hedging policy prohibits our directors, NEOs, and  executive officers from engaging in hedging transactions with Company stock. 
 Clawback Policy    Our compensation recoupment or clawback policy allows our Board  to recoup any excess compensation, whether in the form of cash or equity, paid to our NEOs if the Company restates its financial results upon which an award is based due to fraud, intentional misconduct or gross negligence. 
 Risk Assessment    We annually conduct a risk assessment of all of our compensation  plans, and the Committee annually reviews the assessment to ensure the compensation programs do not encourage inappropriate risk taking. 
 Tax  Gross-Ups    Our Board adopted a policy that we will not permit tax gross-up payments 
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DETERMINATION PROCESS 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
We believe strongly that compensation should be rooted in pay-for-performance philosophy. It is the goal of the Committee to reward long-term results that are aligned with shareholder interests by regularly evaluating our NEO compensation programs for both reasonableness and competitiveness to market and to ensure we attract and retain top talent. In addition, the Committee evaluates Board of Director compensation with assistance from its independent compensation consultant as highlighted below. The Committee also reviews the Company's LTIP, risk factors for the Company's performance plans and other factors as highlighted in the Compensation Committee's Charter. 
Role of Independent Consultant 
The Committee selected McLagan to provide advisory assistance during 2018. During the course of 2018, the Compensation Committee directed McLagan to assist with benchmarking its board of director and executive officer compensation. In addition, McLagan assisted with the review of the LTIP, proxy development and other requests as directed by the Committee. 
The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the compensation consultant's independence and performance under the applicable NYSE listing standards. The Committee believes that working with an independent compensation consultant furthers the Company's objectives to recruit and retain qualified executives, align their interests with those of shareholders and ensure that their compensation packages will appropriately motivate and reward ongoing achievement of business goals. In 2018, the Committee determined that McLagan continued to be independent under applicable NYSE listing standards and retained them to advise the Committee with respect to compensation of the CEO and other executive officers. 
Use of Market-Based Comparisons 
We desire our compensation programs to be competitive in the marketplace. With the assistance of McLagan, we identified 19 comparable U.S. commercial banks with assets ranging from $21 billion to $80 billion (as of the time of Peer Group selection in mid-2017 for 2018 compensation decision making).

[END TABLE]
The following companies constituted our 2018 Peer Group (dollars in thousands): 
We compete for talent with the institutions in our Peer Group, as well as large financial institutions in our geographic markets. As we continue to grow, we continue to add talent from large financial institutions with which we compete in many metropolitan markets. We believe the Peer Group is diverse and provides the necessary depth to be meaningful in setting salary and incentive goals and is an appropriate group from which to benchmark our compensation. 
The Committee uses competitive compensation data from the annual total compensation study of peer companies to support its decisions about overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements. Additionally, the Committee uses multiple reference points when establishing targeted compensation levels. The Committee does not benchmark specific compensation elements or total compensation to any specific percentile relative to the peer companies or the broader U.S. market. Instead, the Committee applies judgment and discretion in establishing targeted pay levels, taking into account not only competitive market data, but also factors such as Company, business and individual performance, scope of responsibility, critical needs and skill sets, leadership potential and succession planning.

        Compensation Philosophy and Objectives        
[END TABLE]
During 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed and determined it was appropriate to continue the formal executive compensation philosophy it adopted in 2015 to guide future compensation decisions. The overall goal of our compensation program is to pay within a reasonable range of the median for relative peer median performance, below median pay for below relative peer median performance and above median pay for above relative peer median performance, all while considering the skills and experience of each of our NEOs. We believe it is important to continually monitor our peers' compensation practices and plan designs, and all aspects of our performance metrics, paying particular attention to financial measures and strategic objectives, including successful transactions and other capital actions. 
The following table shows why we pay each component and how we intend to position our compensation relative to our Peer Group. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Salary     We provide base salary to all salaried employees, including the  NEOs, in order to provide each employee with a degree of financial certainty. Competitive base salaries further our compensation program objectives by allowing us to attract and retain talented employees by providing a fixed portion of compensation  upon which all employees can rely. 
 Annual EIC Plan     We believe that a significant amount of our NEOs'  compensation should be contingent on our performance. Our annual incentive plan focuses on our Operating EPS, ROATCE and Efficiency Ratio. We believe a focus on those metrics will increase our TSR. By paying a portion of the NEOs' total  compensation in variable incentive pay, we expect to drive our annual performance while increasing long-term shareholder value. 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan     We believe providing performance-based (2/3 of total equity) and  time-based (1/3 of total equity) RSUs is an effective means of promoting long-term stock ownership by NEOs and rewards management for creating long-term shareholder value. We also believe that placing a significant portion of an executive's  compensation in stock, through RSUs, causes executives to focus on long-term performance resulting in risk mitigation and clearly aligns management and shareholder interests. 
 Direct Compensation     Includes salary, annual incentive plan payouts, and LTIP payouts.  To maintain a strong link between pay and performance, we place more weight on performance-based incentives. 
 Other Benefits and Perquisites     We do not have an active supplemental executive retirement plan  (SERP) or pension, and instead promote performance-based compensation. Other perquisites are intended to be in line with market practice, including health and welfare benefits on the same basis as our general employee  population.

The various components of the NEOs' total compensation are detailed below. 
Base Salary 
Each year the Committee reviews salaries and determines adjustments to each NEO's base salary based upon an assessment of the performance of the NEO's job responsibilities, including the impact of such performance and contributions on our financial results. In certain cases, the Committee increases base salary to raise the NEO's annual salary to reflect more closely the annual salaries of comparably performing Peer Group executives. Typically, we preliminarily review the compensation levels of the CEO and other NEOs in the last quarter of the year to evaluate compensation for the upcoming year, including potential salary adjustments. Accordingly, the Committee increased each of the NEOs' salaries to remain within a reasonable range of the median of the Peer Group and set their 2018 salaries as noted in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Vincent J. Delie, Jr.   $1,050,000   $1,076,000   2.5%

 Barry C. Robinson   $375,000   $384,000   2.4% 
[END TABLE]
Annual Incentive Awards 
We intend our EIC Plan to provide additional compensation to our NEOs in the form of performance-based awards that are based on our achievement of certain annual financial objectives. We target short-term, annual incentive compensation of the CEO and the other NEOs such that their compensation is tied directly to the Company's performance. We measure our annual performance against three weighted target goals set by the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating EPS – 70%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ROATCE – 20%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Efficiency Ratio – 10%.  
[END TABLE]
We believe these performance goals are critical to F.N.B.'s growth and profitability, as well as contributors to the long-term creation and preservation of shareholder value. In evaluating performance, the Committee considers in the calculation items not in the normal course of annual operations and their resulting effect on our performance (i.e. significant merger and acquisition transactions, investment gains or losses, corporate and balance sheet restructuring, significant asset sales and other items it deems appropriate in measuring our performance against the target goal). We set the target incentive award level for each NEO based upon market-competitive incentive opportunities as provided by McLagan for executives performing similar duties, and the Committee has the sole discretion to determine all annual bonuses for the CEO and other NEOs. 
2018 Performance Goals 
Our 2018 performance goals are reflected in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Operating EPS vs. Operating Budget   70%    $1.004 (90% Budget)    $1.115 (100% Budget)    $1.227 (110% Budget)

[END TABLE]
We calculate performance for each specific key performance measurement independently to determine the payout for that key performance measurement. The sum of the awards for each key performance measurement determines the total incentive award.

Long-Term Awards 
F.N.B. believes a large portion of an executive's pay package should align executive interests with those of shareholders. As such, we have annually granted our executives a mix of time-based and performance-based RSUs. These grants reward NEOs based on the Company's achievement of certain financial objectives, in the case of performance-based awards, and assist with the retention of key executives.

In 2018, long-term incentive awards were divided into two components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 67% performance-based awards (Performance-Based Awards) and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 33% time-based awards (Time-Based Awards).  
[END TABLE]
We believe this allocation of equity awards is appropriate to reward NEOs for loyalty to the Company, encourage stock ownership, provide increased ownership and retain our key executives. The Performance-Based Awards help drive our performance, while creating shareholder value by linking the shareholders' interests and the NEOs' interests in long-term success. The NEO will forfeit both types of awards if the NEO terminates employment before the cliff vesting date, other than as a result of retirement, death or disability. 
Our Compensation Committee establishes a target award level for each NEO based upon the executive officer's level of responsibility and sets the levels such that the award amount increases as the officer's level of responsibility in the organization increases. At the time of granting the awards, the Committee sets the award amount for each participant level in a manner designed to provide competitive long-term compensation based on data provided by McLagan as market-competitive incentive opportunities for executives performing similar duties. The targets for 2018 were the same as 2017 and are as set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Name     LTI Plan Opportunity  (% of Salary)   
  Name     LTI Plan Opportunity  (% of Salary)

 Gary L.  Guerrieri      75%           
 Robert M.  Moorehead      75%           
 Barry C.  Robinson      75%           
[END TABLE]
The following table shows the target value of the 2018 grants for each of the NEOs. These awards will not vest until 2021 and the Performance-Based Awards only vest if our performance meets the requirements set forth in the awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Vincent J.  Delie, Jr.     1,973,133       958,727   
 Vincent J.  Calabrese, Jr.     584,774       284,132

 Barry C.  Robinson     195,604       95,048   
[END TABLE]
In setting target levels, we also believe it is appropriate to understand the ownership levels of our NEOs that resulted from prior award grants and the ultimate vested amount of stock, including our NEOs ownership levels as compared to peers. We periodically conduct a review of the ownership levels of our NEOs compared to peers and their overall ownership levels. Our most recent analysis indicates that our NEOs as a group, and our CEO and CFO individually, are in the bottom quartile of stock ownership compared to our peers despite our continued strong growth in total revenue, net income, earnings per share and tangible book value per common share.

Performance-Based Awards 
Our 2018 Performance-Based Awards are designed to align management's long-term incentive compensation with our financial performance as measured through ROATA over a three-year performance period. These awards will not vest and the NEOs will not receive any shares or payment if the minimum relative ROATA performance is not achieved. If the ROATA performance criteria discussed below is achieved, the number of Performance-Based Awards that vest is adjusted to reflect the degree of achievement upon relative TSR compared to a group of peer financial institutions. The combination of these two metrics provides for a balanced set of goals which measure and reward using both a financial measure (ROATA) and a shareholder measure (TSR) over a three-year performance period. 
First, the Company's financial performance goals are based on our relative ROATA during a three-year performance period versus our Peer Group, and set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Threshold    25th Percentile    25% of Target 
 Target    50th Percentile    100% of Target 
 Maximum    75th Percentile    175% of Target 
[END TABLE]
Second, after determining the award level based on ROATA, the award may be adjusted plus or minus 25% based on our TSR performance versus peers. TSR performance at peer median results in no adjustment to the award. If our performance is at or below the 25th percentile, the award is adjusted downward 25%. If performance is at or above the 75th percentile, the award is adjusted upward 25%. For both ROATA and TSR, there is interpolation between all performance levels. 
We believe the size of the Peer Group (19) is large enough to reduce potential volatility that may result when peer financial institutions are acquired during the three-year performance period and, therefore, are unavailable for measurement comparison purposes. We expect the Peer Group to provide a meaningful comparison based upon our current asset size and anticipated growth over the award performance period. 
Performance of our Past Performance-Based Awards 
Over the last several award cycles (2014-2017), executives received performance-based awards based exclusively on our relative TSR performance versus our peers. Since our TSR underperformed our peers over these performance periods, our Performance-Based Awards have not vested, including the 2015 grants whose performance period ended in 2018. We believe that examining our awards through this lens is one way to see our pay-for-performance philosophy in action. 
The reported pay values that are described pursuant to the rules governing disclosures in this proxy statement as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards tables that follow the CD&A herewith are significantly different (higher) than what our executives actually received or are currently on track to receive in the future. As an example of this, the following table shows the Performance-Based Award grants made to our CEO in the past three performance periods. These are Performance-Based shares with a cumulative

 grant date value of $3,860,294 reported in the tables that the CEO did not earn, or that are likely not to be earned, due to the TSR being below the threshold for payment during these performance periods, thus reducing the actual compensation realized from what is disclosed in those tables.

        Additional Compensation Policies and Practices        
        Additional Compensation Policies and Practices        
[END TABLE]
Management Stock Ownership Policy 
We maintain a Management Stock Ownership Policy that requires the CEO, the other NEOs and certain senior management who participate in the LTIP, the 2007 Plan, and any successor plan to have varying levels of stock ownership based upon the officer's participation level in the plan. The policy requires participants to hold the lesser of a specific share amount or a number of shares equal to a specific dollar threshold that is a multiple of the participant's salary. We believe that this policy aligns management and shareholder interests and acts as a risk mitigant because our NEOs have a significant long-term stake in our success. Under our policy, acceptable forms of stock ownership include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares owned individually and by immediate family  
• long-term stock awards, including all restricted stock and unit awards   
• shares held in the 401(k) Plan  
[END TABLE]
Specific ownership guidelines for the NEOs are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Vincent J. Delie, Jr.   5 x salary     250,000        met   
 Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.   3 x salary     100,000        met   
 Gary L. Guerrieri   3 x salary     100,000        met   
 Robert M. Moorehead   3 x salary     100,000        met   
 Barry C. Robinson   3 x salary     100,000        met   
[END TABLE]
We annually review progress toward achieving the ownership guidelines. Our NEOs are required to reach the stock ownership guidelines within five years after the later of any of the following events: commencement of participation in the long-term incentive portion of the 2007 Plan; promotion to a higher participation level; or, we increase a participant's ownership requirement. If an NEO does not hold the required share amount after the five-year period, the NEO will receive any future incentive awards as stock, in lieu of cash, that the participant must hold until he or she reaches the applicable required ownership level. All of our NEOs currently meet the required stock ownership levels based on prior policies and are within the time period allotted to achieve the level required under our current stock ownership guidelines. 
Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
All employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) Plan. All salaried employees hired before January 1, 2008, except employees of First National Insurance Agency, LLC (FNIA), participated in our defined benefit pension plan, the Retirement Income Plan (RIP), through December 31, 2010. At that time, we froze each participant's accrued benefit amount and ceased future accruals.

[END TABLE]
In general, we have designed our retirement plans to provide NEOs and other employees with financial security after retirement. We provide matching contributions and a performance-based contribution under the 401(k) Plan for all employees, including the NEOs. Previously, we offered a defined benefit pension plan, the RIP. We detail its benefits to employees more particularly in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Pension Benefits table. Additionally, due to Code limits on the amount of compensation that may be recognized for tax-qualified retirement plans, certain NEOswere unable to make the full amount of contributions to the 401(k) Plan and the amount of their total pay that is included in the calculation of their pension benefit is limited. Therefore, we offered the F.N.B. Corporation ERISA Excess Retirement Plan (Excess Plan) and continue to offer the F.N.B. Corporation ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan to allow any affected employee, including the NEO's, to receive the full benefit intended by the qualified retirement plans. In 2010, we amended the Excess Plan consistent with the amendments to the RIP. 
In addition to those plans, we previously provided to some senior executives, including Mr. Guerrieri, a supplemental executive retirement plan, called the Basic Retirement Plan (BRP), which is designed to supplement the benefits provided by the RIP and the Excess Plan. The purpose of the BRP was to ensure a minimum level of retirement income for the NEOs and other senior officers who participated in the plan. We closed the BRP to new participants and ceased future accruals for all participants, effective December 31, 2008. 
Post-Employment and Change in Control Payments 
We believe post-retirement compensation is necessary to attract and retain talented executives and that our post-retirement benefits are competitive in the industry and provide NEOs with appropriate retirement benefits. 
We provide severance and change in control payments through employment contracts that provide additional security for our NEOs. We determined that the continued retention of the services of our NEOs on a long-term basis fosters stability of senior management through retention of well-qualified officers. The 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables and accompanying narrative detail the NEOs' employment contracts. 
The RIP benefit is determined by a precise formula set forth in the plan document and explained in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Pension Benefits table. The ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan and Excess Plan benefit formulas are based upon the specific opportunity or the amounts lost by the participant due to Code limits and are more fully detailed in the 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation and 2018 Pension Benefits tables and narratives. The benefit under the BRP is a monthly benefit equal to a target benefit percentage based on years of service at retirement and a designated tier as determined by the Committee and detailed in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Pension Benefits table. We do not grant extra years of credited service under any of our qualified or non-qualified plans. The termination and change in control benefits for NEOs were set by contract and are described more fully in the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables and in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
Other Benefits and Perquisites 
The NEOs participate in a wide array of benefit plans that are generally available to all employees of the Company, including the RIP* and the 401(k) Plan. Benefits primarily consist of participation in the Company's defined benefit, defined contribution and health and welfare benefit plans. In addition, some of the NEOs receive perquisites in the form of club membership dues, a company car and other perquisites detailed as part of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and accompanying narrative. We provide club membership dues to certain NEOs in order to provide them with the ability to engage in business development activities, including entertaining customers, potential customers and various business, community and political contacts, which is an integral part of our industry. Similarly, we provide certain NEOs a company car for purposes of appropriate transportation for entertainment of customers, vendors and business contacts and traveling between our facilities. It is the Committee's policy that it will not include tax gross-ups in any new or amended employment agreements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  As noted in the Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits section, we closed the RIP to employees hired  after December 31, 2007, and froze all benefits for all participants effective December 31, 2010.

Tax and Accounting Treatment of Compensation 
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (Tax Act) which included significant changes to the executive compensation deduction rules in Section 162(m) of the Code. The Tax Act changed the scope of the employees covered by Section 162(m) of the Code and limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of one million dollars paid to the CEO, CFO and the other three most highly compensated executive officers. The Tax Act eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that "grandfathers" certain awards or arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017. We intended for Performance-Based Awards of RSUs and annual incentive compensation granted under our 2007 Plan granted prior to the effective date of the Tax Act, to meet the performance-based compensation exception to the annual million dollar limitation. However, there can be no assurance that any amounts paid will be deductible under Section 162(m). While we are cognizant of the tax deduction limitations applicable to our compensation program for NEOs, we may set compensation levels or structure arrangements outside the deduction limitations if we deem the amount of compensation appropriate. The Committee has the discretion to establish the compensation paid, or intended to be paid or awarded to the NEOs, as the Committee may determine is in our and our shareholders' best interests. This is an important feature of our compensation practices because it provides the Committee with sufficient flexibility to respond to specific situations we encounter. 
In addition, Section 409A of the Code provides for an additional tax on executives with respect to various features of deferred compensation arrangements. We have made the appropriate changes to our non-qualified retirement plans and employment agreements to help to ensure compliance with Code Section 409A and to attempt to avoid adverse impacts on F.N.B. or its executive officers as a result of Section 409A. We do not expect these changes to have a material tax or financial effect on us. 
As discussed above, we have calculated and discussed with the Committee the tax impact to us and the executives of each of our cash and equity compensation awards and agreements. We also calculate and monitor the accounting expense related to equity-based compensation using the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation.

(1)  Payments under the Company's annual incentive plan for 2018 are reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column instead of in the Bonus column, in accordance with SEC requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The restricted stock award amounts shown in this table represent the dollar amount of awards  granted during the fiscal year determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718. The actual amount that will vest in future years is uncertain. Assumptions used in the calculation of this amount are included in Note 16 to the Company's audited financial  statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019. The restricted stock awards granted under  the 2007 Plan vest either after (i) the NEO's continued employment with the Company or one of its affiliates for three years or (ii) the Company's achievement of performance goals and the NEO's continued employment with the  Company or one of its affiliates for three years. We issued Time-Based Awards and Performance-Based Awards in RSUs. The RSUs earn dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same restrictions and vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs. The  amounts reflected in the table assume that each NEO will perform the requisite service and we will achieve the required performance goals at target levels. The actual performance cannot be determined for three years and could be zero. For 2018, the  grant date fair values of Performance-Based Awards were: Mr. Delie, $1,973,133; Mr. Calabrese, $584,774; Mr. Guerrieri, $229,743; Mr. Moorehead, $222,091; and Mr. Robinson, $195,604. At the maximum level of performance, the  performance-based awards would be: Mr. Delie, $4,316,227; Mr. Calabrese, $1,279,187; Mr. Guerrieri, $502,568; Mr. Moorehead, $485,825; and Mr. Robinson, $427,880. The amount for Mr. Delie also includes stock awards  valued at $55,026 for service as a director in 2018 that vested immediately upon grant. (See narrative under the Director Compensation discussion of this proxy statement.)  
[END TABLE]

(3)  Amount earned by the NEO as an annual incentive bonus under our EIC Plan, based upon the  Company's performance. The EIC Plan is discussed in further detail in the CD&A under the heading Annual Incentive Awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The amounts in this column reflect the actuarial change in the present value of the NEO's  benefit under all of our pension plans determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our financial statements and include amounts that the NEO may not currently be entitled to receive because such  amounts are not vested. Our pension plans are described in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Pension Benefits table. Note that the change in values for 2018 for Messrs. Delie, Calabrese and Guerrieri was actually a decrease of $15,731,  $7,591 and $59,246, respectively. However, based on the SEC's interpretive guidance, the amount shown in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table should not be less than $0. Therefore, the amount shown above for Messrs. Delie, Calabrese and  Guerrieri is shown as $0. We do not pay or provide above-market interest under Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  The dollar amount of the perquisite or other personal benefits represents the incremental cost to  us of providing the benefit. This column includes the costs of social club dues for Messrs. Delie, Calabrese, Guerrieri and Moorehead; personal financial planning for Messrs. Delie and Calabrese; executive physical for Mr. Guerrieri; personal  use of company-provided automobiles for Messrs. Delie, Calabrese, Guerrieri and Robinson; parking fees for Messrs. Delie, Calabrese, Guerrieri and Moorehead; and personal use of corporate aircraft for Mr. Delie. The incremental cost of  Mr. Delie's use of the aircraft in 2018 was $65,308. The valuation of the Company provided automobiles was calculated as our current year depreciation or leasing expense for the automobile plus all costs incurred related to the automobile  (including, but not limited to, the cost of insurance, gas, car washes, repairs, registration and inspection fees), less our mileage reimbursement allowance for business miles driven by employees who use their own automobile for business purposes.  Because our Compensation Committee has a strong preference for our CEO to take all of his flights on the corporate aircraft (personal and business), our Compensation Committee amended our Aircraft Usage Policy to authorize our CEO to use the  aircraft for personal travel during times when it is not being used for business travel. In authorizing such personal usage, our Compensation Committee considered the advantages that personal aircraft usage offers the Company, including mitigating  security risks and encouraging reduced travel time, thereby promoting the CEO's availability, efficiency and productivity. Our Aircraft Usage Policy contains procedures to document the principles to be applied in determining the classification  of a flight as business or personal and the calculation of the aggregate incremental cost for perquisite purposes, including definitions of personal use and enhanced methodologies for allocating cost between business and personal use in complex  travel circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   In view of our certain operational restrictions and administrative efficiencies, we operate our  corporate aircraft under Federal Aviation Administration rules and regulations that limit our ability to accept reimbursement for personal flights on our aircraft. The incremental cost to F.N.B. for personal aircraft use is calculated by multiplying  the total number of personal flight hours by the total variable cost and dividing that number by the total passenger miles for 2018. The total variable cost includes costs related to maintenance, crew expenses, pro rata cost of extra fuel due to  additional weight, meals, beverages, landing fees and ground transportation services. Since the aircraft is used primarily for business travel, total variable cost does not include the calculation of fixed costs that do not change based on  particular usage, such as crew salaries, insurance, aircraft management services, hangar rental, capital improvement costs intended to cover a multi-year period, and other fixed costs not affected by the presence of additional passengers.   
[END TABLE]

(b)  This amount reflects Company contributions during the year to the ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan as  more fully described in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table.

The foregoing 2018 Summary Compensation Table does not include certain fringe benefits generally made available on a non-discriminatory basis to all of our salaried employees such as group health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and long-term disability insurance, which we consider to be ordinary and incidental business costs and expenses. 
In 2010, the Committee made a policy decision not to provide tax gross-ups in any new or amended employment agreements. 
Mr. Delie became CEO in 2012 and entered into his employment agreement with us and FNBPA on December 15, 2010. Mr. Delie's contract has an initial term of three years and, unless sooner terminated, automatically extends for one year on the anniversary of the commencement date such that, on the anniversary date, the contract has a three-year term. Either party may terminate the automatic renewal provision by providing the other party with 30 days' advance written notice of non-renewal prior to the anniversary of the commencement date. Currently, Mr. Delie's employment agreement runs through December 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Delie is entitled to receive a base salary that may be increased from time to time as determined by the Committee. Additionally, in 2018, Mr. Delie was eligible to participate in our annual incentive compensation plan at a target award level of 100% of his base salary. Thus, he had the possibility of achieving a bonus between 0% and 200% of his base salary. The severance and change in control provisions of Mr. Delie's employment agreement are described in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables. 
Mr. Calabrese serves as our CFO and entered into the employment agreement, the amounts for which are detailed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, with FNBPA on February 21, 2013. The initial term of the

 agreement was for two years, and automatically extends for a one-year period on each anniversary of its commencement date such that, on the anniversary date, the contract has a 2-year term unless sooner terminated. Either party may terminate the automatic renewal of the agreement by providing the other with 60 days' advance written notice of non-renewal. Mr. Calabrese's contract runs through February 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Calabrese receives a base salary that may be increased from time to time as determined by the Committee. Additionally, Mr. Calabrese is eligible to participate in our annual incentive compensation and bonus plans at the discretion of the Committee with a target award level of 80% of base salary for 2018. Thus, he had the possibility of achieving a bonus between 0% and 160% of his base salary. The severance and change in control provisions of Mr. Calabrese's employment agreement are described in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables. 
Mr. Guerrieri serves as our Chief Credit Officer. He entered into an employment contract with FNBPA on January 25, 2002. Mr. Guerrieri's contract had an initial term of two years and automatically extends for a one-year period on the anniversary of its commencement date such that, on the anniversary date, the contract has a two-year term, unless either party terminates the contract sooner. Either party may terminate the automatic renewal of the agreement by providing the other 60 days' advance written notice of non-renewal. Mr. Guerrieri's contract runs through January 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Guerrieri receives a base salary, as reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table that may be increased from time to time as determined by the Committee. Mr. Guerrieri is also eligible to participate in our annual incentive compensation and bonus plans at the Committee's discretion. Mr. Guerrieri's target award level for annual incentive compensation was 60% of his base salary for 2018. Thus, he has the possibility of achieving a bonus between 0% and 120% of his base salary. The severance and change in control provisions of Mr. Guerrieri's employment agreement are described in the narrative accompanying the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables. In December 2008 and December 2012, we amended Mr. Guerrieri's contract in order to comply with and clarify certain points related to Code Section 409A. 
Mr. Moorehead is our Chief Wholesale Banking Officer and entered into his current employment agreement on September 10, 2015. Mr. Robinson serves as our Chief Consumer Banking Officer and entered into his current employment agreement on November 4, 2015. The agreements are for an initial term of two years and automatically renew such that, on the anniversary date, they have two years remaining. Under the terms of the contracts, Messrs. Moorehead and Robinson receive base salaries as reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table that may be increased from time to time as determined by the Committee. They are eligible to participate in our annual incentive compensation and bonus plans at the Committee's discretion. Their target award level for annual incentive compensation in 2018 was 60% of base salary with the possibility of achieving between 0% and 120% of base salary. The severance and change in control provisions of Messrs. Moorehead's and Robinson's employment agreements are described in the narratives accompanying the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables.

(1)  Award types are as follows: EIC is an annual incentive cash award,  RSU-TB is a long-term time-based restricted stock unit award, RSU-PB is a long-term performance-based restricted stock unit award and DIR is the annual director stock  award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts shown represent the threshold, target and maximum amounts to be earned by the NEO  under the annual incentive compensation program based upon our performance during 2018. The amounts actually earned for 2018 were above the target and are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan  Compensation column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  For awards granted April 2, 2018, the amounts shown represent the threshold, target and  maximum unit amounts that could be earned by the NEO under performance-based RSU awards based upon the Company's performance during a three-year performance period commencing January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, provided the  NEO remains continuously employed through the April 1, 2021 vesting date. As of December 31, 2018, we believe that it is probable that we will achieve the performance conditions between the threshold and target levels for the awards  granted April 2, 2018. We will not know the actual amount that vests until 2021. If we meet the performance conditions, and the NEO terminates service prior to the vesting date, the program may provide partial vesting depending on the reason  for termination as more particularly detailed in the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables. In 2018, the awards were in RSUs as more particularly described in the Long-Term Awards Section above.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The amount shown represents the number of time-based RSUs granted April 2, 2018, which will  vest if the NEO remains continuously employed until the April 1, 2021, vesting date. The amount for Mr. Delie also includes annual director stock awards as more particularly detailed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the  narrative under the Director Compensation discussion of this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  The amount shown represents the grant date fair value as determined under ASC Topic 718 of all  time-based restricted stock unit awards and all performance-based restricted stock unit awards, assuming payout at target levels, granted in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Participants who terminate service prior to year end are not eligible for annual incentive compensation under the program. In the event of death, disability, or retirement (i.e., age 55 with five years of service) during the year or before we make payment of the annual incentive award amount, the Committee may approve a discretionary pro-rata award. The program provides for payment in the case of a change in control as more particularly detailed in the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables. 
We issue time-based and performance-based awards in the form of RSUs that earn dividend equivalents that are subject to the same restrictions and vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs. The program allows for accelerated or pro-rated vesting of the RSUs in the case of death, disability, retirement, or change in control as more particularly detailed in the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables.

(2)  Options may be granted under the 2007 Plan with up to a  ten-year expiration date and with a strike price of no less than 100% of the closing sales price of our common stock on the NYSE on the business day preceding the award date. Options cannot be transferred or  assigned by a participant under the 2007 Plan, other than by will or pursuant to the laws of succession. We have not issued stock options for any year reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

(3)  Stock Awards are RSUs awarded under the 2007 Plan subject to a restriction period and/or  satisfaction of one or more performance-based criteria, as determined by the Committee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant terminates employment with us or our subsidiaries for a reason other than retirement, disability,  death or change in control, as detailed in the 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control tables, before the expiration of the applicable restriction period, the participant will forfeit any RSUs that are still subject to a  restriction. When RSUs vest, the participant recognizes ordinary income on the then market value of the shares, and we receive a tax deduction in that same amount.

Retirement Income Plan 
Until 2008, the RIP, a traditional defined benefit plan qualified under the Code and subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), was available to all salaried employees, except FNIA employees. In 2007, we closed the RIP to employees who commenced employment with us or our affiliates on or after January 1, 2008, and in 2010, we froze the plan and we have not made accruals for participants after December 31, 2010. The RIP provides for benefit payments in the form of a lifetime annuity with five years guaranteed and provides the participant with the ability to select from several choices for the form of the annuity. The election that the participant chooses may affect the amount of the annual benefit as reflected in the 2018

Pension Benefits table. Effective January 1, 2007, we amended the plan such that the benefit is calculated in two pieces. First, for the period worked by a participant prior to January 1, 2007 (Pre-2007 Benefit), the annual annuity benefit is payable without reduction to participants with five years of service who retire after age 62 and is calculated by multiplying each participant's final average base salary by 1.2% plus, if appropriate, 0.5% of the participant's final average base salary that is in excess of covered compensation (as defined in Section 401(1)(5)(E) of the Code), with the sum being multiplied by the participant's years of credited service, not to exceed 25 years including service through December 31, 2006. A participant's final average base salary is calculated using the highest 60 consecutive months of base salary, not including incentive compensation, within the last 120 months of the participant's service with us or our affiliates prior to January 1, 2007. The Pre-2007 Benefit was frozen as of December 31, 2006. Beginning in 2007, we calculated each participant's benefit by adding the Pre-2007 Benefit to the benefit determined under the post-2007 formula detailed below. For 2007 through 2010 (Post-2007 Benefit), we calculated each participant's annual retirement benefit by taking the participant's total pay earned from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2010, and multiplying it by 1%. The benefit earned after 2007 is payable without reduction to participants who retire on or after age 65. The RIP provides for cliff vesting after five years of employment. The RIP provides for an early commencement reduction factor that decreases as the participant's age approaches the normal retirement age of 62 for the Pre-2007 Benefit and 65 for the Post-2007 Benefit. The early reduction factor is multiplied by the participant's benefit as determined by the RIP to arrive at the reduced benefit. 
ERISA Excess Retirement Plan 
The Excess Plan is a non-qualified plan under ERISA and was available to all participants of the RIP until December 31, 2010, when we ceased all future accruals. The Excess Plan provides retirement benefits equal to the difference, if any, between the maximum benefit allowable under the Code and the amount that would be provided under the RIP formula if the Code did not impose limits on the amount of compensation included for purposes of calculating a qualified plan benefit. The Excess Plan provides the full amount of benefit that would have been paid under the formula of the RIP but for the Code limits, reduced by the amount of benefit that is actually provided by the RIP. The participant's rights to benefits under the Excess Plan cliff vest at 100% if the participant terminates service due to death, after a "change in control" (as defined in the Excess Plan), or upon retirement on or after reaching age 55 with five years of service. Benefits are payable either in an annuity or a lump sum depending upon the reason for termination, with payments commencing the first day of the month following six months after the participant separates from service. 
Basic Retirement Plan 
The BRP is a separate supplemental executive retirement benefit plan. Mr. Guerrieri is the only NEO to which the plan applies. Effective December 31, 2008, we amended the BRP such that there have not been any new participants in the plan or additional accruals for existing participants since the amendment. Officers participating in the BRP receive a benefit based on a target benefit percentage that is based on the officer's years of service at retirement. The target percentages are based upon the tier assigned to the participant by the Committee. The tier percentages are as follows: Tier 1, 3.00% for each of the first ten years of employment, plus 1.50% for each of the next ten years of employment, plus 0.75% for each of the next ten years of employment; Tier 2, 3.50% for each of the first ten years of employment, plus 2.00% for each of the next ten years of employment, plus 0.75% for each of the next ten years of employment. 
When a participant retires, the benefit under the BRP is a monthly benefit equal to the participant's aggregate target benefit percentage multiplied by the participant's highest average monthly cash compensation including bonuses during five consecutive calendar years within the last ten calendar years of employment before 2009. This monthly benefit is reduced by the monthly benefit the participant receives from the Social Security Administration, the RIP, the Excess Plan, and the annuity equivalent of the automatic contributions paid to participants under the 401(k) and Lost Match Plans. Before the plan was frozen, Mr. Guerrieri participated at the Tier 1 level. 
The participant's rights to benefits under the BRP vest at 100% if the participant terminates service due to death, disability, after a "change in control" (as defined in the BRP), or normal retirement (age 65). The BRP contains a provision for reducing the basic benefit if the participant retires prior to normal retirement but on or after early

[END TABLE]
The amounts reflected in the 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table were contributed to accounts for the NEOs under the ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan. The ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan provides for Company contributions, equal to the difference, if any, between the maximum benefit allowable under the Code and the amount that would be provided under the 401(k) Plan if the IRS did not impose contribution or pay limitations. Under the ERISA Excess Lost Match Plan, the amount credited to the participant's account accrues interest at the rate set by FNBPA as its highest interest rate on the first day of the year on the longest-term IRA account that it offers. The benefit is then paid as a single lump sum on the first of the month following six months after the participant terminates employment. 
In addition to the Lost Match Plan which is the deferred compensation plan detailed in the table above, we also maintain a deferred compensation plan known as the F.N.B. Corporation Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Plan). The Committee may select a group of management employees to participate in the plan. Currently, there are no participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan provides a participant the ability to defer into the plan a portion of his or her annual cash compensation, including 50% of base salary and 100% of any annual incentive compensation he or she would otherwise receive to help postpone and minimize taxes while accumulating capital on a pre-tax basis until termination of employment. A participant may elect to defer his or her compensation into a fixed interest rate option, with the interest rate determined by the Committee.

Our current NEOs are each a party to an employment agreement that provides for certain salary and benefits upon termination of employment under various scenarios. The agreements are all described more fully in the narrative and tables below. The tables below set forth the estimated current value of benefits that could be paid to each of our NEOs upon various termination events. The actual amounts paid upon any of these termination events will only be known at the time that the benefits become payable. The tables reflect the amounts that could be payable under the various arrangements if the event in question occurred as of December 31, 2018. The NEOs' employment agreements do not provide for any additional payments or benefits in the event of a voluntary termination of employment by the executive without good reason or an involuntary termination by us for cause.

(1)  In the event that we terminate Mr. Delie's employment without cause, or if he  terminates his employment for good reason, he is entitled to base salary continuation and a bonus payment for three years. In the event of a change in control resulting in his termination, he is entitled to three times his base salary plus a bonus  amount payable immediately as a lump sum. The bonus amount is calculated by taking the average of the annual amounts paid, whether paid in cash, company stock or other form, to Mr. Delie as a bonus for the last three completed fiscal years. In  the event of disability, he is entitled to the amount set forth in our Officers' Disability salary continuation program.

Mr. Delie's employment agreement does not provide for any additional benefits, other than the payment of accrued and unpaid obligations existing at the time of a voluntary termination of employment by Mr. Delie without good reason or by us for cause. Mr. Delie's agreement allows him to terminate the agreement for good reason and obtain the same termination benefits as if he was terminated by the Company for a reason other than cause. Under the terms of his agreement, good reason exists if Mr. Delie experiences any of the following: reduction in base salary unless the reduction is less than 10% and part of an overall reduction; a material diminution in compensation and benefits unless part of an overall reduction; a material diminution of his authority, duties and responsibilities; a change of material duties that are inconsistent with the position; a material diminution of the

Mr. Delie's contract does not provide a gross-up under Section 280G of the Code. 
For purposes of Mr. Delie's and all other NEO's employment agreements, "change in control" means any merger or consolidation with another corporation, and as a result of such merger or consolidation, our shareholders as of the day preceding such transaction will own less than 51% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving corporation, or in the event that there is (in a single transaction or series of related transactions) a sale or exchange of 80% or more of our common stock for securities of another entity in which our shareholders will own less than 51% of such entity's outstanding voting securities, or in the event of the sale of a substantial portion of our assets (including the capital stock we own in our subsidiaries) to an unrelated third party.

Mr. Guerrieri's employment agreement provides that Mr. Guerrieri may voluntarily terminate his employment after a change of control and receive a bonus payment payable in three installments equal to his Base Amount as defined in the Code. His contract does not provide for a gross-up under Section 280G of the Code. It was our intention when structuring the amendment to his agreement that any payments will comply with Code Section 409A. He is not entitled to any additional benefits other than accrued and unpaid obligations under a termination of employment voluntarily by Mr. Guerrieri or by the Company for cause. Mr. Guerrieri's agreement provides for a reduction of certain amounts in the above tables after the first 12 months of payments if Mr. Guerrieri obtains new employment. Mr. Guerrieri's employment agreement provides that upon a change in control, if the acquiring company terminates Mr. Guerrieri's employment, Mr. Guerrieri may obtain employment with a competitive enterprise, which new employment would otherwise be restricted by the employment agreement, provided Mr. Guerrieri releases the acquiring company from any payment obligations under the terms of the employment agreement. "Change in control" has the same definition as noted above for Mr. Delie.

Messrs. Calabrese, Guerrieri, Moorehead and Robinson's contracts do not provide for any additional benefits other than payment of accrued and unpaid obligations existing at the time of a voluntary termination of employment or by the Company for cause. Additionally, none of the NEOs are entitled to any type of gross-up under Section 280G of the Code. "Change in control" has the same definition as noted for Mr. Delie. 
Endnotes to All 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables 
(a) Upon termination for any reason, the NEOs are entitled to an immediate lump sum payment of accrued salary due to us paying employees one week in arrears. In the case of Change in Control — No Termination, the NEOs would still be employed and would, therefore, receive these accrued salary dollars consistent with our normal payroll practice of paying all employees one week in arrears. 
(b) The amounts reflected in the Executive Incentive Compensation row represent the payout earned under the annual incentive portion of the 2007 Plan. We make the payout in a lump sum approximately 60 days after the end of the year provided the participant is still employed by us on December 31st. For purposes of this table, in the

 event of death, disability or retirement, the Committee may approve a pro-rated award. The amount in the table is based on the assumption that the Committee would approve the award. Since the table assumes termination of employment as of December 31, 2018, pro-ration is not necessary. In the case of a change in control, the participant is entitled to receive a pro-rated award based on the date of termination not less than his targeted award. Therefore, the amount shown in the case of a change in control is based on the amount the NEO earned for 2018, not the NEO's targeted award. In the event we terminate any of the NEOs for cause, we do not owe the NEO any additional amount. 
(c) The amounts reflected represent the taxable income realized by the NEOs under each potential termination scenario based on the terms of the 2007 Plan. Under the 2007 Plan, both time-based and performance-based outstanding restricted stock awards, excluding the supplemental performance-based awards granted in December 2015, will become 100% vested at target levels in the event of the death of the participant or upon a change in control. Under the 2007 Plan, a change in control occurs when there is a merger or other consolidation which results in a 50% or greater change in the ownership of the common stock of the resulting company. In the event a current NEO becomes disabled or terminates employment due to normal retirement, all time-based restricted stock awards will become 100% vested, except that if the NEO retires in the same calendar year as we granted the award, the number of shares that shall vest will be pro-rated for the period worked. If an NEO terminates employment due to early retirement, all time-based awards of restricted stock will be pro-rated for the period worked. In the event an NEO terminates employment due to retirement or disability and we achieve the performance objectives, the performance-based shares, excluding the supplemental performance-based awards granted in December 2015, will vest on the vesting date in a pro-rated amount based on the period worked. The supplemental performance-based awards granted in December 2015 will become 100% vested at target levels in the event of death of the participant or upon termination without cause or the participant terminates for good reason within two years of a change in control. If an NEO terminates employment due to early retirement or disability and we achieve the performance objectives, the supplemental performance-based awards granted in December 2015 will vest on the vesting date in a pro-rata amount based on the period worked. 
As of December 31, 2018, the awards were tracking below threshold and thus, for purposes of these tables, we have assumed that the performance-based shares for the awards granted in 2016 and 2017 will not vest; the awards granted in 2018 will vest between the threshold and target levels; and, the awards granted in December 2015 will vest at the target levels, in the case of disability or retirement. The NEOs will forfeit all unvested awards if we terminate them without cause or if they terminate their employment for any other reason. 
(d) Upon termination for any reason, the NEOs are entitled to an immediate lump sum payment of earned but unused vacation days. In the case of a Change in Control — No Termination, the NEOs would still be employed and would therefore be entitled to carry over the earned but unused vacation days for use in 2019. 
(e) The amounts reflected represent the dollar amount of our matching and Company contributions into the 401(k) Plan as of December 31, 2018. Distributions from the 401(k) Plan will be paid at the NEO's election in a single lump sum, in a partial lump sum, or in monthly, quarterly or annual installments after termination of employment. For purposes of these tables, we have assumed that the NEOs would elect a single lump sum form of payment. In the case of a change in control that does not result in termination, the NEO would still be employed, thus no benefit is immediately payable. 
(f) The present values reflected above for the RIP were determined using the following assumptions: benefit payments paid as a monthly annuity commencing at age 65, except in the case of disability where payments would commence at age 65 once long-term disability benefits cease; an interest rate of 4.20%; no pre-retirement mortality; and for post-retirement mortality, the RP-2014 table projected with the MP-2018 improvement scale. The present values for Retirement, Change in Control — Termination, Good Reason or Involuntary Not for Cause Termination, and Disability were calculated based on a five-year certain and continuous annuity option. The present value for Death was calculated based on a 100% joint and survivor annuity option and assumes that the NEO and his spouse are the same age. In addition, the death benefit is assumed to commence immediately if the NEO is over age 55 or otherwise at age 55. In the case of a change in control that does not result in termination, no benefit is immediately payable. Note that we have shown the present value of the benefit available for consistency with the 2018 Pension Benefits table; however, the participant is only entitled to a lump sum distribution if the lump sum benefit under the RIP is less than $60,000.

(g) The present values reflected above for the Excess Plan and BRP were determined using the following assumptions: benefit payment paid as a monthly annuity commencing at age 65, except in the case of disability where payments would commence at age 65 once long-term disability benefits cease, and in the case of termination following a change in control where the payment would be in the form of an immediate lump sum; an interest rate of 4.05% for annuity payments and the IRS mandated segment rates for distributions in 2019 for the lump sum payment triggered due to Change in Control – Termination; no pre-retirement mortality; and for post-retirement mortality, the RP-2014 table projected with the MP-2018 improvement scale for annuity payments and the IRS mandated mortality for the lump sum payment due upon Change in Control — Termination. The present values for Retirement, Involuntary Not for Cause Termination, and Disability were calculated based on a five-year certain and continuous annuity option. The present value for Death was calculated based on a 100% joint and survivor annuity option and assumes that the NEO and his spouse are the same age. In addition, the death benefit is assumed to commence immediately if the NEO is over age 55 or, if the NEO is under age 55, the benefit is assumed to commence when the NEO reaches age 55. Note that we have shown the present value of the benefit available for consistency with the 2018 Pension Benefits table. The participant is not entitled to a lump sum payment unless there is a change in control. See the 2018 Pension Benefits table and accompanying narrative for more information about the pension benefits under this plan. 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information: 
For fiscal 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company was $46,848; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of Mr. Delie, our CEO, was $5,974,240.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio for 2018 of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is one hundred twenty-eight to one. 
We completed the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees and to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and CEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  As of November 1, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 4,479  individuals, including any full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal employees employed on that date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  To find the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, we used wages from our  payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for fiscal 2018. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of full-time and part-time permanent employees who were  employed on November 1, 2018, but did not work for us the entire year. No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  After identifying the median employee, we added together all of the elements of such  employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $46,848.  
[END TABLE]
We calculated the annual total compensation for the median employee in accordance with SEC rules, and using the same methodology used to calculate Mr. Delie's total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, and we also included F.N.B.'s health care plan premium contributions for both the employee and Mr. Delie. As a result, Mr. Delie's annual total compensation for pay ratio purposes is slightly higher than the amount reported for him in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Compensation Risk Management 
Our compensation philosophy supports and reflects F.N.B.'s risk appetite and risk management culture. Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with an experienced and independent executive compensation advisor, monitors and evaluates our compensation practices from a risk management perspective to ensure that such compensation and incentive practices do not encourage undue risk taking and are consistent with the Company's risk appetite. Our risk policies and procedures guide our management's decisions, including how we pay employees. By setting and communicating our risk appetite in advance, we seek to manage and control the risks that employees can take or effectively influence, consistent with their roles and responsibilities to serve our clients. 
All employees have performance objectives tied to business and individual performance, but each employee also has customer and compliance focus and risk management responsibilities. We evaluate employee performance against these objectives, in addition to considering risk outcomes from actions taken in prior years. We

[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation Committee Report     
   Compensation Committee Report     
   Compensation Committee Report     
[END TABLE]
 incorporate our comprehensive evaluation of employee risk management into our performance and incentive compensation decisions. In addition, all employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate and address identified risk-related issues or concerns. 
Our compensation program is designed to encourage management of risk within our risk appetite and discourages inappropriate risk-taking and conduct relative to our customers, by offering incentive compensation awards to our executives and employees designed, in part, to reward appropriate conduct relative to our customers. Likewise, the CEO, in consultation with senior management, performs a similar assessment for non-Section 16 employees relative to risk. Compensation decisions also rely on discretion to consider other factors, such as effective risk management, commitment to delivering a superior customer experience, compliance with controls and ethical duties, competition for top talent, market-based pay levels and the need to attract and engage our leaders. 
We conducted a risk assessment of our compensation programs for the purpose of determining inherent risks in the overall compensation program. Our Chief Risk Officer conducted the assessment with the assistance of the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Services. In conducting our review, we were also keenly aware of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Horizontal Sales review, its focus and results. Our Chief Risk Officer reviewed each compensation plan to identify any plan features that could lead an employee to take unnecessary and excessive risks that could pose a threat to our financial performance. He conducted a business unit review and a review of employee incentive plans and executive incentive plans, including company-wide benefit plans. He used a decision tree analysis to determine if the business unit compensation practices or the compensation plans fostered risk-taking and if so, conducted further analysis to determine if there were compensating controls or mitigants to limit the risk. Our review of the executive incentive plans considered design features including: pay profiles, performance metrics, performance goals, payout curves, equity incentives, stock ownership requirements, performance appraisal management, and our recoupment policy. Our Chief Risk Officer reviewed the executive incentive plans for design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. Specifically, he reviewed the compensation program for the following features, among others: pay profiles that provide for low salaries and high annual incentives; the use of performance metrics that do not benefit the Company over the long term; plan goals and payouts that did not consider the impact of decisions; steep payout curves where a very high threshold level of performance is required to achieve a threshold level of incentive payout; and an over emphasis on the use of long-term incentives paid in cash. 
Similarly, in the review of employee compensation plans, our Chief Risk Officer used a decision tree analysis that considered whether each plan was incentive based, and if so, whether the incentive was material relative to the participant's total compensation. If the incentive was material, he further reviewed the plan to determine if the plan appeared to foster risk-taking. If the plan fostered risk-taking, he evaluated the plan to determine whether there were compensating controls or mitigants to limit our risk. 
Finally, in the business unit compensation review, our Chief Risk Officer assessed whether the business unit generated a materially higher level of risk to us by considering various factors about the plans within each business unit. The factors he considered, among others, included: whether the business unit carried a significant portion of our risk profile; the business unit compensation structure and whether it was different from our other units; the business units' profitability; whether the employees in the business unit were awarded a short-term bonus while income and risk to us extended over a significantly longer period of time; and whether the compensation expenses comprise a significant percentage of the business unit revenues. 
We noted a number of compensation design features that we believe reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking. In our compensation programs applicable to our NEOs, the Committee has downward discretion over incentive program payouts; the program provides a balanced mix of cash and equity, and short-term and long-term incentives, includes multiple meaningful performance metrics, and we maintain a Recoupment Policy that provides for a clawback of cash and equity payments under certain circumstances. The employee plans include key risk indicators (KRIs) designed to measure quality control standards, compliance results and asset quality. When appropriate, the KRIs serve to modify the results generated solely by the key performance indicators and reduce compensation. Based upon the risk assessment presented to the Committee, we believe our employee compensation policies and procedures do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking and the level of risk resulting from our compensation policies and procedures is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

       Why You Should Approve Our  Executive Compensation Program      
[END TABLE]
Our compensation philosophy is designed to attract and retain executive talent and emphasizes pay for performance, primarily through the creation of shareholder value. Our compensation program includes base salary, short-term annual incentive compensation, long-term incentive compensation, retirement benefits and perquisites. 
We believe our compensation programs and policies are appropriate and effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals, and are strongly aligned with long-term shareholder interests and worthy of continued shareholder support. 
We believe the shareholders should consider the following information in determining whether to approve this proposal: 
The Compensation Program is Highly Aligned with Shareholder Value 
A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is directly linked to our performance and the creation of shareholder value because a significant portion of the direct and total compensation is in the form of incentive compensation, including annual incentive compensation and a significant long-term incentive award. Our long-term awards are in the form of RSUs and divided into a time vested portion and a performance portion. The performance portion, which is two-thirds of the overall award, only vests at the conclusion of three years if all performance measures are met. We believe these long-term awards motivate our executives to achieve long-term performance and reward them for increases in TSR. Furthermore, we do not award stock options, and only the Compensation Committee may approve equity grants. 
Summary of Key Compensation Practices 
We seek to align our compensation programs and practices with evolving governance best practices. The Compensation Committee strives to meet best practices with respect to executive compensation including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We target base compensation to be competitive with peers and structure our compensation plans to  increase compensation when our performance under various measures, including TSR, is better than peers.

Our Compensation Committee Stays Current on Best Practices 
We regularly update our Compensation Committee on compensation best practices and trends. In addition, the Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to provide advice on compensation trends and market information to assist the Compensation Committee in designing our compensation programs and making compensation decisions. 
The Compensation Committee directly engaged an independent compensation consultant that reported directly to the Compensation Committee and had no prior relationship with our CEO or any other NEO. Our directors are elected annually and meet without management present as a Compensation Committee and Board when necessary. The Compensation Committee maintains a charter and reviews its provisions annually. All committee charters and our Code of Conduct are posted on our website. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are asking shareholders to adopt an advisory resolution approving our executive compensation for NEOs, as reported in this Proxy Statement. 
We submitted an advisory resolution to approve 2017 executive compensation to our shareholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting. Shareholders owning more than 70% of the shares for which votes were cast regarding the advisory resolution on executive compensation approved the compensation of our NEOs as stated in our 2018 proxy statement. Additionally, at our 2017 Annual Meeting, our shareholders supported an annual advisory vote frequency. As a result, the Committee and the Board are again submitting for the vote of shareholders an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our NEOs, and will include this shareholder advisory vote annually until our shareholder vote at a future meeting recommends a change based upon how frequently we conduct a "say-on-pay" vote.

[END TABLE]
Following the last shareholder vote on executive compensation, the Committee considered the results of the advisory vote in determining compensation policies and decisions. The advisory vote reaffirms our pay-for-performance philosophy and the Committee will continue to use this philosophy and past practices in determining future compensation decisions. 
We are asking shareholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of F.N.B. Corporation (the Company) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers listed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in the proxy statement for this meeting, as such compensation is disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in this proxy statement under the Section entitled Executive Compensation and Other Proxy Disclosure, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and other narrative and other executive compensation disclosures set forth under that section." 
This advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote, gives shareholders another mechanism to convey their views about our compensation programs and policies. Although nonbinding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will carefully review and consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation programs. The Board has determined to provide shareholders with an annual advisory vote on executive compensation at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Accordingly, the next annual advisory vote on executive compensation will be provided at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2020.

[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Audit Committee selected  Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2018, to report on our internal controls and our consolidated statement of  financial position and related statements of income of us and our subsidiaries, and to perform such other appropriate accounting services as our Board may require. Ernst & Young LLP has advised us that they are independent accountants with  respect to us, within the meaning of standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Independence Standards Board and federal securities laws administered by the  SEC. In the event a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, we anticipate that we would make no change in our independent registered public accounting firm for the current year  because of the difficulty and expense of making any change so long after the beginning of the current year, but that vote would be considered when we consider the appointment of auditors for 2020.

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE 
To Our Shareholders: 
The Audit Committee oversees the Corporation's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, its independent registered public accounting firm who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, the matters we and Ernst & Young LLP must discuss pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including Ernst & Young LLP's judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Corporation's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence from management and the Corporation, including the matters in the required written disclosures. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of nonaudit services by Ernst & Young LLP is compatible with maintaining its independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Corporation's internal auditors and Ernst & Young LLP the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal auditors and Ernst & Young LLP, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        Audit and   Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy      
        Audit and   Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy      
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee must pre-approve the audit and nonaudit services the independent registered public accounting firm will perform in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee annually reviews and pre-approves the services that the independent registered public accounting firm may provide. The Audit Committee will revise the list of pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management, but may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom the Audit Committee delegates such authority must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee annually establishes pre-approval fee levels for all services the independent registered public accounting firm may provide. Any proposed services exceeding these levels require specific pre-approval. 
The annual audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee may grant pre-approval for other audit services, including statutory audits or financial audits for our subsidiaries or our affiliates and services associated with SEC registration statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC. 
Our Audit Committee must also pre-approve audit-related services. Audit-related services include, among others, due diligence services pertaining to potential business acquisitions/dispositions, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit" services, assistance with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting guidance from rulemaking authorities, financial audits of employee benefit plans, agreed upon or expanded audit procedures related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters and assistance with internal control reporting requirements. Tax services include tax compliance, tax planning and tax advisory services. 
Our Audit Committee may grant pre-approval to those permissible nonaudit services classified as "All Other" services that it believes are routine and recurring services and when such pre-approval would not impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firms.

Pursuant to Article I, Section 1.11 of our bylaws, a shareholder who wishes to nominate an individual for election to the Board of Directors directly at an Annual Meeting, or to propose any business to be considered at an Annual Meeting, must deliver advance notice of such nomination or business to our Corporate Secretary. The notice must be delivered in person, by first-class United States mail postage prepaid or by reputable overnight delivery service to the attention of our Corporate Secretary, at our principal executive offices at F.N.B. Corporation, One North Shore Center, 12 Federal Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212 during the period commencing at the close of business on November 30, 2019, and ending at the close of business on December 31, 2019.

The notice must be in writing and contain the information specified in our bylaws for a director nomination or other business. The notice must contain certain information about the proposal or nominee, as applicable, which is generally equivalent to the information that would be required to be disclosed under the proxy rules of the SEC if proxies were solicited for shareholder consideration of the matter at a meeting of shareholders, as well as certain information about the shareholder who is making the proposal or nomination. Nominees also will be required to submit a completed and signed questionnaire. The questionnaire will be provided by our Corporate Secretary upon request and is similar to the annual questionnaire completed by all of our directors regarding their background, experience and independence. 
Only shareholder proposals and nominations submitted in accordance with the Company bylaw provisions will be eligible for presentation at our 2020 Annual Meeting, and any other matter not submitted to our Board in accordance with such provisions will not be considered or acted upon at our 2020 Annual Meeting.

        "Householding" of Proxy Materials      
[END TABLE]
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report, proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. We, and some brokers who household proxy materials, may deliver a single copy of these proxy materials to multiple shareholders who share the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account, or us if you hold registered shares. You can notify us by sending a written request to: Shareholder Services, F.N.B. Corporation, One North Shore Center, 12 Federal Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15212, or by calling our Transfer Agent representative at 844-877-8750. Upon written or oral request to us or our Transfer Agent representative, a separate copy of our proxy materials will promptly be sent to you.
