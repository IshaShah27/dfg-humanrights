PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
These proxy materials are provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (sometimes referred to herein as "the Board") of Bloomin' Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Bloomin' Brands," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our"), for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at 8:00 a.m. (EDT) on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at the principal executive offices of the Company at Corporate Center One, 2202 North West Shore Boulevard, 4th Floor, Tampa, Florida 33607, and at any adjournments or postponements of the annual meeting. These proxy materials are first being distributed or otherwise sent to stockholders on or about March 15, 2019. 
PURPOSE OF MEETING 
The specific proposals to be considered and acted upon at the annual meeting are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  To elect three members to the Company's Board of Directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered certified public  accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  To obtain non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of the  Company's named executive officers  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  To obtain a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of holding future votes  regarding executive compensation  
[END TABLE]
Each proposal is described in more detail in this proxy statement. 
VOTING 
Voting Rights 
Only stockholders of record of Bloomin' Brands common stock on March 6, 2019, the record date, will be entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each holder of record will be entitled to one vote on each matter for each share of common stock held on the record date. On the record date, there were 91,632,531 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock must be present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting in order to have a quorum for the annual meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be treated as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner submits a proxy for the annual meeting without voting on a particular proposal, because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal. A bank, broker or other nominee may exercise its discretionary voting power with respect to the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered certified public accounting firm ("Independent Auditor") for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019 (Proposal 2), but does not have discretion to vote with respect to the election of directors (Proposal 1), the non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of the Bloomin' Brands named executive officers (Proposal 3), or the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of holding future votes regarding executive compensation (Proposal 4). 
A majority of votes cast at the annual meeting is required to elect directors in uncontested elections (Proposal 1). A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the nominee in order for such nominee to be elected as a director at the annual meeting. Any incumbent director who receives fewer "FOR" votes than "AGAINST" votes is required to offer his or her irrevocable resignation. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer of resignation and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director. The Board will then act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by filing a Form 8-K or other appropriate disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and the rationale for its decision within a period of 90 days following certification of the election results. 
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    1 
Proposals 2 and 3 require the approval of the holders of a majority of votes properly cast on the proposal. For Proposal 4, we will consider the frequency of holding future votes regarding executive compensation selected by the highest number of votes cast to be the recommendation of our stockholders. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the determination of whether a director nominee or any proposal has received a majority of the votes cast. 
If the persons present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting constitute the holders of less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date, the annual meeting may be adjourned to a subsequent date for the purpose of obtaining a quorum. 
Recommendations of the Board of Directors 
The Bloomin' Brands Board of Directors recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR each of the nominees to the Board of Directors (Proposal 1)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent  registered certified public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019 (Proposal 2)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the non-binding advisory approval of the  compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR a frequency of every ONE YEAR on the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of holding future votes regarding executive compensation (Proposal 4)  
[END TABLE]
Voting via the Internet, by Telephone or by Mail 
Registered Holders 
If you are a "registered holder" (meaning your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A.), then you may vote either in person at the annual meeting or by proxy. If you decide to vote by proxy, you may vote via the internet, by telephone or by mail and your shares will be voted at the annual meeting in the manner you direct. For those registered holders who receive a paper proxy card, instructions for voting via the internet or by telephone are set forth on the proxy card or such holders can complete, sign, date and return the mailed proxy card in the prepaid and addressed envelope that was enclosed with the proxy materials. For those stockholders who receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials provides information on how to access your proxy card, which contains instructions on how to vote via the internet or by telephone or receive a paper proxy card to vote by mail. Telephone and internet voting facilities for registered stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on April 29, 2019. 
If you return a signed proxy card on which no directions are specified, your shares will be voted FOR all director nominees, FOR Proposals 2 and 3, and every ONE YEAR on Proposal 4. 
Beneficial Holders 
If, like most stockholders, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" (meaning a broker, trustee, bank, or other nominee holds shares on your behalf), you may vote in person at the annual meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the nominee that holds your shares and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot at the annual meeting. Alternatively, you may provide voting instructions to the nominee that holds your shares by completing, signing and returning the voting instruction form that the nominee provides to you, or by using telephone or internet voting arrangements described on the voting instruction form, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other materials that the nominee provides to you. 
If you do not provide voting instructions to your nominee, the nominee will not vote your shares on the election of directors (Proposal 1), the non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3) or the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of holding future stockholder votes on executive compensation (Proposal 4). However, your nominee will be able to exercise its discretionary voting power with respect to the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our Independent Auditor for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019 (Proposal 2) and would be able to cause your shares to be counted as present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Electronic Delivery 
Stockholders who have elected to receive our 2019 proxy statement and 2018 annual report to stockholders electronically will be receiving an email on or about March 15, 2019, with information on how to access stockholder information and instructions for voting. 
2    Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement 
If you received your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or all of your annual meeting materials by mail, we encourage you to sign up to receive your stockholder communications electronically. Email delivery benefits the environment and reduces printing and mailing costs. With electronic delivery, you will be notified by email when the annual report on Form 10-K and proxy statement are available on the internet, and you can submit your stockholder votes online. Your electronic delivery enrollment will be effective until you cancel it. If you are a registered holder, visit www-us.computershare.com/Investor to create a login and to enroll. If you hold your Bloomin' Brands stock through a bank, broker or other nominee, please refer to the information provided by that entity for instructions on how to elect to view future proxy statements and annual reports over the internet and how to change your elections. 
Changing or Revoking Your Proxy 
You may revoke or change a previously delivered proxy at any time before the annual meeting by delivering another proxy with a later date, by voting again via the internet or by telephone, or by delivering written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices before the beginning of the annual meeting. You may also revoke your proxy by attending the annual meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the annual meeting will not, in and of itself, revoke a valid proxy that was previously delivered. If you hold shares in "street name," you must contact the nominee that holds the shares on your behalf to revoke any prior voting instructions. You also may revoke any prior voting instructions by voting in person at the annual meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described above. 
Admission to the Meeting 
You will need a valid government-issued picture identification and either an admission ticket or proof of ownership of our common stock as of March 6, 2019, to enter the annual meeting. If you are a registered owner, your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will be your admission ticket. If you received the proxy statement and annual report by mail, you will find an admission ticket attached to the proxy card sent to you. If you plan to attend the annual meeting, please bring the ticket with you for admission to the annual meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the annual meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker is an example of proof of ownership.

Board Committees and Meetings 
During our fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, the Board of Directors held eleven meetings. During fiscal 2018, each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of Board meetings (held during the period for which he or she has been a director) and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all Board committees on which he or she served (during the period that he or she served). Directors are strongly encouraged to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All of our directors who were then on the Board of Directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
We have three standing committees: the Audit Committee; the Compensation Committee; and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of these committees has a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. A copy of each charter can be found by clicking on "Corporate Governance" in the Investors section of our website, www.bloominbrands.com. 
Under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), our Board of Directors must consist of a majority of directors who meet NASDAQ's independence requirements ("Independent Directors") and the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees must be composed entirely of Independent Directors. See "Independent Directors" for additional information regarding these independence requirements and our satisfaction of these requirements.

Independent Directors 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, an "independent" director is one who meets the qualification requirements for being independent under applicable laws and the corporate governance listing standards of NASDAQ. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the relationships of each director and director nominee and makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to make an affirmative determination that such director or director nominee is independent. Upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that: (a) Messrs. Craigie, Fitzjohn, Mahoney and Mohan and Mses. Beck, Grossman and Levy are independent under the criteria established by NASDAQ for director independence; (b) Messrs. Craigie and Mahoney and Ms. Levy are independent under the criteria 
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    7 
 established by NASDAQ for audit committee membership; and (c) Messrs. Fitzjohn and Mohan and Mses. Beck and Grossman are independent under the criteria established by NASDAQ for compensation committee membership. 
Arrangements or Understandings Regarding Service as a Director 
Ms. Beck was appointed by the Board of Directors to serve as a Class I director on February 28, 2018 pursuant to an agreement that we entered into on February 28, 2018 with JANA Partners LLC ("JANA Partners"). The agreement contained customary standstill provisions and voting commitments and our commitment to appoint Ms. Beck for a term ending at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The agreement, which expired on October 26, 2018, is more fully described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018. 
None of our other directors or nominees have any agreements or arrangements with any other person or entity in connection with the director's or nominee's candidacy or service on our Board. 
Nominees for the Board of Directors 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that nominees for director shall be selected on the basis of their business experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, such as relevant industry knowledge; specific experience with technology, accounting, finance, leadership, strategic planning, and international markets; independence; judgment; integrity; the ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the Board of Directors; diversity of occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board of Directors; the absence of potential conflicts with our interests; and such other criteria as may be established by the Board of Directors from time to time. These criteria are considered in the context of an assessment of the operation and goals of the Board as a whole. In addition, the Board considers, in light of our business, each director nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that are identified in the biographical information contained under "Proposal 1—Election of Directors." Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no incumbent director may stand for re-election to the Board of Directors after reaching the age of 75. However, the Board may waive this requirement on a per-term basis as to any incumbent director if the Board determines such waiver to be in the best interests of the Company. 
In recommending candidates for election to the Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers nominees recommended by directors, officers, employees and others, using the same criteria to evaluate all candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews each candidate's qualifications, including whether a candidate possesses any of the specific qualities and skills desirable in certain members of the Board of Directors. Evaluations of candidates generally involve a review of background materials, internal discussions and interviews with selected candidates as appropriate. Upon selection of a qualified candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends the candidate for consideration by the full Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may engage consultants or third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. In the case of Ms. Beck, she was appointed to the Board of Directors pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners LLC, as described above. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider nominees for election to the Board of Directors submitted by stockholders using substantially the same criteria it applies to recommendations by directors, officers, employees and others. To recommend a prospective nominee for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's consideration, submit the candidate's name and qualifications to our Corporate Secretary in writing to the following address: Bloomin' Brands, Inc., Attention: Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, 2202 North West Shore Boulevard, Suite 500, Tampa, Florida 33607. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors has established a policy that provides it with the flexibility and discretion to select its Chairman at any time, based on what it believes to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The policy further provides that the same person may serve as both Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO. Ms. Smith currently serves as both Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, and Mr. Craigie serves as our Lead Independent Director. 
As Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ms. Smith's executive responsibilities provide insight that assists our Board of Directors in addressing both internal and external issues affecting the Company. 
Mr. Craigie, as Lead Independent Director, is responsible for, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• calling and presiding at meetings of the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serving as the principal liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
8    Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• leading the independent director's evaluation of the CEO's effectiveness as Chairman and CEO   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• when appropriate, consulting and communicating with stockholders  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assisting the Chairman with the review and preparation of agendas for Board meetings  
[END TABLE]
In addition, various other corporate governance measures also contribute to a high degree of independent oversight of the Company's management, including holding regular executive sessions, all directors other than Ms. Smith and all of the Board committee members being independent under the NASDAQ standards, and the Board and each committee conducting annual self-assessments to ensure they are functioning effectively. The Board of Directors believes that this leadership structure is appropriate at this time and provides the most effective leadership in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry. Combining the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO fosters accountability, effective decision-making and alignment between interests of the Board of Directors and management, while the role of the Lead Independent Director fosters independent oversight of the Board. The Board of Directors periodically reviews this leadership structure to ensure that it continues to meet our needs in light of all relevant facts and circumstances at that time. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
It is management's responsibility to manage risk and bring material risks to the attention of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors administers its risk oversight role by reviewing strategic, financial and execution risks and exposures associated with the annual plan and multi-year plans; cyber security, major litigation and other matters that may present material risk to our operations, plans, prospects or reputation; acquisitions and divestitures; and senior management succession planning. This oversight role is performed both by the Board of Directors and through the committees, who provide regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee reviews risks associated with financial and accounting matters, including financial reporting, accounting, disclosure, internal controls over financial reporting, ethics and compliance programs, organizational culture, compliance with law and protecting against and responding to breaches of our data security. The Compensation Committee reviews risks related to executive compensation and the design of compensation programs, plans and arrangements. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, and other persons performing similar functions. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found by clicking on "Corporate Governance" in the Investors section of our website, www.bloominbrands.com. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors through our Corporate Secretary by writing to the following address: Bloomin' Brands, Inc., Attention: Board of Directors, 2202 North West Shore Boulevard, Suite 500, Tampa, Florida 33607 (we encourage you to send a copy via email to CorporateSecretary@bloominbrands.com). Our Corporate Secretary will forward all appropriate correspondence to the Board of Directors. 
Director Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the competitiveness of our Board of Directors Compensation Plan applicable to non-employee directors. Directors who are also our employees do not receive additional compensation for serving on the Board. Shares for equity awards pursuant to the Board of Directors Compensation Plan are issued from our stockholder approved equity compensation plan in effect at the time of award (currently the Bloomin' Brands, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan) and pursuant to which we are authorized to grant shares of our common stock and share-based awards to directors. 
Based on the results of a competitive analysis, supported by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant Frederic W. Cook & Co. ("FW Cook"), the Compensation Committee recommended and our Board of Directors determined to maintain the board members' current annual cash retainer of $90,000 and approved an increase in the annual grant from $100,000 to $120,000 for grants to be issued on or after July 1, 2018. Further, the Compensation Committee recommended and our Board of Directors approved an increase effective July 1, 2018 to the additional retainer amount payable to the Lead Independent Director (from $25,000 to $50,000 annually); and a $5,000 increase to the additional annual retainer payable to each of chairpersons of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (collectively, the "Committee Chairs"). As no adjustments to the annual cash retainer, annual grant or additional annual retainers to Committee Chairs had been made since the Board of Directors Compensation Plan took effect on August 7, 2013, these adjustments were made to maintain competitiveness of our directors' compensation levels relative to our peer group. 
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    9 
Our current Board of Directors Compensation Plan, which has been in effect since April 7, 2013 and last amended April 23, 2018, includes the following compensation components for services rendered by our non-employee directors effective July 1, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual retainer of $90,000

[END TABLE]
If a non-employee director is elected at any time other than at our annual meeting of stockholders, such director will receive an initial grant of restricted stock units having a fair market value, based on the closing price of the underlying common stock on the grant date, of $120,000 on the date of the first Board of Directors meeting that such director attends, prorated for the number of months that such director will serve on the Board from and including the month of the director's first Board meeting as a director through the month of our next annual meeting of stockholders, rounded to the nearest $100 and vesting as to one-third of the shares immediately prior to each of our annual meetings of stockholders thereafter. 
The Board of Directors adopted a Stock Ownership Guidelines Policy for directors, executive officers and members of our executive leadership team, which consists of the Company's executive vice presidents, senior vice presidents and concept presidents (the "Executive Leadership Team"). With respect to directors, Ms. Smith and all non-employee directors are required to accumulate shares of our common stock through direct purchases or retention of equity incentives (the "Stock Ownership Requirement"), equal to five times base salary for Ms. Smith, and five times the annual retainer for all non-employee directors. The Stock Ownership Requirement must be met by the latter of December 17, 2019 or the fifth anniversary of the director's or executive officer's initial election or appointment, as applicable. 
The following table summarizes the amounts earned and paid to non-employee directors during fiscal year 2018:

PROPOSAL NO. 3 ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
General 
We provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act ("Exchange Act"). This vote is referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 17 and the compensation tables beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement describe our executive compensation program and the compensation of our named executive officers for 2018. The Board of Directors is asking stockholders to cast an advisory vote indicating their approval of that compensation by voting FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Bloomin' Brands APPROVE, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to its named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion." 
As described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we have a total compensation approach focused on performance-based incentive compensation that seeks to drive a pay for performance culture and: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain qualified executives in today's highly competitive market  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• motivate and reward executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to the success of the business   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a competitive compensation package that aligns management and stockholder interests by tying a significant  portion of an executive's cash compensation and long-term compensation to the achievement of annual performance goals  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure internal equity among the executive officers by recognizing the contributions each executive makes to the success  of Bloomin' Brands  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews our executive compensation program to establish a strong connection between compensation and the aspects of our performance that our executive officers can impact and that are likely to have an effect on stockholder value. We believe that in 2018, our Company's overall financial performance, same-store comparable sales growth, continued improvement to the guest experience, and further investment in emerging off-premises opportunity demonstrate the effective relationship between Company goals and our compensation program. 
The vote on this "say-on-pay" proposal is advisory, which means that the vote will not be binding on Bloomin' Brands, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will review and consider the results of the vote on this proposal in connection with its regular evaluations of our executive compensation program. As the Board of Directors has currently determined to hold this vote each year, absent any changes made as a result of the stockholders' recommendation under Proposal 4, the next "say-on-pay" vote will be held at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.

PROPOSAL NO. 4 ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF HOLDING FUTURE VOTES REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
General 
Our stockholders are also entitled to cast an advisory vote to indicate the frequency with which we should hold future advisory votes regarding executive compensation, also referred to as "say-on-pay" votes. Stockholders may vote whether to hold "say-on-pay" votes every one, two or three years. Stockholders also have the option to abstain from voting on this matter. We will consider the interval selected by the highest number of votes cast to be the recommendation of our stockholders. 
The Board of Directors believes at this time that "say-on-pay" votes should be held every year. Holding an annual advisory vote provides us with more direct and immediate insight into our stockholders' views on our executive compensation program. 
Although this advisory vote is not binding on the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors values stockholder views as to what is an appropriate frequency for advisory "say-on-pay" votes. We will carefully review the voting results on this proposal. Notwithstanding the Board of Director's recommendation and the outcome of the stockholder vote, the Board of Directors may in the future decide to vary its practice on the frequency of advisory "say-on-pay" votes. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote for every ONE YEAR for the frequency of holding future "say-on-pay" votes regarding executive compensation.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND RELATED INFORMATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Market Context and Our Response 
2018 Macroeconomic and Industry Conditions and the Effect on Our Business 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Last tranche of 2015 PSU award (based on 1-year Adjusted EPS) paid above target  and 2016 PSU award (based on 3-year average annual Adjusted EPS growth) paid below target  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the casual dining industry landscape continued to evolve, driven by changing consumer preferences. Despite low unemployment and high consumer confidence, the improving macroeconomic backdrop did not translate into casual dining traffic growth. The oversupply of restaurants, the relative affordability and quality of prepared meals from supermarkets, and an increase in home delivery services have changed industry dynamics and led to an increased emphasis on discounts and promotions to improve value. 
A heightened value focus combined with rising inflationary pressures, particularly where the improved labor market has led to an increase in industry labor costs, has muted the ability to pass additional costs to consumers through higher prices. This combination has added pressure to industry operating margins. 
In response to the evolving market conditions, we continued our strategic plan to revitalize our competitive position to drive profitability, strengthen our balance sheet and increase returns to stockholders. Actions taken in 2018 included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinvested into Managing Partners and service staff to improve our retention and maintain competitiveness given the  tightening labor market  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prioritized the emerging off-premises opportunity and grew to approximately 450  locations with delivery activation across the United States  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhanced guest experience through product upgrades, menu innovation, expansion of the Dine Rewards loyalty program and  the ongoing investment in exterior and interior remodels to contemporize our restaurants  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Optimized domestic go-to market strategy through actions such as relocating  Outback Steakhouse restaurants to better locations  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strengthened our balance sheet through various capital allocation initiatives, such as entering into new interest rate  swaps to fix a larger balance of our capital structure amid rising interest rates and the completion of sale-leaseback transactions for certain restaurant properties  
[END TABLE]
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    17 
Through successful execution on these strategic imperatives in 2018, the Company outperformed on key financial objectives. In 2018, the Company improved cash flows, returning cash to our stockholders through $33.3 million in dividends and reduced debt by repurchasing $114.0 million of our common stock. Further, we increased revenue and performed above plan on EPS, positioning the Company to further grow and improve profitability. 
Impact on Our Pay Decisions 
For fiscal 2018, we administered our compensation program to motivate execution and implementation of our financial and operations objectives. Highlights of our compensation program for 2018 included the following stockholder-aligned pay decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Held CEO target compensation flat (for the fourth consecutive year) in response to market conditions   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Held target compensation for other NEOs flat  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Set rigorous goals in line with our growth objectives above last year's performance and achieved 114% of target on  the short-term incentive plan  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintained our long-term incentive program focus on retention during execution of our strategic priorities   
[END TABLE]
Pay and Performance Alignment – Chief Executive Officer Realizable Pay 
In line with our pay for performance philosophy, the realizable value of our NEOs' pay responds to market conditions and Company performance. The following table illustrates this by comparing our CEO's 2018 target and realizable incentive pay, which reflects our performance and total stockholder return in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Note: Target pay includes target bonus and the grant date value of options, RSUs and performance share units  ("PSUs") awarded for fiscal 2018. Realizable pay for such awards includes bonus payout and the in-the-money value of stock options, the total market value of  the RSUs awarded, and the total market value of the shares underlying PSUs at target (as they are not yet earned), in each case based on the December 30, 2018 stock price.  
[END TABLE]

The following chart illustrates the relationship between our CEO's target and realizable compensation for the prior three years and the Company's three-year total shareholder return. Over the period, our CEO's realizable compensation has tracked the stockholder experience while target compensation has remained flat.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Note: Target pay includes base salary, target bonus and the grant date value of options, RSUs, and PSUs for the  applicable period. Realizable pay includes base salary, bonus payout, in-the-money value of stock options, the total market value of RSUs granted during the fiscal  period, and the total market value of PSUs earned (or at target if not yet earned) during the period in each case based on the December 30, 2018 stock price.  
[END TABLE]
Responding to Stockholders – Our Investor Outreach Program 
In line with our commitment to align our pay programs with the experience of our stockholders, the Compensation Committee considers stockholder feedback when designing and setting our executive compensation program. At our 2018 annual meeting, our Say-on-Pay proposal received a vote of 92.7% support in favor of our executive compensation. While we believe this strong support from our stockholders indicates satisfaction with our program, we believe it is important for us to communicate with our stockholders regarding areas of interest or concern. 
In 2018, we conducted wide-ranging governance reviews and investor outreach to ensure that management and the Board understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders to enable the Company to address them effectively. 
After considering feedback received from investors, the Company adopted the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Amended Bylaws") to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections to a majority voting standard from a plurality voting standard (this change is more fully described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2018). In addition, as a result of investor feedback, the Compensation Committee approved at their December 2018 meeting the introduction of Adjusted Operating Income Margin% as an additional metric applicable to the 2019 short-term incentive plan ("2019 STIP") with a 20% weighting, thereby reducing the weighting of Adjusted EPS and Total Revenue Growth to 40% each, respectively. We believe this change will drive continued focus by our executives on margin expansion goals for 2019.

Compensation Program Philosophy 
The Company's primary objectives for its executive compensation programs are to attract and retain executives, provide a competitive compensation package, and motivate and reward a talented, entrepreneurial and creative team of executives. 
Our methods of achieving these objectives are summarized below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Attract and retain talented executives       Provide a competitive total compensation package by taking into account base salary,  performance incentives and benefits 
   Motivate and reward executives       Provide a significant portion of each executives target total compensation in  the form of equity compensation 
       Balance incentives between equity-based and cash-based compensation to support a  high-performing culture 
   Provide a competitive compensation package       Benchmark our compensation against competitors and peer group 
       Target competitive positioning to align with industry 
   Ensure internal equity among executives       Adjust compensation based on review of job responsibilities and individual performance  in addition to market data 
   Align management and stockholder interests       Provide compensation based on short-term and long-term performance  objectives 
   Pay for Performance       Provide the majority of executive pay in  variable, at-risk incentive awardsapproximately 86% and 67% of targeted compensation in 2018 for our CEO and other NEOs, respectively, to ensure that realized pay is tied to attainment of  significant short-term and long-term operating goals

20    Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement 
Peer Group and Competitive Market Information. The Compensation Committee utilizes a peer group of certain consumer discretionary companies to evaluate executive officer compensation levels and to benchmark our executive compensation design and governance features. The Compensation Committee reviews the peer group on an annual basis to ensure the peer group includes companies with certain attributes. These attributes include that the companies are of comparable size (based on revenue, market capitalization and other relevant metrics), maintain strong consumer brands, have multiple consumer brands in their portfolios, have an entrepreneurial culture, are globally positioned and compete with us for executive talent. 
For 2018, the peer group data compiled by the independent compensation consultant, FW Cook was used to establish market consensus information (the "Competitive Market") against which the Compensation Committee assessed our compensation elements. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews other benchmarking data as presented by FW Cook and the Company's human resources management, such as equity vesting practices, the prevalence of performance metrics among peer companies, types of equity vehicles used by peer companies and equity burn rates. 
The peer group used for 2018 compensation benchmarking consisted of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Brinker International, Inc.    Foot Locker, Inc.    The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated 
 Buffalo Wild Wings     Hyatt Hotels Corporation    The Wendy's Company 
 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.     Jack in the Box Inc.    Williams-Sonoma Inc. 
 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.     MGM Resorts International    Wyndham Worldwide Corporation 
 Darden Restaurants, Inc.     Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings    YUM! Brands, Inc. 
 DineEquity, Inc.     Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.     
 Domino's Pizza     Texas Roadhouse, Inc.      
[END TABLE]
In July 2018, the Compensation Committee revised the peer group to be used for 2019 and subsequent compensation decisions to remove Buffalo Wild Wings due to the sale of the company to a private equity firm. No other changes were made to the peer group for 2019. 
Competitive Positioning. Our executive compensation program is designed to provide the Compensation Committee flexibility to set compensation in the Competitive Market ranges shown below for each element of compensation. Compensation for each individual may be below or above the targeted competitive positioning based on several factors including performance of the business, the individual's skill set relative to industry peers, overall experience and time in the position, critical nature of the individual's role, difficulty of replacement, expected future contributions, readiness for promotion to a higher level and role relative to that of other executive officers and other business factors. 
In assessing the target range for compensation relative to the market, the Compensation Committee considered the need to attract and retain key executive talent by providing minimum, competitive levels of base salary while taking into account that base pay serves as the basis for short-term and long-term incentive opportunities. For incentive-based compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the competitive market for talent in the restaurant industry, and the responsibility of our executive officers for determining the overall strategy and direction for the Company. The Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to target the median for fixed compensation and between the median and 75th percentile for incentive compensation to provide meaningful leverage in our incentive plans and motivate executives to achieve high performance in both the short-term and long-term. 
While our target ranges provide our Compensation Committee with the flexibility to set pay in these ranges, the Compensation Committee does not actively pursue setting pay at the higher end of these ranges.

Compensation Setting Process 
Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program and, in some cases, together with the Board of Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approves the type and amount of compensation paid to our CEO and other executive officers  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approves agreements with our executive officers  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provides oversight to our equity compensation plan  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meets periodically and monitors our compensation arrangements and objectives  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers the Competitive Market data provided by FW Cook and the Company's human resources management, as well as recommendations from management, to evaluate the appropriateness and competitive positioning of the CEO and the other NEOs' total compensation and each compensation element. The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation of the CEO and recommends her compensation to the full Board of Directors for approval, which also reviews the CEO's performance. 
Our executive officers possess employment agreements or offers of employment that establish, among other things, the executive's base salary and target bonus, measured as a percentage of base salary, as well as benefits upon a termination of employment and/or a change in control of the Company. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for approving equity awards to our executive officers in order to qualify these awards as exempt awards under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee has engaged FW Cook to serve as its independent compensation consultant since 2013. FW Cook's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing compensation market data, advising on trends and developments in executive compensation, periodically reviewing the design of the executive compensation program, providing independent analysis of CEO compensation and providing advice to the Compensation Committee and its Chair, as requested. The Compensation Committee has directly engaged, and has the sole authority to hire and terminate FW Cook. FW Cook attends Compensation Committee meetings and, on occasion, obtains information and input from management to ensure that its recommendations are consistent with Bloomin' Brands' strategy and culture. The Company does not engage FW Cook for any other unrelated consulting or services. 
Role of Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions. The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the CEO with respect to salary adjustments, annual cash incentive bonus targets and awards and equity incentive awards for our other executive officers. In addition, the CEO provides input to the Compensation Committee on the design of incentive compensation and other employee benefit plans to ensure alignment with the Company's strategy. 
Our CEO reviewed fiscal 2018 performance objectives with the Compensation Committee, including financial objectives and non-financial objectives for strategic business and human capital priorities. The Compensation Committee meets in executive session with and without its compensation consultant to review and discuss the performance and compensation of the CEO. The CEO does not participate in determinations or recommendations regarding her own compensation.

Compensation Elements 
Mix of Total Compensation. Our compensation program consists of three primary elements and other secondary benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                Compensation Element   Description 
                Compensation Element   Description 
 Primary Elements         Base salary    Fixed cash compensation designed to provide  appropriate, Competitive Market-based predictable compensation 
  Performance-based cash incentives    Variable cash compensation based on  pre-established performance goals measured against Compensation Committee-approved annual targets and individual performance 
  Long-term equity incentive awards    Variable compensation distributed in the form of PSUs  (30%), RSUs (40%) and stock options (30%) 
   PSUs cliff vest after 3 years based on achievement of  performance goals 
   RSUs vest ratably over 4 years 
   Stock options vest ratably over 4 years 
  Other benefits and perquisites    Medical, dental and vision insurance coverage, as  well as life insurance and disability protection 
   Deferred compensation plan to allow efficient  personal tax planning 
[END TABLE]
In allocating compensation among the various compensation elements, we provide equitable and competitive levels of fixed compensation (base salary and benefits) while emphasizing performance-based compensation that is dependent on our overall performance along with individual performance. Long-term equity incentives comprise the largest share of total compensation and provide an important connection to stockholder interests. We do not target a specific percentage for each element of compensation relative to total compensation. Our mix of compensation results from targeting a percentage that will allow us to be competitive. 
The charts below show the target compensation mix for the CEO and the average target compensation mix for the other NEOs. 
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    23 
Base Salaries. Base salaries reflect demonstrated experience, skills and competencies, as well as Competitive Market value. Base salary levels of our executive officers may be increased by the Compensation Committee as part of the annual performance review process, upon an executive officer's promotion, change in job responsibilities or to address internal or external equity, as recommended by management. 
As a result of Competitive Market data analysis, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain current base salaries based on the Company's relative position to the market. 
Base salaries of the NEOs are listed in the table below:

[END TABLE]
Performance-Based Short-Term Incentive Plan. Cash incentives are awarded to our executive officers under our performance-based short-term incentive plan ("STIP"). The STIP is designed so that a significant portion of each NEO's compensation is dependent on the financial performance of the Company. These awards are payable based on the achievement of annual financial objectives measured against our internal operating plan and individual achievement of performance goals established at the beginning of the year related to the Company (the "2018 Corporate STIP"). Annual STIP targets, measured as a percentage of base salary, are established in each executive officer's employment agreement or offer of employment and may be increased by the Compensation Committee from time to time. Payouts can range from 0% to 200% of the established percentage of salary, with a payout of 100% if target performance is achieved and 200% if maximum performance is achieved. No payouts are made under the STIP unless a minimum objective of profitability is achieved. 
• 2018 STIP Measures and Targets 
For 2018, the bonuses for all NEOs were based on the 2018 Corporate STIP to better align our corporate and concept leaders with a singular, common focus on the achievement of Company-wide performance goals. The financial objectives for the 2018 Corporate STIP consisted of two measures: Adjusted EPS (weighted 50% of the STIP) and Total Revenue Growth (weighted 50% of the STIP). 
The 2018 Corporate STIP payout was based on Company performance compared to the pre-established financial goals of (1) adjusted earnings per share (adjusted net income as further adjusted for certain items such as foreign exchange translation, divided by the total diluted weighted-average shares outstanding (weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, including RSUs, PSUs and stock options) ("Adjusted EPS")) (Adjusted EPS calculation for STIP purposes is similar to the non-GAAP Adjusted EPS that we use in our presentations with stockholders, adjusted to exclude the impact of sale leaseback transactions, certain restaurant closings, certain gains and losses on disposed assets and certain other gains and losses, and the impact of other infrequent occurrences that are not reflective of our business operations (collectively, the "Certain Items")) and (2) total revenue growth (measured as the percentage increase in total revenue over the prior fiscal year ("Total Revenue Growth"). The purpose of the adjustments is to ensure that the measurement of performance reflects factors that management can directly control and that payout levels are not artificially inflated or impaired by factors unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 for additional information. 
In addition, the STIP payout amount is subject to individual performance ratings. These criteria encourage critical leadership behaviors and performance, such as the development of a high-performing and inclusive team, a strong commitment to high ethical standards and the achievement of strategic goals and objectives for the year. The 2018 Corporate STIP target payout amounts for each NEO, as a percentage of his or her base salary were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Ms. Smith     150%    — 
 Mr. Deno     85%    — 
 Mr. Scarlett (1)     85%    —

The 2018 Corporate STIP target amounts were payable with respect to the achievement of each financial objective as follows (expressed as a percentage of growth over the prior year). The minimum and maximum payout amounts ranged from 0% to 200% of target, based on a non-linear sliding scale: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Ms. Smith        75%        75% 
 Mr. Deno      42.5%     42.5% 
 Mr. Scarlett      42.5%     42.5% 
 Mr. Herlihy      42.5%     42.5% 
 Mr. Kadow      42.5%     42.5% 
[END TABLE]
The Adjusted EPS and Total Revenue Growth performance levels were established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the year based on the Company's business plan, as well as industry and general economic conditions and trends, among other considerations. For 2018, we broadened the slope of the payout line to address uncertainty in goal setting and to be consistent with others in our industry. Our goals were rigorously set based on our business plan and at or above last year's results. The performance levels were expected to present a challenge, especially with the persisting economic conditions; however, achievement of these goals was not viewed as requiring or encouraging excessive risk-taking by our executives. 
• 2018 Performance 
For the 2018 Corporate STIP, the Company reported Adjusted EPS of $1.50 (comparable calendar year) and Total Revenue Growth of 0.7%. After adjusting for the Certain Items, Adjusted EPS achieved under the STIP was $1.42, resulting in a weighted achievement payout percentage of 114% of target for all NEOs. 
In addition to the financial performance measures listed above, each executive officer was assigned an individual performance rating for the year, as recommended by the CEO. Individual performance and subsequent compensation decisions are based on the achievement of strategic goals and objectives for which the individual is responsible, such as the development of a high-performing and inclusive team, a strong commitment to high ethical standards, the individual's skill set relative to peers, the critical nature of the individual's role, the difficulty of replacement, their expected future contributions and their role relative to that of other executive officers. 
In determining incentive award payouts for 2018, the Compensation Committee and Board considered the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance against plan  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Measured and timely progress on the off-premises opportunity   
[END TABLE]
Ms. Smith and Mr. Herlihy received 100% individual performance rating, Mr. Deno received 110% individual performance rating, Mr. Scarlett received 130% individual performance rating and Mr. Kadow received 125% individual performance rating. Their efforts led to the achievement of the Company's annual operating plan, maximizing short-term business results while supporting the achievement of long-term goals. 
• 2018 STIP Payouts 
The financial performance achieved under the 2018 Corporate STIP combined with the respective individual performance resulted in the following performance-based cash incentives:

Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    25 
Performance-based cash incentives earned by the NEOs are reflected in the "—Summary Compensation Table" under the heading "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." Threshold, target and maximum payments for the NEOs under the 2018 STIP are reflected in "—Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2018." 
Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") Equity Awards. LTI awards are designed to align a significant portion of total compensation with long-term stockholder value creation. These equity awards are designed to reward longer-term performance, facilitate equity ownership, deter outside recruitment of our key personnel and further align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. Equity awards have generally been limited to our executive officers and other key employees who are in a position to contribute substantially to our growth and success. 
• Administering LTI Awards 
In April 2016, the Company's stockholders adopted a new Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2016 Plan") to replace our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan"). The purpose of the 2016 Plan is to promote the interests of our Company and its stockholders by (1) providing a means for our Company to attract and retain talented individuals; (2) encouraging the profitability and growth of our Company through annual and long-term incentives that are consistent with our goals and link a significant portion of compensation to the value of our common stock; and (3) providing incentives that will align the interests of our employees, consultants and directors with those of our stockholders. This plan was in effect for awards beginning in May 2016. 
The Company also has an Equity Award Policy that prohibits granting equity awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information, and we do not time the release of material nonpublic information based on equity award grant dates. Because the Company believes equity awards are an important part of our compensation program, we grant equity awards on an annual basis to key employees (other than newly hired employees), including our executive officers. Annual equity awards must be approved by the Compensation Committee (or the Board) and granted following the second business day after the announcement of earnings for the fiscal year. This policy exists so the Company can issue our annual equity award grants during the time when potential material information regarding our financial performance is most likely to be available to the market. The Compensation Committee approves new-hire, promotion and retention equity awards for NEOs as well as other executive officers, and has delegated the authority to the Equity Award Committee to approve all other "off-cycle" new-hire, promotion and retention equity awards. No "off-cycle" equity awards were granted to NEOs in 2018. 
• 2018 LTI Awards 
In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, LTI grants to our executive officers under the 2016 Equity Plan consisting of 40% RSUs, 30% stock options and 30% PSUs. 
RSUs provide our key executives with meaningful retentive value. RSUs continue to represent a significant portion of our LTI mix, reflecting our commitment to retention as our Company and industry evolve in response to changing consumer demands. Our Compensation Committee is committed to the Company's long-term success and view continuity of management as key to successful execution of our strategic imperatives. The 2018 RSUs vest 25% per year over four years. 
Stock options provide our executives the opportunity to share in the increase in stock value over time, further aligning the incentives of our officers with the experience of our stockholders. The 2018 stock options vest 25% per year over four years, have an exercise price equal to 100% of the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and are exercisable over a ten-year term, contingent upon continued employment. 
PSUs align our executives with stockholders by encouraging leaders to have a longer-term perspective with respect to driving sustainable performance, rather than taking risks for short-term pay-off. The 2018 PSUs have a cumulative three-year performance period, with cliff vesting at the end of the period, contingent upon meeting performance objectives and continued employment. The number of units earned varies to the extent the performance targets are achieved over the period, ranging from 50% for threshold achievement to 200% for maximum achievement. The PSUs are distributed upon the Compensation Committee certifying that the performance metrics have been attained and making a recommendation of payment that is approved by the Board. 
26    Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement 
Management and the Compensation Committee review the performance target each year as part of the LTI design to ensure the goals drive the right behaviors and business decisions. For 2018, Adjusted EPS growth was chosen as the performance measure for the PSUs in order to continue to encourage executives to successfully balance profit maximization and the efficient use of capital. We believe that Adjusted EPS is an appropriate short-term and long-term performance goal since there is a direct correlation between the increase in adjusted earnings per share and stockholder value, as well as the value of the equity to be received by the executive officer. The following table shows the percentage of PSUs that may be earned under the 2018 PSU award based on the average annual percentage growth of the Company's Adjusted EPS over the 2018-2020 performance period: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    THRESHOLD (50% of shares are earned)    TARGET (100% of shares are earned)    MAXIMUM (200% of shares are earned) 
    THRESHOLD (50% of shares are earned)    TARGET (100% of shares are earned)    MAXIMUM (200% of shares are earned) 
 2018-2020  Average Annual Adjusted EPS Growth (1)     5%    8%    13% 
(1)  The baseline Adjusted EPS for 2017 used to measure such growth is $1.20, as restated within our 2018 Annual Report on  Form 10-K for the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, including related tax impacts resulting from the adoption of the new tax law and further adjusted on a comparable calendar year basis since  2017 was a 53-week fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
• Previously Awarded PSUs 
Prior to 2016, the PSU design utilized four one-year performance periods. Beginning in 2016, the PSUs began utilizing a cumulative three-year performance period. Therefore in 2018, the our NEOs earned two PSU payouts: (1) the 2018 tranche of the 2015 PSU award and (2) the 2016 PSU award based on the cumulative 2016-2018 period. 
2015 PSU Award. The Company's 2018 Adjusted EPS, as defined under the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2015 award agreements, was the performance metric for the fourth tranche of the 2015 PSU award. Adjusted EPS calculation for LTI purposes is similar to the non-GAAP Adjusted EPS that we use in our presentations with stockholders, adjusted to exclude the impact of Certain Items. The following table shows the percentage of PSUs earned under the fourth tranche of the 2015 PSU award and the applicable performance measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Adjusted  EPS (2015 grant) (1)    $    1.22    $    1.35    $    1.56    $    1.50    175% 
(1)  Adjusted EPS as defined for this grant excludes the impact of Certain Items that are not reflective of our business  operations.  
[END TABLE]
2016 PSU Award. LTI grants made in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period represented the first annual PSU grants to utilize a cumulative three-year performance period. Average annual Adjusted EPS growth relative to 2015 Adjusted EPS, as defined under the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2016 award agreements was the performance metric for the 2016 PSU award. Adjusted EPS calculation for LTI purposes is similar to the non-GAAP Adjusted EPS that we use in our presentations with stockholders, adjusted to exclude the impact of Certain Items. The following table shows the percentage of PSUs earned under the 2016 PSU award and the applicable performance measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2016-2018  Average Annual Adjusted EPS Growth     (2016 grant) (1)    6%    10%    15%    6.4%    55%

(1)  Due to the 3-year cliff vesting, none of the 2017 or 2018 PSU awards will vest  until fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
Other Policies and Practices Related to Executive Compensation 
Compensation Recovery ("Clawback"). We have a Compensation Recovery Policy pursuant to which the CEO, certain officers who report directly to the CEO and key employees designated by the Board will be required to return incentive compensation paid to them if the financial results upon which the awards were based are restated and republished under applicable securities laws, excluding any restatement required due to changes in accounting rules or standards or changes in applicable law (a "Material Financial Restatement"). 
At the Board's discretion, we can recover all or a portion of any cash or equity-based compensation to the extent that it is paid, earned or vests less than three years prior to the date we publicly disclose the need for the applicable Material Financial Restatement. 
We believe our Compensation Recovery Policy is sufficiently broad to reduce the potential risk that the CEO, certain officers or key employees would intentionally misstate results in order to benefit under an incentive program and provides the opportunity for recoupment of compensation that should not have been rewarded. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. To further strengthen the link between executive and stockholder interests, we have a Stock Ownership Guidelines Policy for directors, executive officers and other executive leadership team members who are eligible to receive long-term incentive awards. The target level of ownership of our common stock is established as a multiple of base salary or annual retainer, as applicable.

Insider Trading Policy—Prohibitions on Hedging and Pledging. Under our Insider Trading Policy, our directors and executive officers are prohibited from engaging in short sales or investing in other kinds of hedging transactions or financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our securities. In addition, our directors and executive officers are prohibited from holding our securities in a margin account and from pledging our securities as collateral for a loan. 
28    Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement 
Other Benefits and Perquisites. The NEOs are each entitled to receive certain perquisites and benefits under the terms of their employment agreements and offers of employment. We believe these benefits are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program and better enable us to attract and retain qualified employees for key positions. Such benefits include life insurance, medical insurance and annual physical examinations. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other benefits provided to the NEOs. 
We offer a deferred compensation plan for our highly compensated employees who are not eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan. The deferred compensation plan allows highly compensated employees to contribute from 5% to 90% of their base salary and from 5% to 100% of their cash bonus on a pre-tax basis to an investment account consisting of various investment fund options. The plan permits us to make a discretionary contribution to the plan on behalf of an eligible employee periodically; however, we have not made any discretionary contributions to date. In the event of the employee's termination of employment, the employee is entitled to receive the full balance in the account in a single lump sum or in equal annual installments over a specified period of two to 15 years. If the employee becomes disabled or dies before any deferred amounts are paid out under the plan, we will pay to the employee (or the employee's beneficiary if applicable) the full balance in the account in a single lump sum. If the employee's employment terminates due to death or disability after he or she begins receiving payments, the remaining installment payments will be paid in installment payments as such payments come due. 
The amounts attributable to perquisites and other benefits provided to the NEOs are reflected in the "—Summary Compensation Table" under the heading "All Other Compensation." 
Change in Control and Termination Benefits. Each employment agreement or offer of employment and our equity award plans and agreements establish, among other things, the executive's benefits upon a termination of employment and/or a change in control. For a summary of these arrangements, see "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
In addition, the Board of Directors adopted an Executive Change in Control Plan (the "Change in Control Plan"), which entitles executive officers and other key employees to certain severance payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment upon or within the 24 months following certain change in control events. The payments and benefits will be reduced by the amount of any severance or similar payments or benefits under an employment agreement or other arrangement with us and are subject to the employee's compliance with non-competition and other restrictive covenants and the other terms and conditions of the Change in Control Plan. These benefits are described in more detail under "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
The Compensation Committee considers these severance and change in control benefits to be an important part of the executive compensation program and consistent with Competitive Market practice. The Compensation Committee believes that providing appropriate severance benefits helps to attract and retain highly-qualified executives by mitigating the risks associated with leaving a previous employer and accepting a new position with the Company, and by providing income continuity following an unexpected termination. Furthermore, these severance benefits provide the executive officers with a reasonable range of income protection in the event of a qualifying employment termination and, following a change in control, support our executive retention goals and encourage their independence and objectivity in considering potential change-in-control transactions. These arrangements also allow the Company to protect its interests through corresponding confidentiality, non-competition and other restrictive covenants in the event of an executive's termination. 
Tax and Accounting Implications 
In making decisions about executive compensation, the Compensation Committee took into account certain tax and accounting considerations, including Sections 162(m), 409A and 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, we account for stock-based payments in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic No. 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation." Accordingly, our Compensation Committee has, in its judgment, authorized compensation payments that did not comply with the exemptions in Section 162(m) when it believed that such payments were appropriate to attract and retain executive talent or is otherwise in our best interests. In addition, because there are uncertainties as to the application of regulations under Section 162(m), as with most tax matters, it is possible that our deductions may be challenged or disallowed. Going forward, our Compensation Committee will consider the recent changes to Section 162(m) and any appropriate changes to our executive compensation program. 
Our Compensation Committee considers the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. As accounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Fitzjohn and Mohan and Mses. Grossman and Beck, all of whom are Independent Directors. 
Compensation-Related Risk 
As part of its oversight and administration of our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considered the impact of our compensation policies and programs for our executive officers, to determine whether they present a significant risk to the Company or encourage excessive risk taking by our executive officers. Based on an assessment performed by its independent compensation consultant FW Cook, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

(2)  In recognition of their significant responsibilities in 2017 to continue the efforts of the transformational strategy  that began in 2016 relating to reinvestments in our product and labor model, cost cutting measures, revisions to our menus and improvements in our supply chain, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board in March 2017 a payment of special  cash incentives to all NEOs other than the CEO. Payments to the NEOs were made in the following amounts: Mr. Deno $200,000 and Mr. Scarlett $150,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amounts reported for stock awards represent the aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs. The aggregate  grant date value of the RSUs was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 718, based on the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. PSU awards pay out at a range of 0% to a maximum of 200% of their targets based on the  following performance measures: 50% for threshold, 100% for target and 200% for maximum. For 2018, the PSU amounts reported represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the 2018 award based on the probable attainment of the performance measures  as of the grant date (assumed to be 100% for target) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 718. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 2018 PSUs assuming achievement of the maximum performance level of 200% would be: Ms. Smith,  $2,700,031; Mr. Deno, $624,010; Mr. Scarlett, $537,618; Mr. Herlihy, $324,037 and Mr. Kadow, $303,015. We recorded compensation expense in 2018 for the aggregate grant date fair value of the fourth tranche of the 2015 PSUs based  on probable attainment of the performance goals as of the grant date as follows: Ms. Smith, $726,807; Mr. Deno $183,729, Mr. Scarlett, $48,464; Mr. Herlihy, $87,242; and Mr. Kadow, $80,774. For 2016 and 2017, the PSU amounts  reported include the aggregate grant date fair value of the PSUs assuming achievement at Target performance level of 100%. See "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" under the heading "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" for  a description of the RSU and PSU terms. See also Note 7, "Stock-based and Deferred Compensation Plans," in our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for  additional information regarding these awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The amounts for option awards represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock option awards computed in  accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 718. The stock option awards were valued at fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. See Note 7, "Stock-based and Deferred Compensation Plans," in our consolidated  financial statements in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2018 for the assumptions made to value the stock option awards. Stock Option awards are subject to vesting  requirements. See "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" under the heading "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" for a description of the stock option terms.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  Non-equity incentive plan compensation represents amounts earned under the  performance-based cash incentive plans, or STIPs, established for such years. The amounts earned were based on the achievement of specified, pre-determined levels of Company-wide Adjusted Net Income, concept  Adjusted EBIT and/or Total Revenue Growth over the prior year relative to a percentage of the NEOs' bonus potential. See "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" under the heading "Performance-Based Short-Term Incentive  Plan" for a description of the STIPs for 2018.

(1)  Amounts represent potential performance-based cash incentive awards under the 2018 Corporate STIP for all NEOs. The  minimum award level is 1% of target bonus, the target award level is 100% of target bonus, and the maximum award level is 200% of target bonus. Actual payouts are derived using a non-linear scale between such  points. Threshold is represented with minimum payout of stipulated financial plan, but zero payout is possible if threshold performance measures are not met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Amounts represent potential shares to be issued upon settlement of the aggregate number of PSUs granted in 2018, which  vest as to 100% of the shares on the third anniversary of the grant date, contingent upon such executive's continued employment by us, and the number of shares earned ranges from 0% to 200% based upon the achievement of performance targets set  at the beginning of the performance period as follows: 50% for threshold, 100% for target and 200% for maximum. Any portion of the award that is unvested upon termination is generally forfeited. See "-Compensation Discussion &  Analysis" under the heading "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" for a description of the PSU terms. The executive generally forfeits any portion of the award that is unvested upon the termination date or for which the threshold  performance is not achieved. See "-Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" for additional information regarding accelerated vesting on certain terminations of employment.

Bloomin' Brands, Inc. — 2019 Proxy Statement    35 
 termination is a termination by us for any reason other than cause, or by the employee for good reason, in each case as defined in the Change in Control Plan. 
Under the Change in Control Plan, in the event of a qualifying termination within the 24 months following a change in control, the named executive officers are each entitled to receive the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A severance payment, payable in a lump sum 60 days after the termination, equal to (a) with respect to  Ms. Smith, two times the sum of her base salary and her target annual cash bonus and (b) with respect to the other named executive officers, one and one-half times the sum of base salary and target  annual cash bonus

The severance payments and other benefits described above will be reduced by the amount of any similar payments and benefits under any employment agreement or other arrangement with us and are subject to the employee's compliance with non-competition and other restrictive covenants and the other terms and conditions of the Change in Control Plan. 
Rights and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control: Ms. Smith 
In September 2012, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Ms. Smith for a five-year term that automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party elects not to renew by giving written notice to the other party not less than 60 days prior to the start of any renewal term. The employment agreement is also subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances described below. 
Ms. Smith's employment may be terminated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Upon her death or disability (as defined in the agreement)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By us for Cause. "Cause" is defined to include: (i) willful failure to perform, or gross negligence in the  performance of, her duties and responsibilities to us or our affiliates (other than any such failure from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), subject to notice and cure periods; (ii) indictment or conviction (or plea of guilty or  nolo contendere) of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude; (iii) engaging in illegal misconduct or gross misconduct that is intentionally harmful to us or our affiliates; or (iv) any material and knowing violation by her of any  covenant or restriction contained in her employment agreement or any other agreement entered into with us or our affiliates  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By us other than for Cause  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Ms. Smith for Good Reason. "Good Reason" is defined to include: (i) a material diminution in the  nature or scope of her duties, authority or responsibilities, including, without limitation, loss of membership on our Board of Directors (with certain listed exceptions); (ii) a reduction of her annual base salary or annual target cash bonus;  (iii) requiring her to be based at a location in excess of 50 miles from the location of our principal executive offices in Tampa, Florida; or (iv) a material breach by us of our obligations under her employment agreement   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Ms. Smith other than for Good Reason  
[END TABLE]
Ms. Smith will be entitled to receive severance benefits if her employment is terminated by us other than for Cause or if she terminates employment for Good Reason. If her employment is terminated under these circumstances, she will be entitled to receive severance equal to two times the sum of her base salary at the rate in effect on the date of termination plus her target annual cash bonus for the year of termination, payable in 24 equal monthly installments from the effective date of such termination. 
In the event Ms. Smith's employment is terminated due to her death or disability, she will receive any base salary amount and any annual bonus amount for the preceding fiscal year earned but not paid as of the date of her employment termination, any accrued and payable travel or business expenses and benefits under the employee benefit plus a pro rata portion of her target bonus for the year of termination. 
A change in control of the Company does not trigger any severance payments to her under the employment agreement. However, in the event of a qualifying termination within the 24 months following a change in control, Ms. Smith would be entitled to receive the benefits described above under "—Change in Control Plan." 
Rights and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control: Mr. Deno 
On May 7, 2012, Mr. Deno entered into an employment agreement with us for a five-year term that is automatically renewed for successive renewal terms of one year unless either party elects not to renew by giving written notice to the other party not less than 60 days prior to the start of any renewal term.

However, in the event of a qualifying termination within the 24 months following a change in control, Mr. Kadow would be entitled to receive the benefits described above under "—Change in Control Plan." 
Equity Awards 
As a general matter, unless otherwise provided in an individual's award agreement or other agreement, and depending on the reason for termination, upon a termination of employment all unvested equity awards will terminate and vested stock options must be exercised within certain limited time periods after the date of termination. If the individual's employment is terminated for cause (as defined in the award or other applicable agreement), all stock options, whether vested or unvested, will terminate immediately. If the individual's termination is due to death or disability, all RSUs that are not vested will become immediately vested in full upon such termination and a pro rata portion (based on the portion of the applicable performance period that passed prior to termination of the individual's employment) of the target number of PSUs will immediately vest and become payable in shares of common stock upon such termination. 
Awards under the 2012 Equity Plan, if unvested, will forfeit upon retirement. Under the 2016 Equity Plan, if the NEO retires on or after age sixty (60) with five (5) years of service with the Company or an affiliate ("Retirement") prior to the vesting or forfeiture of the RSUs, then the number of RSUs that vest shall be determined as of the date of the Retirement on a pro rata basis, determined based on the number of full months of employment completed from the date of grant to the date of the Retirement divided by the number of full months of the original vesting period. If the NEO retires prior to the vesting or forfeiture of the option to purchase shares of our common stock, the NEO may exercise the option at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of Retirement (but in no event later than ten (10) years after the date of grant). 
The Compensation Committee may provide for accelerated vesting of an award upon, or as a result of events following, a change of control. This may be done in the award agreement or in connection with the change of control. In the event of a change of control, the Compensation Committee may also cause an award to be canceled in exchange for a cash payment to the participant or cause an award to be assumed by a successor corporation. 
Our forms of award agreements under the 2012 and 2016 Equity Plans provide as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock and restricted stock units awards to our directors become fully vested upon a change of control   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock awards for our employees and consultants provide that upon a change of control (a) restricted stock  that remains outstanding or is exchanged or converted into securities of the acquiring or successor entity will continue to vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the award agreement and (b) if the restricted stock will be canceled in  exchange for cash consideration, (x) in the case of awards held by our executive officers at the time of such change of control, the restricted stock will instead be converted into a right to receive such cash consideration upon satisfaction of  the vesting and other terms and conditions of the award agreement in effect immediately prior to the change of control and (y) in the case of other award recipients, the award will fully vest and be exchanged for the cash consideration at the  time of the change of control  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSU awards provide that if the award recipient's employment or other service status with us terminates, the award  will terminate as to any units that are unvested at the time of such termination, unless (a) such termination is due to death or disability, in which case a pro rata portion of the award shall vest based on the portion of the performance period  for which service was provided, or (b) the termination occurs before the vesting date but after the end of the performance period and is other than for cause (as defined in the agreement), in which case the applicable number of units will vest  for that performance period as if such termination had not occurred  
[END TABLE]

In addition, as described above under "—Change in Control Plan," in the event of a qualifying termination within the 24 months following a change in control, each of our named executive officers will be entitled to accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards. 
Stock Options: Ms. Smith 
Pursuant to the terms of Ms. Smith's option agreement dated November 16, 2009, the vested stock options will remain outstanding for a period ranging from 90 days to three years in the case of a termination of Ms. Smith's employment, depending on the type of option and the nature of the termination, except that all options will be forfeited on a termination for Cause. 
Restrictive Covenants 
Ms. Smith, Mr. Deno, and Mr. Kadow are subject to certain restrictive covenants under their employment agreements. These include covenants covering (i) noncompetition and (ii) nondisclosure, nonsolicitation and nonpiracy. Based on the terms of their agreements, Ms. Smith, Mr. Deno, and Mr. Kadow have agreed to the restrictive covenants in (i) and (ii) during employment and for, with respect to Ms. Smith and Mr. Deno, 24 months and, with respect to Mr. Kadow, 12 months following a termination of employment for any reason. Ms. Smith's, Mr. Deno's and Mr. Kadow's continued compliance with these restrictive covenants are conditions to our obligation to pay the severance amounts due under their employment agreement or offer of employment. 
Messrs. Scarlett and Herlihy are subject to certain restrictive covenants as per their offers of employment. These include covenants covering (i) noncompetition and (ii) nondisclosure, nonsolicitation and nonpiracy. Each has agreed to the restrictive covenants in (i) and (ii) during employment and for 12 months following a voluntary separation or separation for Cause, or in the event of separation for any reason other than voluntary resignation, for a period equal to the period used for calculating the amount of severance paid upon termination, if any.

Executive Benefits and Payments Upon Separation 
The table below reflects the amount of compensation payable under the arrangements described above to the individuals serving as NEOs following a termination of employment (i) by us without Cause or by the executive for good reason without a change in control, (ii) by us without Cause or by the executive for good reason, following a change in control assuming that such termination constitutes a qualifying termination under the Change in Control Plan, (iii) by the executive voluntarily, (iv) as a result of disability or (v) as a result of death, in each case, assuming that such termination of employment occurred on December 30, 2018. 
No payments or benefits are due to the NEOs following a termination of employment for Cause. The table assumes that the change in control transaction resulted in per share consideration of $17.60, which was the closing price per share of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on December 28, 2018, the last market day of our fiscal year. The actual amounts to be paid upon a termination of employment or a change in control can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from us, or upon the occurrence of a change in control (if any).

(1)  Amounts in the table do not include amounts for accrued but unpaid base salary, annual bonus or other expenses.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Amounts represent intrinsic value of unvested  in-the-money stock options since the fair market value of a share of our common stock, as of December 28, 2018, was greater than the exercise price of certain stock  options held by the named executive officers. Certain stock option grants were out-of-the-money as of the fiscal year end and are  included above with a value of $0. Amounts exclude intrinsic value of vested in-the-money stock options. If termination is due to Death or Disability, then all RSUs that  are not vested shall become immediately vested in full upon such termination and a pro rata portion (based on the portion of the Performance Period that passed prior to termination of Participant's Continuous Service) of the Target Number of  Performance Awards will immediately vest and become payable in shares upon such termination. The dollar amounts are determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to the accelerated RSUs and Performance Awards by $17.60, the closing price of  the Company's common stock on December 28, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
We are providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of our CEO, as required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Regulation 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For fiscal year 2018, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, other than Ms. Smith, was $10,453.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Smith's annual total compensation was $7,217,956, as reported in the Total column of the —Summary  Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. Smith to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 691 to 1. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1)  We selected October 1, 2018 as the date on which to determine our median employee. As of that date, we had 87,451  employees, with 77,064 employees based in the United States and 10,387 employees located outside of the United States. The pay ratio disclosure rules provide an exemption for companies to exclude non-U.S.  employees from the median employee calculation if non-U.S. employees in a particular jurisdiction account for five percent (5%) or less of the Company's total number of employees. We applied this de  minimis exemption when identifying the median employee by excluding 35 employees in China and 692 employees in Hong Kong. After considering the de minimis exemption, 77,064 employees in the United States and 9,660 employees located outside of the  United States were considered for identifying the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2)  For purposes of identifying the median employee from our employee population base, we considered total cash  compensation, as compiled from our payroll records. We selected total cash compensation as it represents the principal form of compensation delivered to all our employees and this information is readily available in each country. In addition, we  measured compensation for purposes of determining the median employee using the year-to-date period ended October 1, 2018. Compensation paid in foreign currencies  was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on October 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3)  Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a part-time employee. In determining the annual  total compensation of the median employee, such employee's compensation was calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, as required pursuant to the SEC executive compensation  disclosure rules.  
[END TABLE]
Our CEO pay ratio information is a reasonable good faith estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC pay ratio rules and methods for disclosure. The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations, geographic footprints and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. With regard to restaurant, hospitality and retail companies, comparability may further be impacted by additional factors including the mix of company-owned to franchised units.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and a Related Party Transactions Policy, which supplements the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to our directors, officers, and employees, and the Related Party Policy applies to our executive officers. These policies require disclosure of the material terms of any applicable related person transaction, including the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction, and all the material facts as to the related person's direct or indirect interest in, or relationship to, the related person transaction. The policies require that all related person transactions must be reported to the Chief Legal Officer and are subject to the approval or ratification by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may approve or ratify the transaction if it determines that the transaction is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The transactions below were reviewed under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and also reviewed under the Related Party Transactions Policy subsequent to July 22, 2015, which is the date of its adoption. 
Related Party Transactions 
In fiscal 2018, MVP LRS, LLC ("MVP"), an entity in which Robert D. Basham (one of our founders who is known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock) is a partner, paid us $349,255 in lease payments. These leases were originally for two restaurants in the Lee Roy Selmon's concept, which were purchased from us in 2008. In 2014, MVP converted one of the restaurants into a Glory Days Grill® restaurant, and we entered into a new lease with MVP for the restaurant. On August 28, 2017, we entered into a Lease Termination and Surrender Agreement with MVP for the other restaurant property. The payment to MVP for the buyout of that lease was $850,000, payable within five business days after termination of the lease. The lease was terminated effective June 30, 2018. 
We also guarantee lease payments by MVP under a third party lease for another Lee Roy Selmon's restaurant location that MVP purchased from us in 2008 and converted to a Glory Days Grill® restaurant in 2018. The lease guaranty expires in 2037. The estimated base rent payments made by MVP under the lease totaled $87,294 for 2018. As guarantor, we are also contingently liable for percentage rent, real estate taxes, insurance expense and certain other operating expense payments under the lease.

STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers) to implement a delivery procedure called "householding." Under this procedure, multiple stockholders who reside at the same address may receive a single copy of our annual report and proxy materials, including the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, unless the affected stockholder has provided contrary instructions. This procedure reduces printing costs and postage fees.

A single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and, if applicable, a single set of annual report and other proxy materials will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. Stockholders may revoke their consent at any time by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, either by calling toll-free (866) 540-7095, or by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York, 11717. 
Upon written or oral request, Bloomin' Brands will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and, if applicable, a separate set of our annual report and proxy materials to any beneficial owner at a shared address to which a single copy of any of those documents was delivered.
