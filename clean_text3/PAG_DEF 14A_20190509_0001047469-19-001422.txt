     Questions about the Meeting   
[END TABLE]
   Q.    What am I voting on?  
   Q.    Who can vote?  
A.    Our stockholders as of the close of business on the record date, March 12, 2019, can vote at the annual meeting. Each share of our common stock gets one vote. Votes may not be cumulated. As of March 12, 2019, there were 84,138,506 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
   Q.    Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
A.    As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials primarily over the Internet rather than mailing paper copies of those materials to each stockholder. On or about March 27, 2019, we will mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders, which provides website and other information for the purpose of accessing our proxy materials. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed or electronic set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. We encourage you to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the cost and environmental impact of the printing and mailing of materials for the annual meeting. 
   Q.    How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?  
A.    The Notice provides you with instructions regarding how to view our proxy materials for the annual meeting on the Internet and instruct us to send proxy materials to you by email. Choosing to receive proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of the printing and mailing of materials for our annual meeting on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email message next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting website. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect unless and until you rescind it. 
   Q.    What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?  
A.    Stockholder of Record.    If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Limited, you are the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and we sent the Notice directly to you. If you request copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a proxy card. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct  Table of Contents that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you request copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form. 
   Q.    How do I vote my shares?  
A.    If you are a stockholder of record or a participant in the Company's stock fund within our Company 401(k) plan, you may vote in any of the following ways: 
By Internet. You may vote online by accessing www.envisionreports.com/pag and following the on-screen instructions. You will need the Control Number included on the Notice or on your proxy card, as applicable. You may vote online 24 hours a day. If you vote online, you do not need to return a proxy card. 
By Telephone. In the U.S., you may vote by calling toll free 1-800-652-VOTE (1-800-652-8683) and following the instructions.

   Q.    How many votes must be present to hold the meeting?  
A.    Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you attend the meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone. In order for us to conduct our meeting, a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 12, 2019 must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting (42,069,254 shares).

A.    If you "withhold" with respect to one or more director nominees, your vote will have no effect on the election of such nominee(s), as the thirteen nominees receiving the highest number of "For" votes will be elected as directors.

A broker non-vote with respect to a proposal occurs when shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee in street name, and the bank broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner as to how to vote such shares. Brokers have the authority under New York Stock Exchange rules to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain "routine" matters resulting in a broker non-vote. Under these rules, only the proposal to ratify our independent auditing firm is a "routine matter" being voted on by our stockholders this year. Broker non-votes will only be counted for Proposal 2. 
   Q.    How many votes are needed to approve the proposals?  
A.    Regarding the election of directors (Proposal 1), our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast and the thirteen nominees receiving the highest number of "For" votes will be elected as directors.

      Board Committees         
Our Board of Directors has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Management Development Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Executive Committee. Charters for the Audit, Compensation and Management Development, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees are available on our website, www.penskeautomotive.com, under the heading "Governance" within the "Investor Relations" section. The principal responsibilities of each committee are described below. Collectively, our directors attended 97% of our board and committee meetings in 2018, and each director attended at least 87% of their meetings. All of our directors are encouraged to attend the annual meeting of stockholders and all directors serving at that time attended the annual meeting in 2018. 
 Committee Member Qualifications.    Each of the members of our Audit, Compensation and Management Development, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are independent under New York Stock Exchange guidelines and our guidelines for director independence. The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are "independent" and "financially literate" under New York Stock Exchange rules and applicable law, and each of the four are "audit committee financial experts," as that term is defined in Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the: Table of Contents
The Compensation and Management Development Committee assists the Board of Directors in discharging its responsibility relating to:
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee:    
 Executive Committee.    Our Executive Committee's primary function is to act upon matters when the Board of Directors is not in session. The Executive Committee has the full power and authority of the Board of Directors, except to the extent limited by law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other governance documents. 
      Board Structure and Lead Director.     Roger S. Penske is the Chair of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer. We believe the combination of these two offices represents the most appropriate approach for our company due to Mr. Penske's significant ownership position through Penske Corporation, his extensive automotive industry experience, his relationships with our key automotive partners and his experience as an executive and a director of some of the world's leading companies. In light of the combination of these positions, one of our governance principles is to have an independent "Lead Director." Our Lead Director is responsible for:
Our Lead Director is H. Brian Thompson. He may be contacted by leaving a message at the following telephone number: 800-469-1634. All messages will be reviewed by our Corporate Secretary's office and all (other than frivolous messages) will be forwarded to the Lead Director. Any written communications to the independent directors as a group or the entire Board of Directors may be sent care of the Corporate Secretary to our principal executive office. These communications (other than frivolous messages) will also be forwarded to the Lead Director. 
      Director Independence.     A majority of our Board of Directors is independent and each of the members of our audit, compensation and nominating committees is independent. The Board of Directors has determined that Mss. Davis, McWaters and Pierce and Messrs. Barr, Dürheimer, Smith, Steinhart and Thompson are each independent in accordance with the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and our guidelines for independent directors which can be found in our corporate governance guidelines on our website www.penskeautomotive.com and as set forth below. As required by New York Stock Exchange rules, our Board of Directors determined that no material relationship exists which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of the independent directors. 
For a director to be considered independent under our corporate governance guidelines, the Board of Directors must determine that the director does not have any direct or indirect  Table of Contents material relationship with us. In addition to applying these guidelines, the Board of Directors considers relevant facts and circumstances in making the determination of independence, and not merely from the standpoint of the director, but also from that of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. The Board considers the transactions, relationships and arrangements between the Company, and its affiliates such as Penske Corporation, Penske Racing and Penske Truck Leasing and affiliates of the director, including those described under "Related Party Transactions" and elsewhere in the proxy statement, in its independence determination. The Board also considers ownership of our or our affiliates' securities by the directors and their affiliates, ownership by our management team of any securities of affiliates of directors, sponsorships of Penske Racing by any of our or our directors' affiliates, and any direct or indirect investments in affiliates of Transportation Resource Partners, an affiliate of Penske Corporation. 
Under our guidelines, which are more stringent than the New York Stock Exchange guidelines, a director will not be independent if: 
      Risk Management.     We have designed and implemented processes to manage risk in our operations. The role of the Board of Directors in risk management is primarily one of oversight. Management is responsible for the implementation and execution of our risk management initiatives. Our Board of Directors executes its oversight role directly and also through its various committees as set forth below.

As part of its review of operational risk, the Board of Directors reviews cybersecurity risks facing our company, including the potential for breach of our key information technology systems and the potential for a breach of our systems and processes relating to the protection of customer and employee confidential information. The Board meets periodically with our Chief Information Officer and our Audit Committee reviews key risks, including these risks, at its regular meetings and reviews any significant cybersecurity incidents. 
      Director Advisor Program.     The Board has adopted a policy in its Corporate Governance Guidelines for the designation of certain former directors as "Director Advisors" which allows us to retain the benefits of continuing guidance from our long-tenured directors. This program is designed to encourage director renewal while retaining access to former long-tenured directors' valuable experience and institutional knowledge. Director Advisors are expected typically to be invited to attend two Board meetings per year and be available for continuing consultation. A Director Advisor is not entitled to attend any Board meeting, may not vote on any business coming before the Board nor is he or she counted as a member of the Board for the purpose of determining a quorum or for any other purpose. A Director Advisor is not a member of the Board or a "director" as that term is used in our bylaws, this proxy statement or otherwise. 
Director Advisors are entitled to cash compensation of $40,000 per year payable in cash or company stock at the director's election, and a charitable match opportunity and use of a company vehicle under the same terms as our director compensation program, as well as reimbursement of company expenses and travel to our meetings. In December 2018, the Board designated William Lovejoy, a member of our Board from 2004 to 2018, and Lucio Noto, a member of our Board from 2001 to 2018, as Director Advisors for 2019. 
      No Hedging or Short Selling.     Our securities trading policy applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and restricts trading in our securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. The policy prohibits our directors, officers, employees and their designees from engaging in hedging, short sales and other trading techniques that offset any decrease in market value of our equity securities without the approval of our General Counsel. No such approvals were requested in 2018. 
      Stock Ownership Guidelines/Pledging.     Our stock ownership guidelines, discussed in the CD&A below, require threshold levels of our stock to be held by executive officers, other senior officers and directors. These guidelines exclude any shares that are pledged by our directors and officers. 
      Controlled Company.     Under the New York Stock Exchange rules, if a company is "controlled" it need not have a majority of independent directors or solely independent compensation or nominating committees. We are a "controlled company" because more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by Penske Corporation through its voting agreement with Mitsui & Co. and their affiliates. These entities are considered a group due to the provisions of the stockholders agreement between these parties described under "Related Party Transactions." Even though we are a "controlled company," we are fully compliant with the New York Stock Exchange rules for non-controlled companies. 
      Director Candidates.     When considering new candidates for our Board of Directors, the  Table of Contents
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the network of contacts of the Board of Directors to compile potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The committee considers whether the nominee would be independent and meets with each candidate to discuss and consider his or her qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders pursuant to procedures outlined below. Stockholder proposals for nominees should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary, Penske Automotive Group, 2555 Telegraph Road, Bloomfield Hills, MI 48302. The committee's evaluation of stockholder-proposed candidates will be the same as for any other candidates. 
Director candidate submissions are to include:
Recommendations received by November 26, 2019, will be considered for nomination at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
      Location of Corporate Governance Documents.     Our corporate governance guidelines and the other documents referenced in this section are posted on our website, www.penskeautomotive.com, under the heading "Governance" within the "Investor Relations" section. We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees and directors. We intend to disclose waivers, if any, for our executive officers or directors from the code, and changes to the code, on our website. 
      Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our stock to file reports of ownership with the SEC. Our employees prepare these reports using information obtained from them and our records. Based solely on our review of such forms received by the Company and the written representations of the reporting persons, the Company has determined that no reporting persons known to the Company were delinquent with respect to their reporting obligations as set forth in Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in 2018. 
      Stockholder Nominations and Proposals for 2020.     We must receive any proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14(a)-8 of the SEC proxy rules intended to be presented to stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders at our principal executive offices at 2555 Telegraph Road, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48302 for inclusion in the proxy statement by November 20, 2019. These proposals must also meet other requirements of the rules of the SEC relating to stockholder proposals. Stockholders who intend to present an item of business at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 (other than a proposal submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement) must follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws and provide us notice of the business no later than February 9, 2020.

     Proposal 2 — Ratification of the Selection of our Independent Auditor   
[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firm of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates (collectively referred to as "Deloitte") as our principal independent auditing firm for 2019. We have determined to submit the selection of auditors to stockholder ratification, even though it is not required by our governing documents or Delaware law. If the selection of Deloitte as our independent auditor is not ratified by our stockholders, our Audit Committee will re-evaluate its selection, taking into consideration the stockholder vote on the ratification and the advisability of selecting new auditors prior to completion of the 2019 audit. 
Our Audit Committee is solely responsible for selecting, engaging and terminating our independent auditing firm, and may do so at any time at its discretion. It is anticipated that a representative of Deloitte will be present at the annual meeting with the opportunity to make a statement and to answer appropriate questions.

     AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of our accounting functions and internal controls as more fully discussed above under "Our Corporate Governance." The Audit Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate our independent auditing firm, and is responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors that our financial statements be included in our annual report on Form 10-K. 
The Audit Committee took a number of steps in making this recommendation for our 2018 annual report. The Audit Committee discussed with our independent auditing firm those matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including information regarding their independence and the scope and results of their audit. These communications and discussions were intended to assist the Audit Committee in overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process. The Audit Committee also discussed the independent auditing firm's independence and received the letters and written disclosures from the independent auditing firm required by the PCAOB. Finally, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the annual audited financial statements with our management and the independent auditing firm in advance of the public release of operating results, and before the filing of our annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Based on the foregoing, and such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that our audited financial statements be included in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019.

The Audit Committee has considered the nature of the above-listed services provided by Deloitte and determined that they are compatible with their provision of independent audit services under relevant guidance. The Audit Committee has discussed these services with Deloitte and management and determined that they are permitted under the Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the auditor independence requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the laws and regulations administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Pre-approval Policy.    The Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by Deloitte. The primary purpose of this policy is to ensure that we engage our public accountants with a view toward maintaining independence. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all services relating to work performed for us by Deloitte and related fees. The Audit Committee must also approve fees incurred for pre-approved services that are in excess of the approved amount. Pre-approval of audit and non-audit services and fees may be given at any time up to a year before commencement of the specified service. The Chair of the Audit Committee may independently approve fees and services as long as they are reviewed and ratified by the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

     Proposal 3 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
We annually seek a non-binding advisory vote on our executive compensation. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Compensation and Management Development Committee, however, the committee will take the outcome of the vote into account when making future executive compensation decisions. Last year, our stockholders approved the compensation of our named executive officers as described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation" with over 99% of the votes cast by our stockholders voting in favor. As we evaluated our compensation programs and practices, we were mindful of this strong shareholder support in deciding to maintain the overall framework of our compensation program and the majority of our compensation practices unchanged from last year. 
Our compensation program is designed to motivate our executive officers to enhance long-term stockholder value and to attract and retain the highest quality executive and key employee talent available. We believe our executive compensation is aligned with increasing the value of our common stock and promoting our key strategies, values and long term financial and operational objectives. In this regard, we note that:
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS APPROPRIATE AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE FOLLOWING ADVISORY RESOLUTION:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED."  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Named Executive Officers   
[END TABLE]
For 2018, our named executive officers, whose compensation we describe below, are Messrs. Penske, Kurnick, Carlson, Denker, and Spradlin. Each of these executive officers were elected by the Board of Directors and will hold office until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal from office. Biographies of Messrs. Kurnick and Penske are set forth above. Biographies of our other named executive officers are provided below: 
J.D. Carlson, 49, has served as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since June 2015 and prior to that served as our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller since May 2011. He previously served as our Vice President and Controller since joining our company in April 2006. Prior to joining us, Mr. Carlson was Corporate Controller for Tecumseh Products. He was previously a Senior Manager for PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and financial advisory services firm, which he joined in 1995. 
Bud Denker, 60, has served as our Executive Vice President — Human Resources since July 1, 2015. Since September 2017, he also has served as President of Penske Corporation, and he serves as Executive Vice President, Marketing and Communications of Penske Corporation as well as Executive Vice President of Penske Racing. Mr. Denker served as our Executive Vice President — Marketing from July 2005 to June 2015. Prior to joining us, Mr. Denker served as Vice President, Brand and Market Development for Eastman Kodak Company from 2001-2005. 
Shane M. Spradlin, 49, has served as our Executive Vice President since February 2010, our General Counsel since December 2007, and our Corporate Secretary since March 2004. Mr. Spradlin joined our Company in March 2003. From 1999 to 2003, he served as Corporate Counsel to Nextel Communications in Reston, Virginia. From 1995 through 1999, Mr. Spradlin was an associate with the New York and Washington, D.C. offices of Latham & Watkins, specializing in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions.

     Compensation Committee Report   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below with management. Based on this review and these discussions with management, the committee has recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Disclosure and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

     Compensation Discussion and Analysis   
[END TABLE]
       Compensation Philosophy.     Other than with respect to Messrs. Kurnick and Penske, the majority of our executive and employee compensation is payable in cash in the short-term, and is comprised principally of salary and cash bonuses. We use cash compensation as the majority of our compensation because we believe it provides the most flexibility for our employees and is less dilutive to existing stockholders than equity compensation. The compensation committee also recognizes that stock prices may reflect factors other than long-term performance, such as general economic conditions and varying attitudes among investors toward the stock market in general and toward automotive retail companies specifically. However, we also provide long-term compensation in the form of restricted stock awards for senior employees, including each of our named executive officers. Our restricted stock program awards typically vest over four years, with 70% of any award vesting in the third and fourth years. We believe this long term compensation helps to align management's goals with those of our other stockholders and provides a long-term retention inducement for our key employees, as discussed below under the heading "Incentive Equity Awards." 
      Outside Advisors and Consultants.     Our compensation committee has full access to any of our employees and has the authority to hire outside consultants and advisors at its discretion, though it did not do so in 2018. Notwithstanding management's participation in the executive compensation process, all named executive officer compensation determinations are made by the committee, using its independent judgment and analysis. 
      Role of Executive Officers.     The compensation committee relies on our senior management to assist in fulfilling many of its duties, in particular our Executive Vice President — Human Resources and Chief Executive Officer, each of whom attends part of most committee meetings. These executives make recommendations concerning our compensation policies generally, certain specific elements of compensation for senior management (such as equity awards and bonuses), and report to the committee as to company personnel and developments. Our Chief Executive Officer also makes specific compensation recommendations concerning our other executive officers and certain other employees. Our Chief Executive Officer does not participate in determining his own compensation. 
      Addressing Risk.     Our compensation committee recognizes that any incentive based compensation arrangement induces an inherent element of risk taking by senior management. We incent management through annual discretionary bonuses, restricted stock grants and, in some cases, performance based bonuses. The committee assesses the risk related to our compensation policies for the named executive officers and for the employees generally, and has determined that our compensation arrangements do not lend themselves to unnecessary or excessive risk taking. The committee believes that any inherent risk is mitigated by the following factors:
The responsibilities of the compensation committee and committee member independence are described under "Our Corporate Governance" beginning on page 7. 
      Compensation Recovery ("Clawback") Policy.     We have a policy regarding the recovery of unfairly earned compensation.  Table of Contents
Under the policy, if our Board determines that a member of management earned performance based compensation or incentive compensation within the last three years due to fraud, negligence or intentional misconduct, and such conduct was a significant contributing factor to our restating our financial statements or the reporting of material inaccuracies relating to financial reporting or other performance metrics used in those awards, our Board has the discretion to cause that employee to repay and/or forfeit all compensation that was expressly conditioned upon the achievement of the misreported financial results. 
      Equity Award Approval Policy.     We have an equity award approval policy which requires that all equity awards be approved by the committee and that the grant date of all awards except those discussed below shall be the date of the approval by the committee. As part of that policy, the compensation committee delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant awards of up to an aggregate of 50,000 shares of our common stock (or stock equivalents) for new hires or spot awards, other than to executive officers, provided that the awards are reported to the committee at its next meeting. Our compensation committee believes that this delegation of authority allows us to meet our ongoing business needs in a practical manner. Our Chief Executive Officer approved awards for 5,262 shares under that authority in 2018, which awards were ratified by the committee. 
      Stock Ownership Guidelines.     Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to align our management and Board members' interests with our stockholders. The guidelines require that officers and directors own the following levels of common stock, expressed as a multiple of base salary. 
Non-employee board members are required to own common stock equal to five times our annual retainer (currently, $40,000 × 5= $200,000). Directors and officers have until the later of five years from adoption of the policy or appointment, to reach the minimum ownership level, though our policy allows extensions at the discretion of the Chair and Lead Director. These guidelines exclude any shares that are pledged by any of our directors and officers, and also include any shares of restricted stock held by the officer or director. 
      Determination of Compensation Amounts.     The compensation committee reviews and determines all aspects of compensation for our named executive officers. In making decisions regarding non-CEO compensation, the committee receives input from our Chief Executive Officer. The committee believes that solely using annual quantitative performance measurements does not create the appropriate balance of incentives to build long-term value. Thus, the committee evaluates a broad range of qualitative factors, including reliability, a track record of integrity, good judgment, foresight and the ability to lead others. 
The committee reviews salary adjustments with a view to maintaining external compensation competitiveness. We annually benchmark competitiveness of our total compensation against a group of publicly traded automotive retailers (Asbury Automotive Group, AutoNation, CarMax, Group 1 Automotive, Lithia Motors and Sonic Automotive). While we benchmark our compensation, we do not target a specific quartile of pay for our named executive officers as compared to our peers. 
In addition to the above mentioned factors, the level of compensation that we pay to Messrs. Denker and Kurnick reflect that each devotes a percentage of his time to affiliated companies for which they receive additional compensation from Penske Corporation. Specifically, Mr. Kurnick serves as Penske Corporation's Vice Chair and Mr. Denker serves as the President of Penske Corporation. Our committee does not track the exact percentage of time spent on Penske Automotive versus affiliated matters, recognizing that the amount  Table of Contents varies from year to year, but it is generally expected that each will spend approximately 75% of his time on Penske Automotive matters. In determining the amount of compensation that we pay, our compensation committee considers the impact of the time each spends on Penske Automotive matters. We were reimbursed approximately four percent of Mr. Spradlin's base salary by Penske Corporation to reflect his efforts on behalf of Penske Corporation. The full amount of Mr. Spradlin's base salary is shown in the table below. 
 Our Compensation Program.    Our compensation program primarily consists of four elements:
      Base Salary.     The salaries of our named executive officers are determined by scope of job responsibility, experience, individual performance, historical salary levels and the benchmarking information discussed above. The committee approves salary levels for named executive officers and certain key employees in order to maintain external compensation competitiveness using the benchmarks noted above, and to reflect the performance of those employees in the prior year and to reflect any change in the employee's responsibilities. The evaluation of the individual's performance is based upon the committee's subjective perception of that individual's performance, based in large part on input from our Chief Executive Officer with respect to each of the other named executive officers, and the factors noted above under "Determination of Compensation Amounts." 
The committee also considers our Company-wide performance in the prior year and general economic factors when setting base salary levels for each of the named executive officers. The items of corporate performance that are considered for our named executive officers are the same as those with respect to the award detailed below under "Long-Term Incentive Plans." Our compensation committee uses these factors in a subjective evaluation to gauge Company performance, keeping in mind the impact of the general performance of the automotive retail industry. In July 2018, Messrs. Carlson, Denker and Spradlin each received an increase in salary to $575,000 resulting from the Committee's review of the factors noted above. 
      Annual Bonus Payments.     Our senior management is eligible to receive annual discretionary cash bonus payments. In the past several years, our Chief Executive Officer and President have not received any discretionary bonus payments, and instead receive only the restricted stock grants resulting from their achievement of performance goals, as described below under "Long-Term Incentive Plans." We pay annual cash bonuses to our other named executive officers to provide an incentive for future performance and as a reward for performance during the prior year. These discretionary bonus payments are determined in varying degrees based on three criteria:
The items of Company-wide performance that are considered for our named executive officers are the same as those detailed below under "Long-Term Incentive Plans." Our compensation committee uses these factors in a subjective evaluation to gauge Company performance, keeping in mind the impact of the overall performance of the business sectors in which we compete. The evaluation of the individual's performance and the performance of the individual's business unit is based on the committee's perception of that performance, based in part on input from our Chief Executive Officer and the factors noted above under "Determination of Compensation Amounts."  Table of Contents
      Restricted Stock Awards.     Each member of senior management, including each of the named executive officers, is eligible to receive a restricted stock award because we believe these awards effectively align management's goals with those of our other stockholders. Restricted stock grants for management typically vest over four years at a rate of 15%, 15%, 20% and 50% per year, and are subject to forfeiture in the event the employee departs from the Company before vesting. We believe these awards provide a longer-term incentive for management because the majority of the award vests in the third and fourth year. We employ this form of compensation in part because many of our initiatives may take several years to yield benefits. We also believe that weighted vesting of these awards provides an additional incentive to retain our valuable employees due to the unvested value that may be created over time. Our restricted stock awards mirror our other outstanding stock, including the right to vote with our other stockholders and receive dividends. 
The restricted shares that we issued to Messrs. Carlson, Denker and Spradlin in 2018 were discretionary based upon the awards granted in the prior year adjusted to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the named executive officers, the individual's performance and Company-wide performance measures detailed below under "Long-Term Incentive Plans," keeping in mind the overall performance of the business sectors in which we compete. The amounts are also established to induce retention, as the awards are the sole aspect of long-term compensation for our named executive officers. Starting in 2019, the grants for Messrs. Carlson, Denker and Spradlin were based on pre-established performance goals during the prior fiscal year 2018 noted below. 
In total in 2018, the committee approved the grant of approximately 353,593 equity incentive awards under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (representing approximately 0.4% of our current outstanding equity), including all of the awards to our named executive officers. Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides up to four million shares for equity awards and terminates on May 5, 2020. After the grants made in 2018, we have 2,825,133 shares (giving effect to certain forfeitures and shares withheld) available for awards under the plan. 
      Other Compensation.     We may also provide our named executive officers, and certain other employees, with selected other benefits or perquisites in order to attract and retain them. With respect to health and welfare benefits, the committee believes that our employees should receive a meaningful benefit package commensurate with those of other automotive retailers, recognizing the increasing cost of those benefits in recent years. We also provide our U.S. employees with company matching under our 401(k) plan. The amounts received by the named executive offers in this regard are set forth in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation" table below 
Our named executive officers, as well as other eligible employees, may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their bonus compensation pursuant to the Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2018 (the "DCP"). The DCP is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan which provides the opportunity to accumulate additional savings for retirement on a tax deferred basis. The Company does not match funds deferred through this plan. Additional details regarding our DCP can be found below in the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table. 
Our named executive officers and directors are also provided with an automobile allowance or the use of a company vehicle. From time to time, we may provide other benefits to certain members of our senior management, such as payment for a country club membership or tax gross-ups for certain items. We have valued these benefits in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation" table below based on our cost. We review these benefits on a case-by-case basis and believe, if limited in scope, such benefits can provide an incentive to long term performance and help retain our valuable employees. 
      No Employment Agreements or Pre-arranged Severance Compensation.     None of our current executive officers have  Table of Contents been provided an employment agreement, nor are they entitled to any pre-arranged severance compensation. We believe our mix of short-term and long-term compensation provides a retention incentive that makes an employment contract unnecessary, while providing us flexibility with respect to managing the departure of an executive officer. Our lack of pre-arranged severance compensation is consistent with our performance based compensation philosophy, and provides us the flexibility to enter into post-employment arrangements based on circumstances existing upon departure. We have historically entered into varying types of severance arrangements with departing members of our senior management, which have included vesting of restricted stock and consulting agreements, as we believe it may be important to have continuing access to these individuals' knowledge base and guidance. In the event we employ consulting agreements, we have typically obtained a non-compete agreement with these individuals. With respect to a change in control, none of our current executive officers have been guaranteed any change of control payments, however, our outstanding restricted stock grants provide that in the event of a change of control, the award will vest. 
   Long Term Incentive Plans  
Our compensation committee established 2018 performance targets for a performance based award for each of named executive officers in February 2018. The threshold payouts (50% of target), target payouts (100% of target) and maximum payouts (150% of target) are each set forth in the table below and were paid in shares of restricted stock in February 2019 as set forth below. 
Each of the officers' achievement is noted below, which entitled them to the amount of restricted stock noted below granted in February 2019 calculated by dividing the total award achieved by our average closing stock price for each trading day in 2018 ($47.42271), vesting over a four year period. Messrs. Kurnick and Penske did not receive an annual cash bonus because they each received this restricted stock grant in lieu of a cash bonus.

   Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  
The Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") allows qualifying individuals, including our named executive officers, to defer on a pre-tax basis up to 50% of their base salary and/or up to 100% of their annual bonus until their retirement or separation from the Company. The deferred assets are held in a rabbi trust and are invested on behalf of the participants in investments managed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). In the event of termination of employment, all balances would be paid in either a lump sum or up to ten annual installments, according to the employee's prior election. We do not provide any matching contributions and we do not guarantee a minimum return on these amounts. All gains and losses shown in the table below resulted from the investments managed by CIBC. 
We believe the DCP is an important tool for recruiting key employees and assists in employee retention. The table below reflects the contributions, earnings, withdrawals and distributions during 2018, and the account balances as of December 31, 2018 for each named executive officer under the DCP.

   Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  
Our executive officers are not eligible to participate in any defined benefit compensation plans. The Penske Automotive Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") discussed above allows participants the opportunity to accumulate additional savings for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. For a more detailed discussion of the DCP, please see the section entitled "Executive Compensation — Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
   "Golden Parachutes" or Termination/Change in Control Payments  
None of our current named executive officers have been provided an employment agreement, nor are they entitled to any pre-arranged severance compensation. With respect to a change in control, none of our current named executive officers have been guaranteed any change of control payments, however, our outstanding restricted stock grants provide that in the event of a change of control the award will vest. Based on a closing stock price of $42.38 on March12, 2019, the following number of shares would vest assuming a change of control occurred on that date: Roger Penske 344,730 shares ($14,609,657), Robert Kurnick 68,809 shares ($2,916,125), Shane Spradlin 31,356 shares ($1,328,867), J.D. Carlson 28,047 shares ($1,188,632) and Bud Denker 26,297 shares ($1,114,467). 
      CEO Pay Ratio.     As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and applicable SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Roger S. Penske, our Chief Executive Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2018:
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Penske to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was estimated to be 168 to 1. 
Pursuant to SEC rules, we are permitted to calculate our CEO pay ratio for the year ended December 31, 2018 using the same median employee that we identified in 2017 because we do not believe that there have been any changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during 2018 that would have a significant impact on our pay ratio disclosure. However, due to changes in the annual compensation of the median employee that we identified in 2017, we believe that using such individual as our median employee for 2018 would result in a significant change to our pay ratio. As a result, and as permitted by SEC guidance, we substituted a different employee whose 2017 compensation was substantially similar to that of our 2017 median employee to be our median employee for purposes of calculating our ratio for 2018. 
We identified our median employee in 2017 as of December 31, 2017, when our worldwide employee population consisted of approximately 26,300 individuals. In identifying the median employee, we excluded from our employee population all of the employees in the following jurisdictions as permitted by SEC rules and interpretations based on the small number of employees located in each: Canada (219), New Zealand (85) and Italy (535). To identify our 2017 median employee from our employee population,  Table of Contents we then compared the amount of U.S. gross taxable wages or equivalent foreign metric of our employees as reflected in our payroll records. The individual that we selected to be our 2018 median employee had gross taxable wages (or the foreign equivalent) in 2017 that was substantially similar to our 2017 median employee. 
We combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the SEC's requirements, resulting in annual total compensation of $40,720. With respect to the annual total compensation of Mr. Penske, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.

     Director Compensation   
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors believes that its members should receive a mix of cash and equity compensation, with the option to receive certain compensation in the form of equity. The Board of Directors approves changes to director compensation only upon the recommendation of the Compensation and Management Development Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors. Although all of our directors are eligible for our charitable donation matching program discussed below, only those directors who are not our employees are eligible for director compensation. 
      Annual Fee and Stock Award.     Each non-employee director receives an annual fee of $40,000, except for audit committee members, who receive $45,000. Beginning in 2018,  the Lead Director received an additional $50,000 up from $25,000 in 2017 and committee chairs received an additional $10,000, up from $5,000 in 2017. These increases were based largely on our annual peer benchmarking of director fees. These fees are payable, at the option of each non-employee director, in cash or common stock valued on the date of receipt (generally in the fourth quarter of the year of service). Our non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of 4,000 shares of stock. 
      Option to Defer Receipt until Termination of Board Service.     Under our Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan, the annual fee and equity awards earned by our non-employee directors may be deferred in either cash (for the annual fee) and/or deferred stock. Each deferred stock unit is equal in value to a share of common stock, and ultimately will be paid in cash after a director retires. These stock units do not have voting rights, but do receive dividends in the form of additional stock units which are credited to the director's account on the date dividends are paid. All cash fees deferred are held in our general funds, and interest on such deferred fees is credited to the director's account at the then current U.S. 90-day Treasury bill rate on a quarterly basis. 
      Charitable Donation Matching Program.     All directors are eligible to participate in a charitable matching gift program. Under this program, in 2018 we matched up to $50,000 per year in contributions by each director to institutions qualified as tax-exempt organizations under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and other institutions approved at the discretion of management. We may decline to match any contribution to an institution with goals that are incompatible with ours, or due to conflicts with our director independence policy. This program is not available for matching of political contributions. While the contributions are directed by our directors, we retain the tax deduction for matching contributions paid by us. 
      Other Amounts.     As part of our director continuing education program, each director is eligible to be reimbursed by us for the cost and expenses relating to one education seminar per year. These amounts are excluded from the table below. Each non-employee director is also entitled to the use of a company vehicle, including the cost of routine maintenance and repairs and company-sponsored automobile insurance relating to that vehicle. Beginning in 2018, for any director who declines the use of a company-sponsored vehicle, we provided a $20,000 cash payment in lieu of the company-sponsored vehicle. All directors are also entitled to reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with their travel to, and attendance at, meetings of the Board of Directors or its committees. Because we expect attendance at all meetings, and a substantial portion of the Board of Directors' work is done outside of formal meetings, we do not pay meeting fees.  Table of Contents
    2018 Director Compensation Table         
Our directors serving in 2018 who were also our employees (Messrs. Kurnick, Penske, Sasaki and Yamanaka) receive no additional compensation for serving as directors, though they are eligible for the charitable matching program noted above.

     Related Party Transactions   
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy with respect to the approval of related party transactions. Under the policy, related party transactions valued over $5,000 must be approved by a majority of either the members of our Audit Committee or our disinterested Board members. Our Audit Committee approves all individual related party transactions valued below $1 million, all multiple-payment transactions valued below $5 million (such as a lease), and any transaction substantially similar to a prior year's transaction (regardless of amount). Our Board, by a vote of the disinterested directors, reviews and approves all other related party transactions. At each regularly scheduled meeting, our Audit Committee reviews any proposed new related party transactions for approval and reviews the status of previously approved transactions. Each of the transactions noted below was approved by our Board of Directors or Audit Committee pursuant to this policy. 
      Stockholders Agreement.     Entities affiliated with Roger S. Penske, our Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, are parties to a stockholders agreement described below. Mr. Penske is also Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Penske Corporation, and, through entities affiliated with Penske Corporation, our largest stockholder. The parties to the stockholders agreement are Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsui & Co, (USA), Inc. (collectively, "Mitsui"), Penske Corporation and Penske Automotive Holdings Corp. (collectively the "Penske companies"). 
Pursuant to the stockholders agreement, the Penske companies agreed to vote their shares for up to two directors who are representatives of Mitsui and Mitsui agreed to vote its shares for up to fourteen directors voted for by the Penske companies. In addition, the Penske companies agreed that if they transfer any of our shares of common stock, Mitsui would be entitled to "tag along" by transferring a pro rata amount of its shares upon similar terms and conditions, subject to certain limitations. On March 27, 2018, the Penske companies and Mitsui entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which the parties amended certain provisions of the Stockholders Agreement to extend the term by six years through March 26, 2030, or earlier, upon the mutual consent of the parties or when either party no longer owns any of our common stock. 
On December 12, 2018, we entered into an agreement with Mitsui to renew Mitsui's right to (1) an observer at all of our Board of Directors meetings so long as Mitsui owns at least 2.5% of our outstanding common stock, and (2) appoint a senior executive so long as Mitsui owns at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. 
      Registration Rights Agreements.     Both the Penske companies and Mitsui possess registration rights pursuant to which they are able on two remaining occasions each to register all or part of our common stock held by them, subject to specified limitations. They are also entitled to request inclusion of all or any part of their common stock in any registration of securities by us on Forms S-1 or S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
      Other Related Party Interests.     Several of our directors and officers are affiliated with Penske Corporation or related entities. Mr. Penske is a managing member of certain investment vehicles of Transportation Resource Partners, an organization that undertakes investments in transportation-related industries. Roger S. Penske, Jr., Roger Penske's son, is one of our directors. Robert Kurnick, our President and a Director, is also the Vice Chair and a Director of Penske Corporation. Mr. Denker, our Executive Vice President — Human Resources is the President of Penske Corporation. Mr. Eisenson, one of our directors, is a director of Penske Corporation. In 2018, we were reimbursed approximately four percent of the base salary of Shane Spradlin, our General Counsel, by Penske Corporation to reflect his efforts on behalf of Penske Corporation affiliates. These employees or directors may receive salary, bonus or other compensation from Penske Corporation or its affiliates unrelated to their  Table of Contents service at Penske Automotive. Lucio A. Noto, one of our former directors and a Director Advisor, is an investor in Transportation Resource Partners. 
      Penske Truck Leasing.     We own an approximately 28.9% interest in Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. ("PTL"), a leading provider of transportation services and supply chain management. PTL is capable of meeting customers' needs across the supply chain with a broad product offering that includes full-service truck leasing, truck rental and contract maintenance, along with logistics services such as dedicated contract carriage, distribution center management, transportation management and lead logistics provider. PTL is owned 41.1% by Penske Corporation, 28.9% by us, and 30% by affiliates of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. 
The PTL partnership agreement, among other things, provides us with specified partner distribution and governance rights and restricts our ability to transfer our interest. In addition, the partnership has a six member advisory committee and we are entitled to one of the representatives serving on the advisory committee. We have the right to pro rata quarterly distributions equal to 50% of PTL's consolidated net income and we expect to realize significant cash tax savings. 
We may transfer our directly owned interests with the unanimous consent of the other partners, or if we provide the remaining partners with a right of first offer to acquire our interests, except that we may transfer up to 9.02% of our interest to Penske Corporation without complying with the right of first offer to the remaining partner. We and Penske Corporation have previously agreed that (1) in the event of any transfer by Penske Corporation of their partnership interests to a third party, we will be entitled to "tag-along" by transferring a pro rata amount of our partnership interests on similar terms and conditions, and (2) Penske Corporation is entitled to a right of first refusal in the event of any transfer of our partnership interests, subject to the terms of the partnership agreement. Additionally, PTL has agreed to indemnify the general partner for any actions in connection with managing PTL, except those taken in bad faith or in violation of the partnership agreement. 
The partnership agreement allows Penske Corporation to give notice to require PTL to begin to effect an initial public offering of equity securities, subject to certain limitations, as soon as practicable after the first anniversary of the initial notice, and, beginning in 2025, we and Mitsui continue to have a similar right to require PTL to begin an initial public offering of equity securities, subject to certain limitations, as soon as reasonably practicable. A portion of our existing PTL ownership interests were previously held through a limited liability company, LJVP Holdings LLC ("Holdings"). In March 2018, we redeemed our interests in Holdings for equivalent interests in PTL directly. 
In 2018, we received $63.2 million from PTL in pro rata cash distributions. Our Chair and Chief Executive Officer also serves as Chair of PTL, for which he is compensated by PTL. As a limited partner, we do not influence or control the amount of that compensation. In 2018, our subsidiary operating retail commercial truck dealerships, Premier Truck Group, assisted in providing customer financing arrangements at several PTL used truck sales centers in the United States and Canada. In 2018, we received $1.9 million for providing these services. 
Our Australian subsidiary, Penske Transportation Group International owns a 28.33% interest in a joint venture with a PTL subsidiary to lease trucks in Australia and New Zealand. The joint venture combines our sales expertise in Australia with PTL's truck leasing experience. We continue to be party to a stockholder's agreement relating to this investment that provides us with specified distribution and governance rights and restricts our ability to transfer our interests. 
      Other Transactions.     From time to time, we pay and/or receive fees from Penske Corporation and its affiliates for services rendered in the normal course of business, including payments to third parties by Penske Corporation on our behalf which we then reimburse to them, payments to third parties made by us on behalf of Penske Corporation  Table of Contents which they then reimburse to us, shared office expenses, shared employee expenses and payments relating to the use of aircraft from Penske Aviation, a subsidiary of Penske Corporation.

Aggregate payments relating to such transactions amounted to $6.0 million paid by us in 2018. 
In June 2008, RP Automotive, an affiliate of Mr. Penske, Jr., purchased two of our subsidiaries operating six franchises in California. In connection with these transactions, the former subsidiaries continue to lease certain fixed assets from us. One of the leases has a term expiring in December 2037 with annual rent of $289,000 per year (or $5.5 million over the remaining period), and the second lease has a term expiring in February 2027 with annual rent of $219,000 per year (or $1.8 million over the remaining period). 
We entered into a license agreement with an affiliate of Penske Corporation for a license of the "Penske Automotive" name. This agreement provides us with a perpetual license of the name "Penske Automotive" and related trade names so long as Penske Corporation and its affiliates own in excess of 20% of our outstanding common stock and we adhere to the other terms of the license agreement. In 2017, we entered into a two-year marketing arrangement with an affiliate of Jay Penske, Roger S. Penske's son, under which we agreed to incur approximately $600,000 for marketing and subscription services over the two-year period, $263,000 of which was payable in 2018.

These arrangements are reviewed by the Board in accordance with our policy noted above. For example, we aggregate several Penske entities in connection with sourcing certain telecommunications services to achieve the benefits of scale. 
On March 27, 2018, we repurchased 1,133,016 shares of our outstanding common stock from Mitsui for $50.0 million, or $44.13 per share, under our securities repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors. 
Our officers, directors and their affiliates periodically purchase, lease or sell vehicles and parts from us or PTL at fair market value.

Additionally, we hire service technicians who have graduated from Universal Technical Institute ("UTI"), a provider of technical education, whose Chief Executive Officer, Kimberly McWaters, is one of our directors. We generally make no payments to UTI relating to the hiring of these graduates and hire them on the same terms as other employers. 
Mr. Sasaki, one of our former directors, received $359,684 in total compensation relating to his service as Senior Vice President — International Business Development, including a tax allowance of $12,700 relating to $46,984 of non-cash compensation.

To the extent his salary exceeded or was less than an amount set annually by Mitsui, he made or received payments to/from Mitsui intended to mitigate the effect of exchange rate changes. 
On December 12, 2018, we entered into a Services Agreement with Mitsui under which Mitsui employee Masashi Yamanaka, one of our directors, assisted the Company in strategic development of business opportunities and relationships in transportation related industries and the evaluation of new technologies in the automotive and trucking sectors. From January 9, 2019, to February 28, 2019, we paid a fee of $49,583 for these services.
