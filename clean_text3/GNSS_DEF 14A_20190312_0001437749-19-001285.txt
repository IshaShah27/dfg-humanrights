PROXY STATEMENTFOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To be held on March 12, 2019
INFORMATION CONCERNING SOLICITATION AND THE ANNUAL MEETING
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card are being furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of LRAD Corporation, a Delaware corporation, of proxies for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on March 12, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. local time (the "Annual Meeting"), or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held at our principal offices located at 16262 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, California 92127.
We intend to mail or electronically deliver this Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card and Notice of Annual Meeting on or about January 30, 2019 to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING THE ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT
What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. Richard S. Danforth, Chief Executive Officer, and Dennis D. Klahn, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary (the "proxyholders"), have been designated as proxies for the Annual Meeting.
What is a Proxy Statement?
A Proxy Statement is a document that the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating the proxyholders as proxies to vote on your behalf. The Proxy Statement includes information about the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting and other required disclosures including information about our Board and executive officers.
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting?
We have designated a record date of January 15, 2019 for the Annual Meeting. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on January 15, 2019, we had outstanding and entitled to vote 32,612,101 shares of common stock. On all matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting, each holder of record of common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held. All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.
Stockholder of Record – Shares Registered in Your Name
If, at the close of business on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Issuer Direct Corporation, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to ensure your vote is counted by submitting your proxy by signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided or by voting via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card. Simply follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card for each voting method.
Beneficial Owner – Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker, Bank or Other Agent
If, at the close of business on the record date, your shares were not held in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or other agent, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "Street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other agent. The broker, bank or other agent holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy issued in your name from your broker, bank or other agent. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will nevertheless have discretion to vote your shares on "routine" matters. Your broker will not have discretion to vote on "non-routine" matters absent direction from you. The election of directors (Proposal 1) and the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 3) are considered "non-routine" under applicable rules. The ratification of the appointment of Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal 2) is considered "routine" under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore there may be broker non-votes on these proposals.
How can I attend the Annual Meeting?
You will be admitted to the Annual Meeting if you were a stockholder as of the close of business on January 15, 2019, or you have authority to vote under a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting. You should be prepared to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, for admittance. In addition, if you are a stockholder of record, your name will be verified against the list of stockholders of record prior to admittance to the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, you must provide proof of beneficial ownership on the record date, such as your most recent account statement prior to January 15, 2019, a copy of the voting instruction form provided by your broker, trustee or nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership.
What proposals will be presented at the Annual Meeting?
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders eligible to vote will consider and vote upon (1) the election of six directors to serve for the ensuing year and until their successors are elected, (2) the ratification of the appointment of Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, (3) an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers and (4) such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
How does the board recommend I vote on these proposals?
Our Board's recommendations are set forth, together with a description of the proposals, in this Proxy Statement. In summary, our Board of Directors recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR each of the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement to serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2020 and until their successors are duly elected and qualified (see page 4);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (see page 11);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the approval of the compensation of our executive officers (see page 12);  
[END TABLE]
What vote is required to approve each matter and how are votes counted?
If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, the votes required for the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting and the treatment of abstentions and broker non-votes in respect of such proposals are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Election of Directors. The six nominees for director receiving the highest number of votes FOR election will be elected as directors. This is called a plurality. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are not counted for purposes of electing directors and will have no effect on the results of this vote. You may vote either FOR all of the nominees, WITHHOLD your vote from all of the nominees or WITHHOLD your vote from any one or more of the nominees. Votes that are withheld will not be included in the vote tally for the election of directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ratification of Squar Milner LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required to ratify Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Abstentions will count as present and entitled to vote for purposes of this proposal and will have the effect of votes against this proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on this proposal and, as a result, broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advisory vote on executive compensation. The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. Abstentions will count as present and entitled to vote for purposes of this proposal and will have the effect of votes against this proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on this proposal and, as a result, broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote?
It is important that your shares are represented at the Annual Meeting, whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting in person. To make sure that your shares are represented, we urge you to vote as promptly as possible by signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided or by voting via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card.
If you are a stockholder of record, there are four ways to vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By calling the toll-free telephone number indicated on your proxy card. Follow the voice prompts to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By going to the Internet website indicated on your proxy card. As with telephone voting, you can confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By signing, dating and returning the accompanying proxy card, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By written ballot at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other agent. In most cases, you may submit voting instructions by telephone or by Internet to your bank, broker or other agent, or you can sign, date and return a voting instruction form to your bank, broker or other agent. If you provide specific voting instructions by telephone, by Internet or by mail, your bank, broker or other agent must vote your shares as you have directed.
At the Annual Meeting, we will provide ballots to anyone who wishes to vote in person. If you hold your shares in street name, you must request a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee to vote by ballot at the Annual Meeting.
How can I change or revoke my vote?
You can revoke your proxy at any time before the applicable vote at the Annual Meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any of the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may submit another properly executed proxy by telephone, by Internet or by signing, dating and returning a later dated proxy card,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at 16262 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, California 92127, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person (however, simply attending the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy).  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent, follow the instructions provided by them.
How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if at least a majority of the outstanding shares as of the close of business on the record date are represented by stockholders present at the meeting or by proxy. At the close of business on the record date, there were 32,612,101 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Therefore, in order for a quorum to exist, 16,306,051 shares must be represented by stockholders present at the meeting or by proxy. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other agent) or if you vote in person at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement.
What if a quorum is not present at the meeting?
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the Annual Meeting, we may adjourn the meeting, either with or without the vote of the stockholders. If we propose to have the stockholders vote whether to adjourn the meeting, the proxyholders will vote all shares for which they have authority in favor of the adjournment. We may also adjourn the meeting if for any reason we believe that additional time should be allowed for the solicitation of proxies. An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the Annual Meeting.
What if I do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy?
If you indicate a choice on your proxy on a particular matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted as indicated. If you are a stockholder of record and you return a signed proxy card but do not indicate how you wish to vote, the proxyholders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board of Directors on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the proxyholders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you do not return a proxy card, your shares will not be voted and will not be deemed present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists.
If you are a beneficial owner and the organization holding your account does not receive instructions from you as to how to vote those shares, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, that organization may exercise discretionary authority to vote on routine proposals but may not vote on "non-routine" proposals. As a beneficial owner, you will not be deemed to have voted on such "non-routine" proposals. The shares that cannot be voted by brokers on "non-routine" matters are called broker non-votes. Broker non-votes will be deemed present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the Annual Meeting. The election of directors (Proposal 1), and the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 3) are considered "non-routine" under applicable rules. The ratification of the appointment of Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal 2) is considered "routine" under applicable rules.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
If you hold your shares in more than one account, you will receive a proxy card for each account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please sign, date and return the proxy card for each account or vote via the Internet or by telephone following the instructions provided on the proxy card for each account.
How will voting on any other business be conducted?
Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement, if any other business properly comes before the Annual Meeting, your proxy or voting instruction gives authority to the proxyholders to vote on those matters in their discretion.
May I propose matters for consideration at next year's annual meeting or nominate individuals to serve as directors?
Yes. If you wish to propose a matter for consideration at next year's annual meeting or if you wish to nominate a person for election as one of our directors, see the information set forth in "Stockholder Proposals" and "Stockholder Nominations" below.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting?
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days following the Annual Meeting.
Where can I access an electronic copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018?
You may access an electronic copy of the Proxy Statement, form of proxy card, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 at: www.proxyvote.com.
PROPOSAL ONEELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Nominees
The Board of Directors currently consists of six directors, all of whom were elected to our Board of Directors at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Each director to be elected will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and has qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. The Board, upon recommendation by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has nominated the nominees listed below for election to our Board of Directors.
We encourage our Board members to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. All nominees attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
Nomination Process
In considering candidates for election to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to assemble a Board that, as a whole, possesses the appropriate balance of professional, management and industry experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, expertise and involvement in areas that are of importance to our business and professional reputation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers other board service, business, financial and strategic judgment of potential nominees, and desires to have a Board that represents a diverse mix of backgrounds, perspectives and expertise consisting of directors who complement and strengthen the skills of other directors and who also exhibit integrity, collegiality, sound business judgment and any other qualities that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee views as critical to effective functioning of the Board. Each of the nominees for election to the Board has demonstrated a successful track record of strategic, business and financial planning and operating skills. In addition, each of the nominees for election to the Board has experience in management and leadership development and an understanding of operating and corporate governance issues for a public company such as LRAD Corporation.
Voting
Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the six nominees named below. In the event that any nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as management may propose. Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected, and management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve. There are no arrangements or understandings between us and any other person pursuant to which they or any other director has been selected as a director or nominee at the Annual Meeting.
The six candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast at the meeting will be elected directors.
For the reasons set forth in this Proxy Statement, and in particular, each nominee's qualifications and experience described below, the Board unanimously recommends a vote IN FAVOR of each of the Board's nominees for director.
Nominees
The names of the nominees and certain information about them are set forth below. Such information includes their present positions, principal occupations and public company directorships held in the past five years as well as the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each nominee that led the Board to believe that, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, the nominee is qualified to serve on the Board. However, each member of the Board may have a variety of reasons for believing a particular person would be an appropriate Board member, and these views may differ from the views of other members of the Board.

The corporate governance page can be found at www.lradx.com by clicking on "Investors," and then on "Governance." The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into and does not form a part of this Proxy Statement.
Our policies and practices reflect corporate governance initiatives that are designed to be compliant with the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the corporate governance requirements of applicable securities laws, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of our Board members are independent of our company and our management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of our standing Board committees are independent of our company and our management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independent members of our Board meet regularly without the presence of management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have a clear code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our principal executive officers, our directors and all of our employees, and is monitored by our Audit Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The charters of the Board committees clearly establish their respective roles and responsibilities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have a hotline available to all employees, and our Audit Committee has procedures in place for the anonymous submission of employee complaints on accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters.  
[END TABLE]
Board of Directors 
Our Board currently consists of six directors: General John G. Coburn (Chair), Scott L. Anchin, Laura M. Clague, Richard S. Danforth, Daniel H. McCollum, and Richard H. Osgood III. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, our Board held six meetings. All directors serving on the Board during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of the meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served (in each case during the period in which he or she served).
Independence of the Board 
As required under the NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards, a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors must qualify as "independent," as affirmatively determined by the board of directors. After review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and us, our senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm, our Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Anchin, Ms. Clague, General Coburn, Mr. McCollum, and Mr. Osgood are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable NASDAQ listing standards.
Board Leadership Structure
Richard S. Danforth currently serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as a director. General John G. Coburn currently serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and the Board believes that it should maintain flexibility to select our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and board leadership structure from time to time. The Board believes that it is currently in our best interest, and that of our stockholders, for Mr. Danforth to serve as Chief Executive Officer and General Coburn to serve as Chairman. The Board believes that separating these positions allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus on day-to-day business operations, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board of Directors in its primary role of review and oversight of management.
Role of Board in Risk Oversight
Our management is primarily responsible to manage risk and inform the Board regarding our most material risks. The Board has oversight responsibility of the processes established to monitor and manage such risks. The Board believes that such oversight function is the responsibility of the entire Board through frequent reports and discussions at regularly scheduled Board meetings. In addition, the Board has delegated specific risk management oversight responsibility to the Audit Committee and to the independent members of the Board. In particular, the Audit Committee oversees management of risks related to accounting, auditing and financial reporting and maintaining effective internal controls for financial reporting. The Compensation Committee oversees risk management related to our executive compensation plans and arrangements. The independent directors on the Board oversee risk management related to the nomination of director candidates and our corporate governance practices. The Board believes that the leadership structure described above under "Board Leadership Structure" facilitates the Board's oversight of risk management because it allows the Board, working through its committees to participate actively in the oversight of management's actions. These specific risk categories and our risk management practices are regularly reviewed by the entire Board in the ordinary course of regular Board meetings.
Executive Sessions 
As required under NASDAQ listing standards, during the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, our independent directors met at least twice in regularly scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors were present.
Stockholder Communications with the Board
We have adopted a formal process by which stockholders may communicate with our Board. The Board recommends that stockholders initiate any communications with the Board in writing and send them in care of Investor Relations by mail to our principal offices, 16262 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, CA 92127. This centralized process will assist the Board in reviewing and responding to stockholder communications in an appropriate manner. The name of any specific intended Board recipient should be noted in the communication. The Board has instructed Investor Relations to forward such correspondence only to the intended recipients; however, the Board has also instructed Investor Relations, prior to forwarding any correspondence, to review such correspondence and, in its discretion, not to forward certain items if they are deemed of a personal, illegal, commercial, offensive or frivolous nature or otherwise inappropriate for the Board's consideration. In such cases, that correspondence will be forwarded to our corporate Secretary for review and possible response. This information is also contained on our website at www.lradx.com.
Information Regarding the Board Committees 
During the full fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board had three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The current charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee can be found on our website at www.lradx.com.

Director Nominations
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes recommendations to the full Board for nominations to fill vacancies on the Board and for selecting the management nominees for the directors to be elected by our stockholders at each annual meeting.
Director Qualifications
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that new candidates for director should have certain minimum qualifications, including having the knowledge, capabilities, experience and contacts that complement those currently existing within our company; ability and qualifications to provide our management with an expanded opportunity to explore ideas, concepts and creative approaches to existing and future issues, and to guide management through the challenges and complexities of building a quality company; ability to meet contemporary public company board standards with respect to general governance; stewardship, depth of review, independence, financial certification, personal integrity and responsibility to stockholders; genuine desire and availability to participate actively in the development of our future; and an orientation toward maximizing stockholder value in realistic time frames. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also intends to consider for new Board members such factors as ability to contribute strategically through relevant industry background and experience, on either the vendor or the end user side; strong current industry contacts; ability and willingness to introduce and open doors to executives of potential customers and partners; current employment as the Chief Executive Officer of an acoustic products, media, advertising, military or government supply company larger than our company; independence from our company and current Board members; and a recognizable name that would add credibility and value to our company and its stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy regarding diversity, but as described above considers a broad range of attributes and characteristics in identifying and evaluating nominees for election to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint in addition to more traditional diversity concepts. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may modify these qualifications from time to time.
Evaluating Nominees for Director 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews candidates for director nominees in the context of the current composition of our Board, our operating requirements and the long-term interests of stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently considers, among other factors, diversity, age, skills, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the Board and our company, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. In the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews such directors' overall service to our company during their term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance, and any other relationships and transactions that might impair such directors' independence. In the case of new director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee must be independent, which determination is based upon applicable NASDAQ listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice of counsel, if necessary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then uses its network of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the background and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of our Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider such candidates' qualifications and then selects a nominee for recommendation to our Board by majority vote. To date, neither the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nor any predecessor to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has paid a fee to any third party to assist in the process of identifying or evaluating director candidates.
Stockholder Nominations 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee applies the same guidelines (described above) to stockholder nominees as applied to nominees from other sources. Any stockholder who wishes to recommend for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Director's consideration a prospective nominee to serve on the Board may do so by giving the candidate's name and qualifications in writing to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at the following address: 16262 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, California 92127.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics," a code of ethics that applies to all employees, including our executive officers. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our Internet site at www.lradx.com. In the event we make any amendments to, or grant any waivers of, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or principal accounting officer that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules, we intend to disclose such amendment or waiver and the reasons therefor on a Form 8-K or on our next periodic report.
PROPOSAL TWORATIFICATION OF SELECTION OFINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected Squar Milner LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. A representative of Squar Milner LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. If present, the representative will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. Stockholder ratification of the selection of Squar Milner LLP is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, we are submitting the selection of Squar Milner LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will consider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of our company and our stockholders.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting, either in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the selection of Squar Milner LLP. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to the stockholders for the purpose of determining a quorum and will have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes are counted towards a quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether this matter has been approved.

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
All audit and non-audit services are pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the registered public accounting firm's independence. The Audit Committee pre-approves the annual engagement of the principal independent registered public accounting firm, including the performance of the annual audit and quarterly reviews for the subsequent fiscal year, and pre-approves specific engagements for tax services performed by such firm. The Audit Committee has also established pre-approval policies and procedures for certain enumerated audit and audit related services performed pursuant to the annual engagement agreement, including such firm's attendance at and participation at Board and committee meetings; services of such firm associated with SEC registration statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other documents issued in connection with securities offerings, such as comfort letters and consents; such firm's assistance in responding to any SEC comment letters; and consultations with such firm as to the accounting or disclosure treatment of transactions or events and/or the actual or potential impact of final or proposed rules, standards or interpretations by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, Financial Accounting Standards Board, or other regulatory or standard-setting bodies. The Audit Committee is informed of each service performed pursuant to its pre-approval policies and procedures.
The Audit Committee has considered the role of Squar Milner LLP in providing services to us for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and has concluded that such services are compatible with such firm's independence.
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote IN FAVOR of the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm.
PROPOSAL THREEADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Consistent with the vote of our stockholders, our Board of Directors has determined to submit the approval of our executive compensation annually to our stockholders on a non-binding basis. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. The vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers. Our executive compensation program received the support of stockholders holding 96.8% of our stock that was voted on the matter at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain a talented team of executives. We seek to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance that is aligned with our stockholders' long-term interests. We believe that our executive compensation program satisfies this goal and is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are including in this Proxy Statement a separate resolution, subject to a non-binding stockholder vote, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the following resolution is submitted for stockholder vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of LRAD Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed in the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation and the accompanying narrative disclosure in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting."
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis,  of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

Employment Arrangements 
We have entered into the following employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers reflected in the Summary Compensation Table.
Richard S. Danforth—Effective August 1, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Danforth, pursuant to which he was appointed Chief Executive Officer that provides for severance benefits including twelve months' salary and health benefits, a pro-rata share of his annual cash bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs to which he would have become entitled had he remained employed through the end of such fiscal year, and if his employment is terminated during fiscal year 2019 or later, vesting of a pro-rata share of the stock options held by him that are subject to performance-based vesting based on the extent to which the required performance criteria are achieved in the year of termination and on the portion of the year he was employed. The agreement also has a change of control clause whereby in the event of a specified termination event, the chief executive officer would be entitled to receive in a single lump sum (a) an amount equal to two times the sum of his base salary then in effect and his then target annual cash bonus, (b) a pro-rata share of his annual cash bonus for such year and (c) the cost of his and his dependents' coverage under COBRA for an 18-month period. In addition, in such event, (i) all of the time-vesting stock options held will vest, unless the termination occurs within the first year of his employment, in which case only the number of options scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of his employment date will vest pro-rated for the period of time he was employed during such one-year period, (ii) 375,000 of the stock options held that are subject to performance-based vesting will vest and (iii) if employment is terminated during fiscal year 2019 or later, a pro-rata share of the stock options held that are subject to performance-based vesting will vest based on the extent to which the required performance criteria are achieved for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs and based on the portion of the year he was employed prior to the termination.
Mr. Dennis D. Klahn—Effective September 18, 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Klahn pursuant to which he was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Under his employment agreement, Mr. Klahn's current annual salary is $206,000, and Mr. Klahn participates in bonus, benefit and other incentives at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Klahn's employment is not for a specified period or term of employment and is terminable at-will by us or by Mr. Klahn for any reason, with or without notice.
Executive Officer and Employee Incentive Plan 
On December 4, 2018, the Compensation Committee of our Board approved an incentive bonus plan for fiscal year 2019 designed to motivate our executive officers and key employees to achieve our financial objectives and to reward them for their achievements when our objectives are met. All of our named executive officers, as well as other key employees, will be entitled to participate in the incentive plan. Target bonus amounts vary based on a percentage of the employee's base salary, which are 75% of base salary for Mr. Danforth, 50% of base salary for Mr. Klahn and range from 25% to 50% of base salary for other employees depending on their level of responsibility. A bonus payment will be made at three levels, including at 50% of target, at 100% of target and at 200% of target, depending upon the achievement by our company of specified performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee established performance targets for Mr. Danforth and Mr. Klahn based on our total product bookings, net revenues, operating income and operating cash flow during fiscal year 2019.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of any class of our securities registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on a review of copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we believe that all persons subject to the reporting requirements pursuant to Section 16(a) filed the required reports on a timely basis with the SEC.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 there were no (and there are no currently proposed) transactions in which the amount involved exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of total assets at yearend for the last two completed fiscal years to which we were (or are to be) a participant and in which any executive officer, director, nominee for director, 5% beneficial owner of our common stock or member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had (or will have) a direct or indirect material interest.

The deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities and Exchange Commission is September 27, 2019.

If a stockholder wishes to have a stockholder proposal considered at our 2020 annual meeting, the stockholder must give timely notice of the proposal in writing to our Corporate Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice of the proposal must be delivered to, or mailed and received at our executive offices not earlier than December 13, 2019 and not later than January 12, 2020; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the scheduled date of this year's Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received no earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or, in the event we first make public announcement of the date of such annual meeting fewer than 70 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which we first make public announcement of the date of such meeting.

Other Matters Brought Before the Meeting
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
Proxy Solicitation
We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this Proxy Statement, the proxy and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners.

Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other regular employees of our company. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for such services.
Householding of Proxy Materials
In some cases, stockholders holding their shares in a brokerage or bank account who share the same surname and address and have not given contrary instructions received only one copy of the proxy materials. This practice is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save printing and postage costs. If you would like to have a separate copy of our annual report and/or proxy statement mailed to you or to receive separate copies of future mailings, please submit your request to the address or phone number that appears on your proxy card. We will deliver such additional copies promptly upon receipt of such request.
In other cases, stockholders receiving multiple copies at the same address may wish to receive only one. If you now receive more than one copy, and would like to receive only one copy, please submit your request to the address or phone number that appears on your proxy card.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may request and consent to electronic delivery of our future proxy materials and annual reports by following the instructions on your proxy card. If your shares are held in street name, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee and ask about the availability of electronic delivery. If you select electronic delivery, we will discontinue mailing the proxy materials and annual reports to you beginning next year and you will be sent an e-mail message notifying you of the Internet address or addresses where you may access the proxy materials and annual report. Your consent to electronic delivery will remain in effect until you revoke it. If you selected electronic delivery last year, we will not mail the materials to you this year and you will receive an e-mail message with the Internet address where you may access the proxy materials and annual report for the current year.
Additional Documentation
A copy of our Annual Report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 has been made available on-line or will be mailed upon request by our proxy service.
