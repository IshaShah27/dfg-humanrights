This proxy statement summarizes information that is intended to assist you in making an informed vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting?
Only stockholders of record, as of the record date, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The record date to determine stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting is the close of business on March 25, 2019.

How many shares must be present to conduct the Annual Meeting?
We must have a quorum present in person or by proxy to conduct the Annual Meeting. A quorum is established when a majority of shares entitled to vote is present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.

The agenda for the Annual Meeting is to:

 1.   elect seven directors;  
 2.   ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019;

How do I vote at the Annual Meeting?
You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. There are three ways to vote by proxy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● By Telephone – You can vote by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card. You will need to use the control number appearing on your Notice or proxy card to vote by telephone;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● By Internet – You can vote via the Internet by following the instructions on your proxy card. You will need to use the control number appearing on your Notice or proxy card to vote via the internet; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● By Mail – You can vote by completing, dating, signing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.  
[END TABLE]
Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day. You may vote over the telephone or via the Internet until 10:59 p.m. (Central Time) on May 22, 2019. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting in person.
Your proxy will be voted in accordance with your instructions, so long as, in the case of a proxy card returned by mail, such card has been signed and dated. If you vote your shares via the Internet, by telephone or by executing and returning a proxy card by mail but you do not provide specific instructions with respect to the proposals, your shares will be voted FOR the director nominees named in this proxy statement, FOR the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and FOR the advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement.
As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not know of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting except those described in this proxy statement. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will be authorized to vote or otherwise act in accordance with their judgment.
What should I do if I receive more than one set of proxy materials from the Company?
If you hold your shares in multiple accounts or registrations, or in both registered and street name, you may receive proxy materials for each account. Please vote by telephone or via the Internet for each Notice and set of proxy materials that you receive, or vote by mail by signing, dating and returning all proxy cards you receive from the Company. Only the latest dated proxy that you submit for each account will be voted and counted.
May I change my vote?
Yes. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. To change your vote, if you are a stockholder of record, you may submit another later dated proxy by telephone, Internet or mail or by voting your shares in person at the Annual Meeting (your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; you must vote in person at the Annual Meeting to revoke your proxy). If you are a beneficial owner and your shares are held in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker, trustee or nominee, or if you have obtained a legal proxy from such entity giving you the right to vote your shares, you may change your vote by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.
What vote is required to elect directors and approve the other matters described in this proxy statement?
Consistent with good governance policies, the Company's amended and restated bylaws ("Bylaws") provide for majority voting in uncontested elections. Because this is an uncontested election, the director nominees must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast to be elected (i.e., the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee) (Proposal No. 1). Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors.
For the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 2) and the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (Proposal No. 3), the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval. Abstentions will not be voted but will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. Accordingly, abstentions will have the effect of a negative vote on Proposals No. 2 and 3. Broker non-votes will have no effect on Proposal No. 3.

What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered in your name on the Company's books and records or with our transfer agent, you are the "stockholder of record" of those shares, and this proxy statement and accompanying materials have been provided directly to you by the Company. On the other hand, if you purchased your shares through a brokerage or other financial intermediary, the brokerage or other financial intermediary will automatically put your shares into "street name" which means that the brokerage or other financial intermediary will hold your shares in its name or another nominee's name and not in your name, but will keep records showing you as the "beneficial owner." If you hold shares beneficially in street name, this proxy statement and accompanying materials have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record.
How do I vote if my bank or broker holds my shares in "street name"?
If you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, such bank, broker or nominee will vote those shares in accordance with your instructions. To so instruct your bank, broker or nominee, you should refer to the information provided to you by such entity. Without instructions from you, a bank, broker or nominee will be permitted to exercise its own voting discretion with respect to so-called routine matters but will not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters. The only routine matter on our agenda for the Annual Meeting is Proposal No. 2 (ratification of auditors). Proposals No. 1 (director elections) and 3 (advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers) are each non-routine matters. Thus, if you do not give your bank, broker or nominee specific instructions with respect to Proposal No. 2, your shares will be voted in such entity's discretion. If you do not give your bank, broker or nominee specific instructions with respect to the remaining proposals, your shares will not be voted on such proposals. This is called a "broker non-vote." Shares represented by such broker non-votes will be counted in determining whether there is a quorum and will have the effect described above on each of the non-routine proposals. We urge you to provide your bank, broker or nominee with appropriate voting instructions so that all your shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting.
How many votes do I have?
Each share of common stock that you hold as of the record date entitles you to one vote, without cumulation, on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting.
How will the votes be counted at the Annual Meeting?
The votes will be counted by the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting.
How will the Company announce the voting results?
The Company will report the final results of the voting at the Annual Meeting in a filing with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Who pays for the Company's solicitation of proxies?
The Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares of common stock at our Annual Meeting. We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies on behalf of the Company, including preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement. Proxies may be solicited personally, by mail, email or by telephone by certain of our directors, officers, employees or representatives. Our directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We will reimburse brokerage houses, banks, custodians, and other nominees and fiduciaries for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding our proxy solicitation materials.
What is "householding" and how does it work?
Under the rules adopted by the SEC, we may deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is referred to as "householding" and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have delivered only one set of proxy materials to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We agree to deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy materials, as requested, to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of these documents was delivered. If you prefer to receive separate copies of the proxy statement or annual report, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by calling 1-866-540-7095 or in writing at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, Attention: Householding Department.

[END TABLE]
In addition, if you currently are a stockholder who shares an address with another stockholder and would like to receive only one copy of future notices and proxy materials for your household, you may notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or you may notify us if you hold registered shares. Registered stockholders may notify us by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at the above telephone number or address.
What do I need for admission to the Annual Meeting?
Attendance at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof will be limited to record and beneficial stockholders as of the record date (March 25, 2019), individuals holding a valid proxy from a record holder, and other persons authorized by the Company. If you are a stockholder of record, your name will be verified against the list of stockholders of record prior to your admittance to the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. You should be prepared to present photo identification for admission. If you hold your shares in a street name, you will need to provide proof of beneficial ownership on the record date, such as a brokerage account statement showing that you owned stock as of the record date, a copy of a voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership as of the record date, as well as your photo identification, for admission. If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures described above, you will not be admitted to the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. For security reasons, you and your bags may be subject to search prior to your admittance to the Annual Meeting.

Criteria for Selection of Directors
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, screening and recommending to the entire Board candidates for Board membership. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the qualifications and independence of the members of the Board and its various committees on a periodic basis as well as the Board's composition as a whole. This assessment will include members' independence, as well as consideration of diversity, age, skills and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. The following are general criteria that the Nominating and Governance Committee could use in evaluating candidates for Board membership. None of the following should be construed as minimum qualifications for director selection:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● background, experiences and record of achievement, including, without limitation, in the manufacturing and raw materials industries;

The Nominating and Governance Committee will review with the Board, on a periodic basis, the skills and characteristics required of the Board members in the context of the current director candidates in accordance with its charter. The Board itself will be ultimately responsible for selecting its own members and nominating them for election by stockholders.

Recommendation of Directors by Stockholders
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider candidates for election as a director of the Company recommended by any stockholder, provided that the recommending stockholder follows the procedures set forth in Section 3.3 of the Bylaws for nominations by stockholders of persons to serve as directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee would evaluate such candidates in the same manner by which it evaluates other director candidates considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee, as described above.
Pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Bylaws, all nominations of stockholder nominees must be made by timely written notice given by a stockholder of record of the Company. To be timely, the notice must be delivered personally or mailed to and received at the Company's office, addressed to the attention of the Corporate Secretary. In the case of the nomination at an annual meeting of stockholders, no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if the annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days earlier or 60 days later than the first anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders, no annual meeting was held during the prior year, the notice by the stockholder must be received no earlier than 120 days before such annual meeting and no later than the later of 90 days before such annual meeting or the tenth day after the day on which the notice of such annual meeting was made by mail or was otherwise publicly disclosed.

The stockholder's notice or recommendation is required to contain certain prescribed information about each person whom the stockholder proposes to recommend for election as a director, the stockholder giving notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf notice is given. The stockholder's notice must also include the consent of the person proposed to be nominated and to serve as a director if elected. Recommendations or notices relating to director nominations should be sent to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., 475 N. Martingale Road Suite 1050, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173; Attention: Anne-Marie W. D'Angelo, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.
A copy of our Bylaws has been filed as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed on March 10, 2015.
Independence of Directors
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). The NYSE rules require that a majority of the members of our Board and each of the members of our Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees be independent. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have satisfied such NYSE requirements.
The Board has determined that Ms. Avril and Messrs. Marsh, Ray, Walker, Welch and Whitaker are "independent directors" as such term is defined by the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE. Mr. Wasz does not qualify as an independent director, for purposes of the NYSE, because he is our current Chief Executive Officer and President.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board has an oversight role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of our risks. Our Board focuses on our general risk management strategy, the most significant risks facing us, and oversees the implementation of risk mitigation strategies by management. The Board regularly reviews information regarding our credit, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our employee compensation plans, policies and programs, as well as our annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in each proxy statement and the Audit Committee of the Board oversees the management of financial risks. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to corporate governance matters. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
Environmental and Social Matters
The Company is firmly committed to working safely, protecting health and safeguarding the environment. Corporate citizenship is an integral part of our corporate culture and is reflected in the way we conduct business. We believe that outstanding performance in these areas directly contributes to the success of our Company.
Health and Safety
We strive to achieve a 'Best in Class' performance status for employee safety. Our corporate values, policies (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics) and procedures are aligned to promote care and concern for others, keeping ourselves and others safe and healthy. Our employees are provided with the knowledge, skills and abilities to work safely and maintain a healthy environment through our annual Safety Excellence Conference. Additionally, a number of our locations participate in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") sponsored Voluntary Protection Program, or VPP. The Safety Excellence and VPP initiatives evidence our proactive approach, which stresses strong employee participation and collaboration, management accountability, employee training and hazard elimination as core foundational elements. In 2018, our A.J. Oster facilities in Alliance, Ohio and Carol Stream, Illinois were recognized as VPP Star sites. In 2016, our A.J. Oster facility in Yorba Linda, California was recognized as a VPP Star site. This recognition reflects the facilities' achievement in the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management system resulting in injury and illness rates that are below the national averages for the industry. We also promote mutual respect for the diverse backgrounds, talents and capabilities of our workforce.

Environment
We are sensitive to the environmental, health and safety consequences of our operations. Accordingly, we strive to maintain compliance with all applicable Federal and State environmental laws and regulations, including, among others, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Our long-standing commitment to good environmental stewardship is evidenced by the initiatives and programs we have developed and maintained and awards we have received. For three years in a row, Olin Brass has been awarded the "Energy Star Partner of the Year" award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The purpose of the award is to honor businesses and organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protecting the environment through superior energy efficiency achievements.  In the area of heavy industrial manufacturing, Olin Brass is the only producer of non-ferrous strip products to receive such a designation. Our internal reporting programs are designed to monitor, evaluate and improve environmental, health and safety performance. Our initiatives include projects focused on recycling and waste reduction. As an industrial manufacturing company, we are fortunate that our primary base materials are brass and copper. Brass and copper are sustainable materials that are fully and infinitely recyclable, and the majority of the end products we manufacture continue to come from previously recycled material.
Corporate Responsibility
We are a responsible corporate citizen with our employees, customers, business partners and communities. The Company is committed to programs that ensure health and safety of our employees, protection of the environment and enrichment of our communities.
In addition to ongoing programs embedded within our enterprise risk management programs, additional areas of focus, including environmental, social and governance matters, are reviewed by management with the Board annually. The Board has assigned responsibility to oversee sustainability issues, including as it pertains to environmental and corporate social responsibility matters, to the Nominating and Governance Committee.
Corporate Governance
The Board has approved Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Conduct and Ethics. All of our corporate governance documents, including the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and committee charters, are available on our website at www.gbcholdings.com or in printed form upon request by contacting Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. at 475 N. Martingale Road Suite 1050, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173, Attention: Investor Relations. The Board regularly reviews corporate governance developments and will modify these documents as warranted. Any modifications will be reflected on our website. The information on our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not deemed to be incorporated by reference herein.
Other Board Information
Leadership Structure of the Board
The Board has determined that the appropriate leadership structure for the Board at this time is for Mr. Walker, our former Chief Executive Officer, to serve as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Walker possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities, and challenges facing the Company and its businesses and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board's time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. We believe that this structure is appropriate for the Company because it allows our Chairman to lead the Board in its fundamental role of managing the Company and providing advice to management, while also providing for effective oversight by a majority of independent directors and allowing our Chief Executive Officer and President to focus on the execution of our business strategy, growth and development.
We do not have a formal policy that requires the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be separate, and the Board, in its discretion, may decide to change the leadership structure. Currently, the Chairman of our Board is our former Chief Executive Officer and the Board has determined that a lead independent director is not necessary at this time.
Lead Independent Director
In the future, the Company may choose to appoint a lead independent director to coordinate the activities of the other non-management directors, and to perform such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may from time to time determine. Through February 2017, Ronald C. Whitaker served as our lead independent director, and after such time, the role of the lead independent director concluded with the determination that Mr. Walker, the Chairman of the Board, was independent.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 11  GLOBAL BRASS AND COPPER HOLDINGS, INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement   
[END TABLE]
While serving as lead independent director, Mr. Whitaker has followed governance practices established by the Board that support effective communication and effective Board performance.
Board Meetings
In 2018, our Board held twelve meetings. In addition to our Board meetings, our directors attend meetings of committees established by our Board. Each of our director nominees attended at least 75% of the meetings of our Board and the committees on which he or she served during 2018 that were held when he or she was a director. Our directors are encouraged to attend all annual and special meetings of our stockholders. In 2018, all seven directors attended the annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Walker presides over non-management sessions.
Committees of the Board
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee. The following chart sets forth the directors who currently serve as members of each of the Board committees.

Audit Committee
In 2018, the Audit Committee held eight meetings. Each of the members of the Audit Committee is a non-employee director. In addition, the Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE and under Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and that all such members are financially literate. The Board also has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are audit committee financial experts, as defined in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and have accounting or related financial management expertise. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines limit the number of public company audit committees on which an Audit Committee member can serve to three or fewer audit committees (including the Company's Audit Committee) without approval of the Board. None of our Audit Committee members serve on more than three public company audit committees (including the Company's Audit Committee).
The principal duties and responsibilities of our audit committee are to prepare the report required by the rules of the SEC to be included in our annual proxy statement or annual report and oversee and monitor the following:

Compensation Committee
In 2018, the Compensation Committee held six meetings. Each of the current members of the Compensation Committee is a non-employee director. In addition, the Board has determined that all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent as defined (i) in the listing standards of the NYSE, including the specific independence requirements for compensation committee members and (ii) the Company's corporate governance guidelines. Additionally, the Board has determined that all of the members of the Compensation Committee are outside directors for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The principal duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● developing, reviewing, evaluating and monitoring our overall compensation policies, including, without limitation, determining the appropriate balance among base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards, and establishing performance based incentives that support and reinforce (i) our objectives and performance goals and (ii) the long-term interests of our stockholders;

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has engaged Willis Towers Watson ("WTW") as its independent compensation consultant. WTW reports directly to the Compensation Committee and assists in the review and design of our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and confirmed the independence of WTW and concluded that their work for the Compensation Committee does not raise any conflict of interest.
The Compensation Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees, including committees whose members are not members of the Board, as it deems appropriate.
No subject employee should attend that portion of any meeting where the subject employee's performance or compensation is discussed, unless specifically invited by the Compensation Committee. Meetings to determine the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer must be held in executive session. Meetings to determine the compensation of subject employees other than our Chief Executive Officer may be attended by our Chief Executive Officer, but our Chief Executive Officer may not vote on these matters.

Stockholder Engagement and Communications to the Board
Our Board values the feedback and insights gained from frequent engagement with our stockholders. In 2018, in addition to interactions regarding our financial performance, we engaged with stockholders representing a significant portion of our outstanding shares on matters relating to our long-term business strategy and performance, corporate governance, executive compensation and corporate responsibility. Our engagement takes different forms, such as investor road shows, investor presentations and reports posted on our website and frequent informal conversations between investors and our Chief Financial Officer. We are committed to including our stockholders' perspectives in boardroom discussions, and we believe that regular engagement with our stockholders is necessary in order to ensure thoughtful and informed consideration of those matters.
Stockholders and interested parties can contact the Board or our non-employee directors through written communication sent to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., 475 N. Martingale Road Suite 1050, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173, Attention: Anne-Marie W. D'Angelo, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Our General Counsel reviews all written communications and forwards to the Board or our non-employee directors, as applicable, a summary and/or copies of any such correspondence that is directed to the Board or our non-employee directors, as applicable, or that, in the opinion of the General Counsel, deals with the functions of the Board, Board committees or our non-employee directors, as applicable, or that she otherwise determines require their attention. Concerns relating to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of our internal audit department and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters.

Communications of a confidential nature can be made directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee regarding any accounting, internal accounting control or auditing matter, by submitting such concerns to the Audit Committee. Any submissions to the Audit Committee should be marked confidential and addressed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, c/o Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc., 475 N. Martingale Road Suite 1050, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173. Any submission should contain, to the extent possible, a full and complete description of the matter, the parties involved, and the date of the occurrence or, if the matter is ongoing, the date the matter was initiated and any other information that the reporting party believes would assist the Audit Committee in the investigation of such matter.
Succession Planning
Our Board maintains a detailed succession plan for the CEO and other key officers, which the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews at least once each year.
Director Compensation
The objectives for our non-employee director compensation program are to attract highly-qualified individuals to serve on our Board and align their interests with those of our stockholders. Our Compensation Committee reviews our director compensation program annually to confirm that the program remains appropriate and competitive, and recommends any changes to our full Board for consideration and approval. During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged WTW, our independent compensation consultant, to review our compensation for non-employee directors and to make recommendations with regard to director compensation matters. Pursuant to this engagement, WTW found that our 2018 director compensation (described below) approximates the median of the Company's peer group. As such, no adjustments were made to the director compensation program in 2018.
The following table shows the director fees earned by our non-employee directors for 2018. In addition, we reimbursed the directors for reasonable expenses incurred in attending Board meetings.

Currently, our non-employee directors are eligible for an annual cash retainer of $75,000 and an annual equity award of $105,000. The chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $20,000. The chair of the Compensation Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000 and the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee receives an additional $10,000 cash retainer.
At our May 26, 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"). Pursuant to this amendment and restatement, the Omnibus Plan provides that a non-employee director may not receive in any calendar year stock awards under the Omnibus Plan with an aggregate grant date fair market value greater than $300,000, whether or not such awards are settled in cash or in stock. This limit does not apply to any equity awards under the Omnibus Plan that a non-employee director elects to receive at fair market value in lieu of all or a portion of such non-employee director's cash retainer.
Guidelines on Share Ownership at Global Brass and Copper Holdings
We maintain stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors because we believe it is vital to align our stockholders' interests with those of our board and senior leadership. These guidelines provide a targeted ownership level of shares of common stock for each non-employee director equal to four times the annual cash retainer amount. As of December 31, 2018, each of our non-employee directors is in compliance with these guidelines.

 2018 PROGRAM  UPDATES   Long-Term Incentive Compensation● In 2018, the Compensation Committee changed the mix of long-term equity awards for named executive officers from 50% performance shares, 25% stock options and 25% restricted stock to a combination of performance shares and restricted stock as follows: –     60% performance shares, subject to a two-year performance period. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the amount of performance shares earned based on achievement of certain levels of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). At that time, 50% of the performance shares earned will vest and be distributed immediately, and the other 50% earned will vest and be distributed one year after the performance determination, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with the Company. The delayed distribution (and continued vesting) of 50% of each performance share award further enhances their retention value and long-term alignment with stockholders' interests. –     40% restricted stock, which will vest in three equal installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with the Company.

 2019 PROGRAM  UPDATES   Based on approval of our executive compensation programs in our most recent advisory "say-on-pay" stockholder vote by approximately 94% of the votes cast, the Company is not making any substantial changes to our executive compensation program for 2019. For LTI awards, we modified the performance matrix for the 2019 performance shares to reflect 2019 budget and 2020 strategic projections and we adopted a new ROIC definition to include stock compensation costs. The performance share awards are to be earned based on a combination of return on invested capital (a percentage) at the end of 2020, accumulated ROIC dollars (a dollar amount) for 2019 and 2020 and stock price. Finally, we decided to terminate and distribute the executive life insurance policies we had maintained on certain executives in 2019.

Chief Executive Officer Pay at-a-Glance
The target total direct compensation for Mr. Wasz in 2018 (base salary, annual cash bonus and long-term stock awards) was determined by the Compensation Committee in the spring of 2018. The Compensation Committee overall looks to target Mr. Wasz's total direct compensation within a competitive range of the median of its peer group.
A significant portion of Mr. Wasz's total direct compensation is "at-risk," including his cash bonus, performance shares and restricted stock. We believe that the long-term stock awards create a direct link between his future compensation and the value he helps create for our stockholders. To the extent target performance measures are not achieved, or they are exceeded, Mr. Wasz's resulting compensation will be below or above the target total direct compensation, supporting our pay-for-performance philosophy.

The following table breaks down in further detail the components of Mr. Wasz's 2018 total compensation outside of his base salary. To see the business performance targets in greater detail, see page 27.

Aligning Pay with Performance
Pay for performance is one of the guiding principles of our executive compensation program, and our Compensation Committee ensures that the philosophy is carried out in all aspects of our executive compensation package.
Beyond base pay, we provide both short- and long-term incentives to our executives to encourage the effective management of major functions, teamwork, strategy development and execution, and oversight of key initiatives, all of which contribute to our Company's performance and stockholder value. That is why the majority of our named executive officer's compensation is "at-risk" and tied to the overall performance of Global Brass and Copper Holdings and its stock price. As an executive increases his/her scope of responsibilities, a greater portion of compensation becomes performance-based and at-risk, further emphasizing the connection between pay and performance.
We intentionally establish challenging performance targets for each executive, based on a combination of financial metrics and individual goals, and our performance compared to our peers. For 2018, our compensation program was designed based on the following objectives and metrics:

Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee determines the appropriate level of compensation for all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 STEP 1     STEP 2     STEP 3  
 The Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President of Human Resources present to the Compensation Committee their annual recommendations for pay and incentives for all executives. However, the chief executive officer does not make a recommendation regarding his own pay.      The Compensation Committee sets the annual pay and target incentive compensation for each named executive officer. When setting the target compensation for the year, the Compensation Committee considers data from the Company's peer group as well as broader industry studies and recommendations from its independent executive compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson.    At the completion of the year, the Compensation Committee confirms achievement of prior-year performance metrics and approves current fiscal year compensation within the first 45 days of the fiscal year. Short- and long-term incentive targets for the new fiscal year, as well as short-term incentive payouts and long-term incentive performance achievement, if applicable, are awarded after approval by the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Independent Executive Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee engages WTW as an independent executive compensation consultant. WTW provides consulting advice regarding executive compensation, as well as data from the Willis Towers Watson Compensation Data Base and public sources such as proxy filings. These resources ensure that we maintain competitive compensation practices compared to our peers. During 2018, the Company paid WTW $184,836 for its executive compensation consulting.
During 2018, the Company also paid WTW $4,866 for open enrollment consulting, which was not related to executive compensation. WTW annually prepares an executive compensation consultant independence letter, which specifies six factors that compensation committees must consider in selecting and monitoring the independence of their advisors and confirming that they are independent with no conflicts of interest.
Peer Group Used for Comparison
[BEGIN TABLE]
     In 2018, our independent compensation consultant benchmarked the compensation for our named executive officers against a peer group of 16 companies. The peer group is also used to review annual and long-term incentive plan practices, independent director compensation, and other related analyses.   The 2018 peer group included the following companies, which were selected because they are in the industrial machinery or similar industries, are of a similar size, and have similar product offerings and end markets as Global Brass and Copper Holdings

Stockholder Engagement and Input on Executive Compensation
As discussed in the letter from our CEO at the beginning of this proxy statement, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders regarding compensation and other issues. Our engagement takes different forms, such as investor road shows, investor presentations and reports posted on our website and frequent informal conversations between investors and our Chief Financial Officer.
A key component of stockholder input on the design of our executive compensation programs and the specific compensation decisions for each of our named executive officers is the advisory "say-on-pay" vote at our annual meeting. In 2018, approximately 94% of the votes cast in our "say-on-pay" stockholder vote approved the compensation for our named executive officers. Based on this approval, the Company is not making any significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2019.

Analysis of 2018 Compensation
Base Salary
Base salaries for the named executive officers reflect the experience, skill level and responsibility of the individuals. The Compensation Committee determines the base salary, and any increases, for executive officers using external surveys of salary practices for positions with similar levels of responsibility at our peer group companies and taking into account the performance of the individual and the Company.
The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries for our named executive officers annually but does not uniformly raise base salaries each year. Base salary increases for 2018 ranged from 3.0% (consistent with the Company's overall merit budget) to 8.1%, with the higher increases made to better align these named executive officers' salaries with the median percentile of our peer group.

Our long-term incentive program directly connects executive compensation to Company performance — rewarding performance over the long term, serving as a retention tool and aligning our executives' interests with stockholders' interests. The equity grants our Compensation Committee made in 2018 are structured to drive achievement of our business strategy while ensuring sharp focus on critical results.
In 2018, the mix of long-term equity awards for named executive officers was a combination of performance shares and restricted stock as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 60% performance shares, subject to a two-year performance period. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the amount of performance shares earned based on achievement of certain levels of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), accumulated ROIC dollars, stock price and other factors. At that time, 50% of the performance shares earned will vest and be distributed immediately, and the other 50% earned will vest and be distributed one year after the performance determination, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 28  GLOBAL BRASS AND COPPER HOLDINGS, INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement

[BEGIN TABLE]
● 40% restricted stock, which will vest in three equal installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
All named executive officers received a long-term equity grant for 2018. The amount awarded to each individual was based on the individual's experience and impact on the business, competitive considerations, retention risk, and input from our independent compensation consultant, which benchmarked our equity practices to ensure that we remain competitive with our peer companies. The total long-term incentive opportunity for each named executive officer is expressed as a percentage of his base salary.
2018 Performance Shares
Performance shares awarded in 2018 are eligible to vest at the end of a two-year performance period (January 2018 – December 2019) based on the achievement of certain levels of ROIC, accumulated ROIC dollars, stock price and other factors. If the performance metrics are reached or exceeded, half of the award will vest immediately and half will vest and be distributed after an additional year. To receive the award, named executive officers must be employed by the Company at vesting.
The ROIC performance targets were based on the two-year business plan and set by the Compensation Committee after a detailed review which included benchmarking performance and evaluating the practices of peer group companies. The shares vest if Global Brass and Copper Holdings achieves the target performance. Based on 100% achievement of target, participants will receive:

Guidelines on Share Ownership at Global Brass and Copper Holdings
We maintain stock ownership guidelines for members of senior management, including our named executive officers, who participate in our equity compensation programs because we believe it is vital to align our stockholders' interests with those of our senior leadership. These guidelines provide a targeted ownership level of shares of common stock for each named executive officer position equal to a multiple of his base salary.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER   Ownership Guidelines   Current Ownership Status  
     NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER   Ownership Guidelines   Current Ownership Status  
 John J. Wasz   4 times base salary   Meets requirement  
 Christopher J. Kodosky   2 times base salary   Meets requirement  
 Devin K. Denner   2 times base salary   Meets requirement  
 Dale R. Taylor   2 times base salary   Meets requirement  
 William G. Toler   2 times base salary   Meets requirement  
[END TABLE]
Named executive officers are expected to retain a minimum of 75% of all shares (net of payment of option exercise prices, taxes and transaction costs) acquired pursuant to an award under the Omnibus Plan. The guidelines provide that once an executive achieves compliance, such executive will remain in compliance with the guidelines provided that he or she continues to hold or beneficially own the same or a greater number of eligible shares and/or units that were sufficient at that time to meet the targeted ownership level.
Risk Considerations in Our Compensation Program
On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee reviews, along with our independent compensation consultant, the Audit Committee, our Chief Financial Officer and our senior risk officers, our employee compensation programs as they relate to risk management and risk-taking incentives in order to determine whether any risk arising from such compensation programs is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We do not believe that our compensation policies and practices give rise to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
Our incentive compensation programs generally reward a mix of different performance measures, some of which are the financial performance measures. Additionally, our long-term incentives directly connect compensation to our performance by featuring restricted stock and performance shares. We believe that this mix of performance criteria mitigates any incentive to seek to maximize short-term performance at the expense of long-term performance or to maximize performance under one measure to the detriment of performance under another measure.
Maximum payouts under our incentive plans are capped at 200% of target payouts. And, our incentive compensation programs are designed with payout curves that are relatively smooth and do not contain steep payout "cliffs" that might encourage short-term business decisions in order to meet a payout threshold. We believe that these limits mitigate excessive risk-taking because the maximum amount that can be earned in a single cycle is limited. The incentive compensation for executives in key business segments is determined by company-wide performance measures as well as segment performance, to mitigate any incentive to pursue strategies that might maximize the performance of a single operating segment to the detriment of us as a whole.
Our senior management is subject to our stock ownership guidelines, which we believe incentivize our senior management to consider our long-term interests and our stockholders' long-term interests. Additionally, these guidelines discourage excessive risk-taking that could negatively impact our stock price.
Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy
In December 2014, the Company adopted our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the "Recoupment Policy") to provide for recovery of incentive compensation, if any, in excess of what would have been paid to our executive officers or former executive officers in the event that the Company is required to restate its financial results. The Recoupment Policy applies to all incentive-based cash and equity compensation awards granted on or after the 2014 effective date ("Incentive Compensation") to any current or former executive officer of the Company (collectively, the "Covered Recipients"). In the event that the Company is required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under such securities laws where such accounting restatement was caused or substantially caused by the intentional misconduct of the Covered Recipient, the Company will recover from such Covered Recipient who received Incentive Compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, based on the erroneous data, the amount, if any, in excess of what would have been paid to the Covered Recipient under the accounting restatement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 30  GLOBAL BRASS AND COPPER HOLDINGS, INC. | 2019 Proxy Statement   
[END TABLE]
The Recoupment Policy is administered by the Compensation Committee, which has the sole discretion in making all determinations under the Policy. The Recoupment Policy will be interpreted and administered (and, as necessary, amended to be) consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any official guidance issued thereunder.
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy
Pursuant to the Company's securities trading policy, directors, executive officers and other employees are prohibited from pledging any shares of stock or engaging in any hedging transactions involving or referencing Company securities.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Deductibility of Executive Compensation
In general, Code Section 162(m) limits the amount that we may deduct from our Federal income taxes for remuneration paid to our "covered employees" (as defined by Section 162(m), generally, our current and former named executive officers) up to $1 million per covered employee per year. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 162(m) provided an exception from this deduction limitation for certain forms of "performance-based compensation" that includes the gain recognized by named executive officers upon the exercise of compensatory stock options and on the vesting of performance share awards. Due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the performance-based compensation exception no longer applies to taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the compensation meets certain transition relief for remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, commonly referred to as grandfathered amounts.
In the past, our Compensation Committee generally sought to structure performance-based compensation for our covered employees, and to undertake the required ministerial actions, in a manner that complies with Section 162(m) in order to provide for the deductibility of such compensation to the extent possible. Our Compensation Committee generally will continue to emphasize performance-based compensation, even though it may no longer be deductible. The Compensation Committee expects in the future to authorize compensation in excess of $1 million to named executive officers that will not be deductible under Section 162(m) when it believes doing so is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
Our Compensation Committee will endeavor to maintain the deductibility of grandfathered amounts going forward, except where it determines in its business judgment (as done from time to time in the past) that it is in our best interest to provide for compensation that may not be fully deductible. Because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the guidance issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief for grandfathered amounts, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exception from the Section 162(m) deduction limit in fact will satisfy the exception.
Taxation of "Parachute" Payments and Deferred Compensation
We do not maintain any arrangements that would provide any of our named executive officers any "gross-up" or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability thatsuch individual might owe as a result of the application of Sections 280G, 4999, or 409A of the Code. Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code provide that executive officers,certain highly compensated employees, directors who hold significant equity interests and certain other service providers may be subject to an excise tax if they receivepayments or benefits in connection with a change in control that exceeds certain prescribed limits, and that we, or a successor, may forfeit a deduction on the amountssubject to this additional tax. Section 409A of the Code also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or otherservice provider receives "deferred compensation" that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Employment Agreement with John J. Wasz
Mr. Wasz, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, is party to an employment agreement, dated as of May 8, 2014. Mr. Wasz's employment agreement provides him with severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment. Mr. Wasz's employment can be terminated at any time and for any reason. If Mr. Wasz's employment is terminated by us for "cause" (as defined below) then he is only entitled to receive any base salary that had been earned but not paid through the date of termination. If his employment is terminated due to his death or disability, he is entitled to (a) the base salary accrued through the date of termination, (b) pay for any vacation time earned but not taken, (c) any earned but unpaid bonus for the year prior to termination, and (d) any business expenses incurred by him but unreimbursed on the date of termination, provided that such expenses and required substantiation and documentation thereof are submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of termination and that such expenses are reimbursable under our policy (collectively, "Final Compensation").
Mr. Wasz's employment can be terminated by us without "cause" or by him for "good reason." Upon such a termination, he is entitled to receive: (a) two years of base salary, (b) his target annual bonus, (c) health, dental, and life insurance coverage for a period of one year.
"Cause" under Mr. Wasz's employment agreement generally means any of the following:

[BEGIN TABLE]
● dishonest, disloyal or illegal conduct or gross misconduct that materially and adversely affects his performance or our reputation or business (it being agreed that a petty offense or a violation of the motor vehicle code shall not constitute "cause").  
[END TABLE]
Prior to the determination that "cause" has occurred with respect to any of the grounds listed above other than a conviction of or plea of nolo contendere to a felony, Mr. Wasz will have a 30-day cure period to remedy such breach, unless, in the Board's discretion, the "cause" event is incapable of reasonably prompt cure or if the Board determines that its fiduciary duty requires such termination.
"Good reason" under Mr. Wasz's employment agreement generally means any of the following events occurring without his consent:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● our failure to continue Mr. Wasz in the position of President and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● our requiring that Mr. Wasz report to an individual or body other than the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a material reduction of Mr. Wasz's base salary, annual target bonus opportunity, benefits, and annual equity incentive awards in the aggregate, excluding any reduction in Mr. Wasz's annual equity incentive awards that (a) is applicable to all similarly situated executives or (b) is 10% or less and results from adjustments to the allocation of a fixed pool among similarly situated executives.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Wasz is required to provide written notice of any event claimed to constitute "good reason" within 30 days after the initial occurrence of such event and to provide us with an opportunity to cure the applicable circumstance within 30 days following such written notice. If we fail to cure such circumstance, Mr. Wasz's resignation for "good reason" must be tendered, if at all, within 60 days after our failure to cure.
Mr. Wasz is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for 24 months post-termination, which applies to the 24-month period following his resignation. In addition, he is subject to perpetual confidentiality covenants.
Severance Protection Agreement with Christopher J. Kodosky
Mr. Kodosky, our Chief Financial Officer, is party to a severance protection agreement, dated as of July 11, 2016. Mr. Kodosky's employment may be terminated by us at any time for any reason. If Mr. Kodosky's employment is terminated by us without "cause" or if he resigns for "good reason," he would be entitled to a severance payment in a cash lump sum, equal to (i) one year of base pay at the highest rate of base salary during the one-year period immediately prior to the termination and (ii) the higher of (x) the target annual bonus amount for the year preceding the termination and (y) the average annual bonus earned and paid over the three years immediately prior to his termination. Mr. Kodosky and his dependents will also be entitled to continued health and welfare participation for one year following such termination, unless he obtains coverage from a new employer and COBRA coverage at the end of such one-year period if he has not obtained new coverage.
Mr. Kodosky's severance protection agreement generally uses the same definitions of "cause" and "good reason" as Mr. Wasz's employment agreement, except that, (i) under Mr. Kodosky's severance protection agreement "good reason" includes any assignment of duties materially and adversely inconsistent with his position, any material reduction in his base salary, target annual cash bonus opportunity plan, benefits, and annual equity incentive awards in the aggregate, excluding any reduction in his annual equity incentive awards that (a) is applicable to all similarly situated executives or (b) is twenty percent (20%) or less and results from adjustments to the allocation of a fixed pool among similarly situated executives, any requirement that his principal place of employment is other than our principal executive office or there is a change in his principal place of employment that increases the distance between his residence as of the date of this Agreement to his principal place of employment by more than fifty (50) miles (ii) and Mr. Kodosky must give written notice of a claim for good reason within 60 days of its initial occurrence.
Mr. Kodosky is subject to a non-competition covenant that extends for 12 months following his termination of employment for any reason, a non-disparagement covenant, a non-solicitation covenant that extends for 24 months following any such termination and a confidentiality covenant extending for five years following any termination of the severance protection agreement.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for evaluating audit performance, appointing, compensating, retaining and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm and evaluating policies and procedures relating to internal accounting functions and controls. The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Ms. Avril and Messrs. Marsh, Ray, Welch and Whitaker, each a non-employee and independent director, and operates under a written charter.
The Audit Committee members are neither professional accountants nor auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent auditor, nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent auditor is "independent" under applicable rules. The Audit Committee serves a board-level oversight role in which it provides advice, counsel and direction to management and the auditors on the basis of the information it receives, discussions with management and the auditors and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business, financial and accounting matters. Our management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as well as the report of management and the opinion thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for the year ended December 31, 2018, regarding the Company's internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from the Company.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.
The information contained in this Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C, other than as set forth in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that the information contained in this Report be treated as soliciting material, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any past or future filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference in such filing.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PAY RATIO
As required by the SEC, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of our median employee's annual total compensation compared to the annual total compensation of Mr. Wasz, our Chief Executive Officer.
Identification of Median Employee
In accordance with Instruction 2 to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, to calculate our 2018 pay ratio, we elected to utilize the same median employee that we had identified in 2017, because during 2018 there was no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. The process that we used to determine our median employee in 2017 is summarized in the paragraph below.
We selected December 31, 2017 as the date on which to determine the median employee. As of that date, we had approximately 1,980 employees (1,899 in the United States and Puerto Rico and 81 outside of the United States). For purposes of identifying the median employee, we used 2017 taxable year-to-date compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure. To identify the median employee, we excluded 81 non-U.S. employees from the following jurisdictions: 33 from the Republic of China, 41 from Mexico and 7 from Singapore. After applying this exemption, we analyzed a total of 1,899 employees to determine the median employee.
In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee and our Chief Executive Officer, we calculated their compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required by the SEC. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine annual total compensation reported above in the Summary Compensation Table for our Chief Executive Officer. We believe that the pay ratio disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the applicable SEC disclosure rules.

FEES OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
In addition to retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to audit our consolidated financial statements for 2018, we retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as well as other accounting firms, to provide tax and other advisory services in 2018. We understand the need for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to maintain objectivity and independence in its audit of our consolidated financial statements.
In order to assure that the provision of audit and permitted non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, does not impair its independence, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, other than de minimis services that satisfy the requirements pertaining to de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit work performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Any pre-approval must also set forth in detail the particular service or category of services approved and is generally subject to a specific cost limit. All of the fees for audit, audit-related, tax and other services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policies and procedures described in this paragraph.
The Audit Committee has adopted policies regarding our ability to hire employees, former employees and certain relatives of employees of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
During 2018 and 2017, we retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide services in the following categories and amounts:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Tax fees (3)      —       —   
 All other fees (4)      2,700       —   
 Total    $ 2,691,200     $ 3,160,000   
[END TABLE]

 (2)   Audit-related fees consist of fees incurred for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees" and fees billed for professional services provided in connection with the new accounting pronouncements.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We maintain and enforce a Related Person Transaction Policy, which sets forth our policy with respect to the review, approval, ratification and disclosure of all related person transactions by our Audit Committee. In accordance with our Related Person Transaction Policy, our Audit Committee has overall responsibility for the implementation and compliance with this policy.
For the purposes of our Related Person Transaction Policy, a "related person transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we were, are or will be a participant and in which any related person (as defined in our Related Person Transaction Policy) had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest in excess of $120,000. A "related person transaction" does not include any employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer and any related compensation resulting solely from that employment relationship which has been reviewed and approved by the Board or Compensation Committee.
Our Related Person Transaction Policy requires that notice of a proposed related person transaction be provided to our legal department prior to entering into such transaction. If our legal department determines that such transaction is a related person transaction, the proposed transaction will be submitted to our Audit Committee for consideration at its next meeting. Under our Related Person Transaction Policy, our Audit Committee will only be permitted to approve those related person transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests. In the event we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been previously reviewed, approved or ratified under our Related Person Transaction Policy and that is ongoing or is completed, the transaction will be submitted to the Audit Committee so that it may determine whether to ratify, rescind or terminate the related person transaction.
Our Related Person Transaction Policy also provides that the Audit Committee will review certain previously approved or ratified related person transactions that are ongoing to determine whether the related person transaction remains in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.
In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits activities that conflict with, or have the appearance of conflicting with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such conflicts of interest may arise when an employee, or a member of the employee's family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of such individual's position in the Company.
Certain Transactions
There were no related party transactions in 2018.

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
(PROPOSAL NO. 2)
Our Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. A proposal will be presented at the Annual Meeting to ratify this appointment. Ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. If the stockholders fail to ratify such selection, another independent registered public accounting firm will be considered by our Audit Committee, but the Audit Committee may nonetheless choose to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Even if the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. We have been advised that a representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if such person chooses to do so, make a statement.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF
THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS
OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019.
PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE VOTED FOR THE PROPOSAL UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY A CONTRARY VOTE.
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT
(PROPOSAL NO. 3)
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking the advisory approval by stockholders of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. While this vote is advisory, and not binding on the Board, it will provide information to the Board and Compensation Committee regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation programs and practices, which the Compensation Committee will carefully review when evaluating our executive compensation program. In 2014, our stockholders approved a non-binding resolution to require an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every year, and accordingly, we have elected to provide this vote annually.
Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following advisory resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the 2019 proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures."
The Company is committed to maintaining executive compensation programs and practices that are aligned with the Company's business strategy.
We urge our stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section above, which describes in detail how our executive compensation program and practices operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the accompanying compensation tables, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted on the proposal at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of this advisory resolution.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE VOTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY A CONTRARY VOTE.
