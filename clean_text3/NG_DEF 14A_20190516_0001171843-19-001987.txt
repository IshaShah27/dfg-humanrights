SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Maintaining an active shareholder engagement program continues to be a high priority for the Company and is an integral part of our corporate governance practices. The Board Chair, CEO, and Vice President of Corporate Communications meet regularly with large shareholders, and the Company's Corporate Communications team is very responsive to shareholder inquiries regardless of ownership level.
In 2018, NOVAGOLD placed calls to or met in person with all its shareholders owning 50,000 shares or more; in other words, NOVAGOLD contacted or attempted to contact its owners holding approximately 88% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote at NOVAGOLD's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
In addition to NOVAGOLD's regular shareholder engagement program described above and building upon a similar effort conducted after the 2017 annual shareholder meeting (see page 83 below), after our May 2018 annual shareholder meeting we commenced a post-proxy season shareholder engagement campaign in response to the 77% approval rate for our advisory Say-on-Pay resolution. In August and September 2018, Company management invited the 10 largest shareholders whom the Company believed voted against the 2018 Say-on-Pay advisory resolution to discuss general executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Six shareholders representing approximately 14.65% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares replied and agreed to a telephonic meeting or sent a written response. We undertook this enhanced engagement campaign to ensure that any changes made to our executive compensation program or corporate governance practices incorporated feedback from our shareholders. We plan to continue to regularly engage with our shareholders.
A summary of the key feedback we received from shareholders during our 2017 and 2018 shareholder engagement campaigns and our response to that feedback is contained in the following table.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR
INFORMATION REGARDING ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF MEETING
Solicitation of Proxies
THIS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR (this "Circular") IS FURNISHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE "BOARD OF DIRECTORS" OR THE "BOARD") OF NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. ("NOVAGOLD" or the "Company") for use at the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders (the "Shareholders") of the Company to be held at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver in the Grouse Room, 655 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 2R7, Canada, on Thursday, May 16, 2019 at 1:00 p.m. (Pacific time) (the "Meeting") or at any adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Meeting. This Circular, the accompanying Notice of Meeting and the form of proxy were first made available to Shareholders on March 26, 2019.
Solicitation of proxies from registered Shareholders will primarily be by mail or courier, supplemented by telephone or other personal contact by employees or agents of the Company at nominal cost, and all costs thereof will be paid by the Company. The Company has retained the services of Kingsdale Advisors ("Kingsdale") as its strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent to assist the Company in soliciting proxies. The Company estimates the fees for Kingsdale associated with this year's proxy solicitation will be C$45,000 plus disbursements.
There are two kinds of non-registered, or beneficial, Shareholders – those who object to their name being made known to the issuers of securities which they own (called "OBOs" for Objecting Beneficial Owners) and those who do not object to the issuers of the securities they own knowing who they are (called "NOBOs" for Non Objecting Beneficial Owners). In accordance with National Instrument 54-101 - Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer ("NI 54-101"), the Company has elected to send the Notice of Meeting, this Circular and the related form of proxy or voting instruction form indirectly to the NOBOs and to the OBOs through their intermediaries. Unless required by the rules of the NYSE American, the Company does not intend to pay for intermediaries to forward to OBOs, under NI 54-101, the proxy related materials and Form 54-101F7, and in the case of an OBO, the OBO will not receive these materials unless the OBO's intermediary assumes the cost of delivery.
If you have any questions or need assistance completing your form of proxy or voting instruction form, please contact our strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent, Kingsdale, toll free in North America at 1-866-228-8818, or call collect from outside North America at 416-867-2272, or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.
Notice and Access
The Company uses the "Notice and Access" provisions in securities laws that permit the Company to forego mailing paper copies of this Circular and proxy-related materials to Shareholders and instead make them available for review, print and download via the Internet. Registered and non-registered Shareholders have received a Notice Package (as defined below), but will not receive a paper copy of this Circular or the proxy-related materials unless they request such documents as described in the Notice Package.
In accordance with the requirements of NI 54-101 and SEC rules, the Company has distributed a notice (the "Notice Package") in the form prescribed by NI 54-101 and SEC rules to the clearing agencies and intermediaries for onward distribution to non-registered Shareholders of the website location where non-registered Shareholders may access the Notice of Meeting, this Circular and the instrument of proxy (collectively, the "Meeting Materials"). Intermediaries are required to forward the Notice Package to non-registered Shareholders unless a non-registered Shareholder has waived the right to receive Meeting Materials. Typically, intermediaries will use a service company (such as Broadridge Financial Services Inc. ("Broadridge")) to forward the Notice Package to non-registered Shareholders.
If you have any questions or need assistance completing your form of proxy or voting instruction form, please call Kingsdale Advisors at 1-866-228-8818 or email them at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.

Record Date and Quorum
The Board of Directors of the Company has fixed the record date for the Meeting as the close of business on March 18, 2019 (the "Record Date"). If a person acquires ownership of shares subsequent to the Record Date such person may establish a right to vote by delivering evidence of ownership of common shares of the Company ("Common Shares") satisfactory to the Board and a request to be placed on the voting list to Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, the Company's legal counsel, at Suite 2600, 595 Burrard Street, Three Bentall Centre, Vancouver, BC, V7X 1L3, Attention: Trisha Robertson. Subject to the above, all registered holders of Common Shares at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. No cumulative rights are authorized and dissenter's rights are not applicable to any matters being voted upon. Each registered Shareholder will be entitled to one vote per Common Share.
Two or more persons present in person or by proxy representing at least 25% of the Common Shares entitled to vote at the Meeting will constitute a quorum at the Meeting.
Voting Standards
Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner who holds company stock through a broker does not provide the broker with voting instructions as to any matter on which the broker is not permitted to exercise its discretion and vote without specific instruction. As a result, the broker will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to those shares. Broker non-votes may exist in connection with the election of directors and all proposals other than the appointment of auditors.
The following chart describes the proposals to be considered at the meeting, the voting options, the vote required for each matter, and the manner in which votes will be counted:

How to Vote
Registered Shareholders
Registered Shareholders have two methods by which they can vote their shares at the Meeting, namely in person or by proxy. To assure your representation at the Meeting, please complete, sign, date and return the proxy included with this Circular. Sending your proxy will not prevent you from voting in person at the Meeting.
Shareholders who do not wish to attend the Meeting or do not wish to vote in person can vote by proxy. A registered Shareholder must return the completed proxy to the Company:
If you have any questions or need assistance completing your form of proxy or voting instruction form, please call Kingsdale Advisors at 1-866-228-8818 or email them at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.

The persons named in the form of proxy are officers or directors of the Company ("Directors"). Each Shareholder has the right to appoint a person or a company (who need not be a Shareholder) to attend and act for him/her and on his/her behalf at the Meeting other than the persons designated in the form of proxy. Such right may be exercised by striking out the names of the persons designated on the form of proxy and by inserting such appointed person's name in the blank space provided for that purpose or by completing another form of proxy acceptable to the Board.
Non-Registered Shareholders
The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many Shareholders of the Company, as a substantial number of Shareholders do not hold Common Shares in their own name. Shareholders who do not hold their Common Shares in their own name (i.e. non-registered or beneficial Shareholders) should note that only proxies deposited by Shareholders whose names appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of Common Shares can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting. If Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to a Shareholder by a broker, then, in almost all cases, those Common Shares will not be registered in the Shareholder's name on the records of the Company. Such Common Shares will more likely be registered under the name of the Shareholder's broker or an agent of that broker. In Canada and the United States, the vast majority of such Common Shares are registered under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms) or Cede & Co. (operated by The Depository Trust Company), respectively. Common Shares held by brokers or their agents or nominees can only be voted upon the instructions of the non-registered Shareholder except in limited cases for certain "routine" matters. An example of a "routine" matter includes the appointment of the Auditors, which is considered the only "routine" matter to be voted upon at the Meeting. Otherwise, without specific instructions, a broker and its agents and nominees are prohibited from voting Common Shares for the broker's clients, which is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." Therefore, non-registered Shareholders should ensure that instructions respecting the voting of their Common Shares are communicated to the appropriate person if such Shareholders want their votes to count on all matters to be decided at the Meeting.
Applicable regulatory policy requires intermediaries/brokers to seek voting instructions from non-registered Shareholders in advance of shareholders' meetings. Every intermediary/broker has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by non-registered Shareholders in order to ensure that their shares are voted at the Meeting. The majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge. Broadridge typically uses its own voting form (known as a voting instruction form or VIF), mails those forms to the non-registered Shareholders and asks non-registered Shareholders to either return the VIF to Broadridge or alternatively provide voting instructions by using the Broadridge automated telephone system. Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of Common Shares to be represented at the Meeting. A non-registered Shareholder receiving a VIF from Broadridge cannot use that VIF to vote Common Shares directly at the Meeting – the VIF must be returned to Broadridge well in advance of the Meeting in accordance with Broadridge's instructions in order to have the shares voted.
Although a non-registered Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting Common Shares registered in the name of his/her broker (or an agent of the broker), a non-registered Shareholder may attend the Meeting as the proxyholder for a registered Shareholder and vote the Common Shares in that capacity. Non-registered Shareholders who wish to attend the Meeting and indirectly vote their Common Shares as the proxyholder for a registered Shareholder should enter their own names in the blank space on the VIF provided to them by their broker (or agent) and return the same to their broker (or the broker's agent) in accordance with the instructions provided by such broker (or agent), well in advance of the Meeting.

Exercise of Proxies
On any ballot that may be called for, the Common Shares represented by a properly executed proxy given in favor of the person(s) designated in the form of proxy will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with the instructions given on the form of proxy and, if the Shareholder specifies a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the Common Shares will be voted accordingly. Where no choice is specified, the proxy will confer discretionary authority and will be voted in favor of all matters referred to on the form of proxy.
The proxy also confers discretionary authority to vote for, withhold or abstain from voting, or vote against, amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting and with respect to other matters not specifically mentioned in the Notice of Meeting but which may properly come before the Meeting. Management has no present knowledge of any amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting or any business other than that referred to in the accompanying Notice of Meeting which will be presented at the Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Meeting, it is the intention of the management designees named in the proxy to vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Company's management.

The time limit for deposit of proxies may be waived or extended by the Chair of the Meeting at their discretion, without notice.
Revocation of Proxies
A Shareholder who has given a proxy may revoke it at any time insofar as it has not been exercised. In addition to any other manner permitted by law, a registered Shareholder who has given an instrument of proxy may revoke it by instrument in writing, executed by the Shareholder or by their attorney authorized in writing, or if the Shareholder is a Company, under its corporate seal, and deposited either with Computershare at its Toronto office at 100 University Avenue, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2Y1 or with the Company's legal counsel, Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, at Suite 2600, 595 Burrard Street, Three Bentall Centre, Vancouver, BC, V7X 1L3, Attention: Trisha Robertson, at any time up to and including the last business day preceding the Meeting at which the proxy is to be used, or any adjournment thereof, or with the chairman of such Meeting on the date of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, and upon either of such deposits the proxy is revoked. A registered Shareholder attending the Meeting has the right to vote in person, and if the registered Shareholder does so, any proxy previously given is nullified with respect to the matters such person votes upon and any subsequent matters thereafter to be voted upon at the Meeting.
Voting Shares and Principal Holders Thereof
As of March 18, 2019, the Company had 325,242,605 Common Shares issued and outstanding without nominal or par value. Each Common Share is entitled to one vote. Except as otherwise noted in this Circular, a simple majority of votes cast at the Meeting, whether in person or by proxy, will constitute approval of any matter submitted to a vote.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of the Company's Common Shares as of March 18, 2019, by each Shareholder known to the Company who beneficially owns, or exercises control or direction over, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company as of that date, based solely on such person's most recent Schedules 13D or 13G or Form 4 filed with the SEC.

MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON AT MEETING
Number of Directors
According to the Articles of the Company, the Board shall consist of not less than three and no more than such number of Directors to be determined by resolution of Shareholders. Shareholders of the Company will be asked to consider and, if thought appropriate, to approve and adopt an ordinary resolution setting the number of Directors at 10. In the absence of a contrary instruction, it is intended that all proxies received will be voted FOR setting the number of Directors at 10.
Election of Directors
The proposed nominees in the list that follows, in the opinion of management, are well qualified to direct the Company's activities for the ensuing year and have confirmed their willingness to serve as Directors, if elected. The term of office of each Director elected will be until the next annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company or until a successor is elected or appointed, unless the Director's office is vacated earlier, in accordance with the Articles of the Company and the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
The Board has adopted a Majority Voting Policy stipulating that Shareholders shall be entitled to vote in favor of, or withhold from voting for, each individual director nominee at a Shareholders' meeting. If the number of Common Shares "withheld" for any nominee exceeds the number of Common Shares voted "for" the nominee, then, notwithstanding that such Director was duly elected as a matter of corporate law, the Director shall immediately tender their written resignation to the Chair of the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee will consider such offer of resignation and will make a recommendation to the Board concerning the acceptance or rejection of the resignation. No Director who is required to tender their resignation pursuant to this policy shall participate in the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee's deliberations or recommendations or in the Board's deliberations or determination. The Board must take formal action on the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee's recommendation within 90 days of the date of the applicable Shareholders' meeting and shall announce its decision promptly by press release, including the reasons for its decision. The resignation will be effective when accepted by the Board. The Board will be expected to accept the resignations tendered pursuant to this policy absent exceptional circumstances. If the Board declines to accept a resignation tendered pursuant to this policy, it will include in the press release the reason or reasons for its decision. See "Statement of Corporate Governance Policies – Majority Voting Policy."

Refer to the Section titled "Information Concerning the Board of Directors and Executive Officers" beginning on page 11 of this Circular for further information regarding the above Directors and Director nominees. Management has proposed a slate of nine Director nominees, which means immediately following the 2019 Meeting the Company's Board will have one vacancy. That seat will remain vacant until the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee identifies a suitable candidate for such seat and such candidate is appointed or elected to the Board of Directors.
Appointment of Auditors
The independent auditors of the Company are PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants ("PwC"), located at 250 Howe Street, Suite 1400, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PwC were appointed auditors of the Company ("Auditors") on May 4, 2018 by the Shareholders. The Shareholders will be asked at the Meeting to vote for the appointment of PwC as Auditors until the next annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company or until a successor is appointed, at a remuneration to be fixed by the Directors through the Audit Committee. To the Company's knowledge, a representative from PwC will be present at the Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. PwC will also be permitted to make a statement if it so desires.
PwC fees for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
All services to be performed by the Company's Auditors must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of services other than audit services is compatible with maintaining the Auditors' independence and has adopted a charter governing its conduct. The charter is reviewed annually and requires the pre-approval of all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by its Auditors, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services as allowed by applicable law or regulation. The Audit Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such a subcommittee to grant pre-approvals shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Pursuant to these procedures, all services and related fees reported were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") reviewed and discussed with management and the Company's Auditors the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018. Management and PwC indicated that the Company's consolidated financial statements were fairly stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Committee discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. The Committee discussed with PwC matters covered by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards, including PCAOB AS 16 Communication with Audit Committees and implementation of the new Critical Audit Matters (CAM) reporting model starting with a dry run implementation as part of the fiscal year 2018 audit and full implementation as required for the fiscal year 2019 audit. In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the related audits performed by PwC, which confirmed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Committee also discussed with PwC its independence from the Company and management, including the communications PwC is required to provide to the Committee under applicable PCAOB rules. PwC assigned a new partner to oversee the Company's audit beginning with fiscal year 2018 in accordance with SEC rules requiring a change in audit partner every five years. The Committee considered the non-audit services provided by PwC to the Company and concluded that the auditors' independence has been maintained. Based on the review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC, which Annual Report is available on the Company's website at www.novagold.com, under the Company's profile on EDGAR at www.sec.gov, and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Audit Committee of the Board
Anthony Walsh, Chair
Kalidas Madhavpeddi
Clynton Nauman
In the absence of a contrary instruction, the person(s) designated in the form of proxy by the Company intend to vote FOR the appointment of PwC as auditors of the Company until the next annual meeting of Shareholders or until a successor is appointed, at a remuneration to be fixed by the Directors through the Audit Committee.
Additional Matters to be Acted Upon
Non-Binding Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
In accordance with Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the following proposal, commonly known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives our Shareholders the opportunity to vote to approve or not approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation received by Gregory Lang, David Deisley and David Ottewell (together, the "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs") during fiscal year 2018. Mr. Deisley retired as the Company's Executive Vice President and General Counsel on December 31, 2018. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and our compensation philosophy, policies and practices, as disclosed under the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Circular.
Our executive compensation program is designed to recruit and retain key individuals and reward them with compensation that has long-term growth potential while recognizing that the executives work as a team to achieve corporate results and should be rewarded accordingly. In order to align executive pay with both the Company's performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value, a significant portion of compensation paid to our NEOs is allocated to performance-based, short-term and long-term incentive programs to make executive pay dependent on the Company's performance (also known as "at-risk compensation"). In addition, as an executive officer's responsibility and ability to affect the financial results of the Company increases, the portion of their total compensation deemed "at-risk" increases. Shareholders are urged to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Circular, which more thoroughly discusses how our compensation policies and procedures are aligned with our compensation philosophy.
If you have any questions or need assistance completing your form of proxy or voting instruction form, please call Kingsdale Advisors at 1-866-228-8818 or email them at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com.

We are asking our Shareholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this Circular by voting FOR the following resolution:
BE IT RESOLVED, as an ordinary resolution, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers in fiscal year 2018, as disclosed in the Company's 2019 Circular pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion that accompanies the compensation tables), is hereby approved.
While we intend to carefully consider the voting results of this proposal, the final vote is advisory in nature and therefore not binding on us, our Board or the Compensation Committee. Our Board and Compensation Committee value the opinions of our Shareholders and will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. The Board believes that submitting the non-binding vote on compensation of the Company's NEOs to Shareholders on an annual basis is appropriate for the Company and its Shareholders at this time.
In the absence of a contrary instruction, the person(s) designated in the form of proxy by the Company intend to vote FOR the approval of the non-binding resolution approving the compensation paid to the NEOs as disclosed in this Circular. 
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, DIRECTOR NOMINEES, AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our Directors and executive officers. The term for each Director expires at the next annual meeting of Shareholders or at such time as a qualified successor is appointed, upon ceasing to meet the qualifications for election as a director, upon death, upon removal by the Shareholders or upon delivery or submission to the Company of the Director's written resignation, unless the resignation specifies a later time of resignation. Each executive officer shall hold office until the earliest of the date the officer's resignation becomes effective, the date a successor is appointed or the officer ceases to be qualified for that office, or the date the officer is terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company. The name, location of residence, age, and office held by each Director and executive officer, current as of March 18, 2019, has been furnished by each of them and is presented in the following table. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each current Director, and executive officer in the table set forth below is care of NOVAGOLD, 201 South Main, Suite 400, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111, United States.

compensation discussion & analysis
2018 Post-Proxy Season Shareholder Engagement
During our 2018 proxy season engagement campaign we contacted shareholders representing just over 80% of the Company's shares. Subsequently, in August and September 2018, Company management invited 10 of the largest Shareholders whom were believed to have voted against the Company's Say-on-Pay resolution to discuss executive compensation matters. The CEO did not participate in these meetings. Six of those shareholders representing approximately 14.65% of the Company's outstanding shares responded. Two sent email responses, and four agreed to a telephonic meeting. We conducted a more extensive shareholder engagement campaign following our 2017 annual shareholder meeting that included members of our Compensation Committee (referred to in this Compensation Discussion & Analysis section as the "Committee"). We undertook these additional, enhanced engagement campaigns to ensure that changes to our executive compensation program incorporated feedback from our Shareholders. A summary of the key feedback received from Shareholders and the Company's response to that feedback is contained in the following table:

Top management is overcompensated•  CEO base salary was frozen for the second year in a row; see Base Salary Increases for 2019 on page 40 below.•  Eliminated the individual performance multiplier in the formula for long-term equity compensation,  which had the effect of decreasing equity grants awarded to executives in 2018 and beyond versus previous years.

Provide more information about annual company goals and achievement•  Enhanced our description of annual company goals,                                           including threshold, target and maximum achievement descriptions, under the Annual Incentive Plan heading on page 41. As the Company is in the project development phase, typical                                           financial and production performance metrics available to producing companies are not                                           yet available to NOVAGOLD. 
Concerned about the lack of a double-trigger change in control provision in equity plans•  Amended the Company's 2004 Stock Award Plan (stock options) and 2009 Performance Share  Unit Plan (PSUs) effective as of January 23, 2019 to include a double-trigger change in control provision in each; see the description  of the 2004 Stock Award Plan and the description of the 2009 Performance Share Unit Plan on pages 76 and 78, respectively.

While we believe in rewarding our executive team for excellent job performance and successful achievement of company goals, we also believe that executive pay should include a significant component linked to long-term share price performance.
NOVAGOLD employees were instrumental in the achievement of important milestones relative to Donlin Gold and Galore Creek in 2018, including:

Some highlights of the 2018 executive compensation program include:
Overview
The following section of the Circular presents information regarding the design, governance, and implementation of the Company's compensation program. The Committee regularly reviews executive compensation. However, in response to the Company's 2017 advisory vote on executive compensation approval rate, the Committee and management undertook an additional engagement program to solicit commentary from Shareholders following the 2017 annual meeting. The Committee took the opportunity to respond to the Shareholder feedback received during these meetings by modifying the 2018 executive compensation program in line with key recommendations made by Shareholders. Additionally, in August and September 2018 management conducted a shareholder engagement campaign to hear from Shareholders the Company believed voted against the Company's 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation. In the following pages, we detail what we heard from Shareholders, our analysis of the feedback, and the changes we made in response.
During 2012, the Company implemented a fundamental restructuring which repositioned the Company as a pure gold play focused on permitting and developing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest-known undeveloped open-pit gold deposits. The restructuring included the spinout to the Company's Shareholders of Trilogy Metals Inc. (formerly known as NovaCopper Inc.), the hiring of Gregory Lang as President and CEO, and his recruitment of a new executive team with demonstrated experience in permitting, engineering, building and operating large, open-pit gold mines in remote locations.
Because of Donlin Gold's unique attributes and the Company's relationships with major international mining companies at both the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek properties, the Company designed its compensation program to attract, retain, and incentivize individuals who have experience with complex, large scale development properties and in senior management roles with large international mining companies.
The Board and management believe that every employee should be an owner of the Company because ownership is fundamental to aligning management's and employees' interests with those of the Shareholders. As a result, share-based compensation is an important component of the Company's compensation program. In addition, the Company is committed to aligning management compensation with Shareholder interests through performance-based compensation. As Donlin Gold is in the development stage, the Company is not able to use typical operating company metrics (e.g., revenues, operating cash flow, production, costs, net income) as the basis for the performance-based components of its compensation program. The Committee worked extensively with management and with its compensation consultant, Mercer (Canada) Limited ("Mercer" or the "Compensation Consultant"), to define criteria for all aspects of the Company's 2018 compensation program, in particular the performance-based compensation.

Compensation Governance
The Committee is a standing committee of the Board and is appointed by and reports to the Board, with a mandate to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to:
The charter of the Committee is available at www.novagold.com under the Governance tab. More information regarding the responsibilities and operation of the Committee and the process by which compensation is determined are discussed starting on page 31 in "Statement of Executive Compensation" and on page 68 below under the heading "Non-Executive Director Compensation".
For the year ended November 30, 2018, the Committee consisted of three independent Directors: Kalidas Madhavpeddi (Chair), Sharon Dowdall and Anthony Walsh. All current members of the Committee are non-executive Directors of the Company, satisfy all applicable independence standards of the NYSE American, and are "outside directors" as defined by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee met seven times in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. More information regarding the qualifications of each of the members of the Committee is provided in "Information Concerning the Board of Directors and Executive Officers" above.
Compensation Committee's Relationship with its Independent Compensation Consultant
The Committee has directly engaged Mercer to provide specific support to the Committee in determining compensation for the Company's officers and Directors, including during the most recently completed fiscal year. Such analysis and advice from the Compensation Consultant includes, but is not limited to, executive compensation policy (for example, the choice of companies to include in the Peer Group (as defined below) and compensation philosophy), total compensation benchmarking for the NEOs, and incentive plan design. In addition, this support has also consisted of (i) the provision of general market observations throughout the year with respect to market trends and compensation governance issues; (ii) the provision of benchmark market data; and (iii) attendance at Committee meetings. Decisions made by the Committee, however, are the responsibility of the Committee and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and recommendations provided by the Compensation Consultant. In addition to this mandate, the Compensation Consultant provides general employee compensation consulting services to the Company; however, these services are limited in size and scope and are of significantly lesser value than those provided related to executive officer and Director compensation.
The Committee Chair pre-approves a Statement of Work provided by the Compensation Consultant prior to the start of the annual executive officer and Director compensation reviews, or any other special project. The Statement of Work confirms the work that the Compensation Consultant is asked to complete and the associated fees. The Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that the Compensation Consultant's work for the Committee does not raise any conflict of interest. The Committee regularly assesses the performance of the Compensation Consultant and may, from time to time, determine that obtaining competitive proposals is appropriate.
-28-
The fees paid to the Compensation Consultant for services performed in fiscal year 2018 were C$60,130 to assist the Committee in developing the Company's compensation policies and programs. No other fees were paid to the Compensation Consultant for services provided to the Committee during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. In fiscal year 2017, Mercer was paid C$67,880 to perform similar services. The Compensation Consultant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC). Marsh Risk & Insurance Services ("Marsh"), an MMC affiliate, provides insurance broker services to the Company. The engagement of Marsh did not require or receive approval of the Board or the Committee. During the year ended November 30, 2018, Marsh billed the Company $99,575 for insurance brokerage services. With respect to the engagement of Mercer, the Committee considered various factors that may impact the independence of Mercer, including the amounts payable to Mercer and Marsh as described above, and whether any other relationships existed between Mercer or Marsh, on the one hand, and any executive officer of the Company or any member of the Board, on the other hand, and the Committee determined that a conflict of interest did not exist.
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
Annually, the Committee conducts a risk assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices as they apply to all employees, including all executive officers. The design features and performance metrics of the Company's cash and stock-based incentive programs, along with the approval mechanisms associated with each, are evaluated to determine whether any of these policies and practices would create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
As part of the review, the following characteristics of the Company's compensation policies and practices were noted as being characteristics that the Company believes reduce the likelihood of risk-taking by the Company's employees, including the Company's officers and non-officers:
Based on this assessment, the Committee concluded that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Employees of NOVAGOLD, including NEOs, and Directors are not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the employee or Director. Additionally, the Company does not permit any employees or Directors to pledge Company securities to secure personal debts or loans.
Peer Group for 2018 Executive Compensation Planning
On August 8, 2017, the Committee retained the Compensation Consultant to assist the Committee in determining appropriate levels for each of the three main components of total direct compensation for the Company's Directors and NEOs for fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Consultant's work encompasses a review of the Company's executive compensation philosophies relative to a comparable group of mining companies using the publicly available filings of these peer companies.
-29-
A compensation peer group of mining companies was developed using the following selection criteria:
The Company considers the above selection criteria to be relevant because it results in a group of companies in our industry that are similar in size, operating jurisdictions and/or stage of development.
Based upon considerations of the selection criteria, stage of development and operating jurisdictions, the following peer group companies were selected:

(collectively, the "Peer Group"). Relative to the Peer Group, NOVAGOLD's market capitalization was at the 37th percentile, and its asset value was at the 16th percentile as of August 31, 2017, which was near the time the Peer Group for 2018 executive compensation was selected.
Peer Group for 2019 Executive Compensation Planning
The Committee followed a similar process for the selection of the peer group for 2019 executive compensation planning in the second half of fiscal year 2018. The 2019 peer group is unchanged from the 2018 peer group.
Statement of Executive Compensation
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes and explains the significant elements of the Company's executive compensation program which was implemented during fiscal year 2018 to attract, retain and incentivize the Company's NEOs.
The Company's NEOs during fiscal 2018 were:
Mr. Deisley retired as the Company's Executive Vice President and General Counsel on December 31, 2018.
Executive Compensation Philosophy
NOVAGOLD has a pay-for-performance philosophy and the compensation programs of the Company are designed to attract and retain executive officers with the talent and experience necessary for the success of the Company. As directed by the Committee, the Company has a compensation philosophy to pay above the median of its Peer Group companies to attract and retain above average executive talent. Factors which influence this policy include the large size and scale of the Company's precious metals deposits as compared to those of our Peer Group companies and the acknowledgement that managing these resources requires an executive team with extensive experience and skills in advancing significant deposits into production. Additionally, the Company works with senior mining partners as it advances its complex, large-scale project and needs to attract and retain executives with specialized skills, knowledge and experience which come from working for and with large mining companies. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, engineering, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, regulation, mine construction and operation, government and community affairs, compliance, marketing, financing and accounting.
-31-
As part of its 2018 executive compensation planning, the Committee also referred to the compensation paid by senior mining companies to their incumbents in positions comparable to those held by the Company's NEOs. Although not included in the Peer Group, the Committee also referenced the compensation packages of Goldcorp Inc., Kinross Gold Corporation, Barrick Gold Corporation and Newmont Mining Corporation, as (i) the NEOs have all previously worked for at least one of those senior mining companies and to measure the competitiveness of the Company's compensation programs, and (ii) the Committee considers those companies as competitors for executive talent. No changes to the Company's compensation programs were made as a result of the supplemental review of the compensation programs of these senior mining companies. Ultimately, the Peer Group companies were selected to reflect the fact that the Company's assets are in the development stage.
The Committee evaluates each officer position to establish skill requirements and levels of responsibility. The Committee, after referring to market information provided by its independent Compensation Consultant, Mercer, and after considering the CEO's recommendations for compensation of the Company's other officers, makes recommendations to the Board regarding compensation for the officers. The Company regularly meets with its major Shareholders to discuss a variety of matters relevant to the Company. At the request of the Committee, the Company includes the issue of executive compensation in such discussions and provides feedback from the Shareholders to the Committee.
The Committee believes that the Company's executive compensation program structure has been successful in achieving the goals set out in the Committee's compensation philosophy, namely attracting and retaining above-average executive talent who have worked for and with large mining companies, and who have specialized skills, knowledge and experience necessary to advance the Company's substantial and complex project. As such, the executive compensation program targets remained unchanged from 2017 to 2018. The Committee currently targets NEO compensation as follows:
Executive Compensation Objectives and Elements
In establishing compensation objectives for the NEOs, the Committee seeks to accomplish the following goals:
During 2018, the Company's executive compensation package consisted of the following principal components: base salary, annual incentive cash bonus, various welfare plan benefits, 401(k) retirement account ("401(k)") employer matching funds for U.S. NEOs, and long-term incentives in the form of stock options and Performance Share Units (PSUs).

Achievement of the foregoing strategic goals will be measured at the end of fiscal 2019 by assessing completion of the underlying tactical goals. Based upon the level of completion of the goals, performance ratings are determined for the Company by the Board and for each of the NEOs by the Committee. These Company and individual performance ratings are used in making decisions and calculations related to base salary increases and annual incentive payments.
The Board can exercise discretion in determining the appropriate performance rating for the Company and for the executive officers based on their evaluation of performance against goals set at the beginning of the year. The size of any payment or award is dependent on the Company and the individual performance ratings as determined by the Committee and Board. The ratings can range between 0% and 150%, with 100% being the target and 150% being the maximum.
The Committee makes a recommendation to the Board regarding the NEOs' base salary and annual incentive payments. Stock option and PSU grants for NEOs are also approved by the Board and are based upon a fixed long-term incentive target for each NEO expressed as a percentage of the NEO's base salary.
Base salary increases, if granted, are effective January 1 of each year and annual incentive payments are usually made shortly after the end of the fiscal year, which concludes each year on November 30.
The chart below illustrates the 2018 targeted and actual pay mix for the CEO and other NEOs. The actual 2018 pay mix is based on compensation earned in fiscal year 2018; however, the annual incentive amounts and long-term incentive amounts earned in 2018 were paid or awarded after the close of fiscal year 2018. The NEOs' target pay mix remains unchanged from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2019.

Compensation Elements
After compiling information based on salaries, bonuses and other types of cash and equity-based compensation programs obtained from the public disclosure records of the Peer Group, the Compensation Consultant reported its findings and made recommendations to the Committee regarding compensation targets for Directors and NEOs.
The Committee has set the following compensation targets for the Company's NEOs for the 2019 fiscal year, which were unchanged from fiscal year 2018:
-38-
In addition, our NEOs receive compensation in the form of Company-paid health and welfare benefits (medical, dental, vision, life, AD&D, short-term and long-term disability insurance) and a Company match on 401(k) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan contributions, which benefits are offered on par to all employees. Our NEOs are entitled to one paid executive physical per year, and Mr. Lang receives an auto allowance. The foregoing items of NEO compensation are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 56 of this Circular.
Base Salary
Salaries for officers are determined by evaluating the responsibilities inherent in the position held and each individual's experience and past performance, as well as by reference to the competitive marketplace for management talent at the Peer Group companies. The Committee refers to market information provided by the Compensation Consultant on an annual basis. The Compensation Consultant matches the executives to those individuals performing similar functions at the Peer Group companies. For the 2018 fiscal year, the Company set the 62.5th percentile of this market data as a target for base salaries.
As explained in the section "Executive Compensation Philosophy" above, the Company targets base salaries above the median of salaries paid by the Peer Group companies to assist in attracting and retaining the highly experienced people that the Company needs to be successful.
If an NEO is fully competent in their position, the NEO will be paid between 95% and 105% of the guidepost. Developing NEOs are generally paid between 80% and 94% of the guidepost and NEOs who are highly experienced and consistently perform above expectations can be paid between 106% and 120% of the guidepost.

Base Salaries for 2019
In response to Shareholder feedback received during the engagement campaigns conducted by management in the spring and fall of 2018, the Committee recommended and the Board approved a salary freeze for Mr. Lang for 2019. The Committee made its recommendation primarily because Mr. Lang's base salary is nearing the high end of his pay band, and not as any reflection on the job performance of Mr. Lang.
The Board agreed with the Committee's recommendations and approved the following base salaries to be effective as of January 1, 2019 for Mr. Lang and Mr. Ottewell. Mr. Deisley retired from the Company as of December 31, 2018:

Annual Incentive Plan
At the end of each fiscal year, the Committee reviews individual performance and Company performance against the goals set by the Company for such fiscal year. The assessment of whether the Company's goals for the year have been met includes, but is not limited to, considering the quality and measured progress at the Company's development stage projects, strong safety record, protection of the Company's treasury, corporate alliances and similar achievements.
The formula for determining NEO annual incentive payments each year is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
STEP 1:  Company Performance Rating multiplied by          80%   (A x B)   PLUS  Individual Performance Rating multiplied          by 20%   (C x D)

STEP 2:  The NEO's annual incentive target (%)   E   MULTIPLIED BY  The NEO's annual base salary ($)   F

STEP 2:  The NEO's annual incentive target (%)   E   MULTIPLIED BY  The NEO's annual base salary ($)   F   
[END TABLE]
The Company performance component is weighted more heavily than the individual performance component in the formula above for each of the NEOs due to the level of influence the NEOs are expected to have over the Company's performance.
Annual Incentive Payment for 2018
Annual incentive awards for 2018 were based on performance relative to goals set at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Performance is measured in two areas: company and individual. Performance ratings for each area range from 0% to 150%, with 100% being the performance target and 150% being the maximum.
Discussions around Company goals for the following year commence during strategy sessions that begin in the fall of the preceding year. The NEOs, the other officers and some managers are involved in the strategy sessions. These Company goals are reviewed and approved by the Committee and Board. Individual goals flow down from the Company goals to ensure that everyone's efforts are aligned with the goals and linked to the success of the Company.
The Company also focuses on setting goals around its core values which include safety, sustainability, accountability, communication, empowerment, integrity, respect and teamwork.
The 2018 Company goals included:

The foregoing table shows the actual annual incentive payment made to each NEO for their performance in 2018 in column G. The table in the section titled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" below displays the target and maximum annual incentive payouts available to each NEO for fiscal year 2018.
Stock-Based Incentive Plans (Long-Term Incentives)
Stock-based grants are generally awarded to officers at the commencement of their employment and periodically thereafter. Annual grants of stock options and/or PSUs are made based on a target percentage of base salary for each NEO. The purpose of granting stock options and/or PSUs is to assist the Company in compensating, attracting, retaining and motivating directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company and to closely align the personal interests of such persons to those of the Shareholders. These equity vehicles were chosen because the Company believes that these vehicles best incentivize the team to focus their efforts on increasing Shareholder value over the long-term.
The Committee targeted the 75th percentile of the total direct compensation data provided by the Compensation Consultant for the NEOs. The Company uses two different plans for stock-based grants for its NEOs: the Stock Award Plan (stock options) and the PSU Plan. The percentage of stock options versus PSUs granted is determined by the Committee for each grant. The Company's Stock Award Plan was adopted on May 11, 2004, and the PSU Plan was adopted on May 26, 2009. The Stock Award Plan is for the benefit of the officers, Directors, employees and consultants of the Company or any subsidiary company, and the PSU Plan is for the benefit of the officers, employees and consultants of the Company or any subsidiary company. Stock options granted to the NEOs pursuant to the Stock Award Plan for performance in 2018 have a five-year life and vest over three years: 1/3 on the first anniversary of the grant date, 1/3 on the second anniversary of the grant date, and 1/3 on the third anniversary of the grant date. PSUs granted to the NEOs pursuant to the PSU Plan as of the date hereof generally have a three-year performance period between the grant date and the maturity date, when a vesting determination is made.

Stock-Based Grants
Feedback from Shareholders received during 2017 and 2018 has resulted in changes to stock-based grants made in fiscal years 2018 and 2019:
Following the proxy season and post-proxy season shareholder engagement campaigns conducted in 2018, the Committee recommended, and in January 2019 the Board approved, an amendment to the 2004 Stock Award Plan and to the 2009 Performance Share Unit Plan to include a double-trigger for accelerated vesting of awards under those plans in the event of a change of control.
In response to Shareholder feedback received during the engagement campaign conducted by management and members of the Committee following the 2017 Meeting, the Committee recommended, and the Board approved two significant changes to stock-based grants made in 2018:
The value of each NEO's long-term incentive (LTI) award is calculated as follows:
Half of the resulting LTI award value is then divided by the Black-Scholes value of the Company's Common Shares at fiscal year-end to arrive at the number of stock options to be granted. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model include the Company's historical stock price to determine the stock's volatility, the expected life of the option, which is based on the average length of time similar option grants in the past have remained outstanding prior to exercise, and the vesting period of the grant.
The remaining half of the LTI award value is divided by the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on the NYSE American at fiscal year-end to determine the number of PSUs to be granted.
The Board of Directors approved the grant of 1,303,600 stock options and 522,100 PSUs in aggregate to Mr. Lang and Mr. Ottewell effective December 1, 2018, in recognition of their performance during fiscal year 2018. Mr. Deisley retired from the Company on December 31, 2018 and as a result did not receive any stock-based grants on December 1, 2018. These grants comprise 50% of each NEO's LTI award value in stock options and 50% in PSUs.
The PSUs granted to the NEOs on December 1, 2018 will mature in three years on or about December 1, 2021. The Committee anticipates that future PSU grants to the NEOs will mature over three years. The number of PSUs vesting for each NEO granted for 2018 performance will be based on the Company's Common Share price performance relative to the share price performance of the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index between the PSU grant date and December 1, 2021 (the "Performance Period"). The Committee has determined that applying other types of performance criteria to the PSUs based upon Company revenues or production targets is inappropriate at this time as the Company's assets are in the development stage. The Company's share price performance over the Performance Period will be converted to a percentage relative to the share price performance of the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index over the same Performance Period. The table below sets out the adjustment factors for determining the number of PSUs that will vest on or shortly after the maturity date upon the Committee's certification of the Company's share price performance relative to that of the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index over the applicable Performance Period:
-52-
*In the event the Company's share price return is negative over the Performance Period, vesting shall be capped at 100%.
Stock options granted to the NEOs in fiscal year 2019 based on performance in fiscal year 2018 represented approximately 0.4% of the total Common Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2018. PSUs granted to the NEOs in fiscal year 2019 based on performance in fiscal year 2018 represented approximately 0.16% of the total Common Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2018. Stock options granted to all Company Directors, employees and service providers in fiscal year 2019 based on performance in fiscal year 2018 represented approximately 0.85% of the total Common Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2018. PSUs granted to all Company employees and service providers in fiscal year 2019 based on performance in fiscal year 2018 represented approximately 0.25% of the total Common Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2018.
The following table describes the long-term incentive awards to NEOs granted in fiscal 2019 based on performance in fiscal 2018:

In order to align the interests of the Company's senior executives with those of its Shareholders, the Company implemented share ownership guidelines for its senior executives in April 2009. Under the guidelines, a senior executive can satisfy the applicable share ownership requirement by holding Common Shares. Stock options and unvested PSUs do not count toward this requirement. Pursuant to the guidelines, senior executives must meet their share ownership requirements within five years of becoming a senior executive. There are no equity holding period requirements.
For the President and CEO, the share ownership requirement is that amount equal to the value of three times his annual base salary. In the case of the CFO and EVP, the share ownership requirement is that amount equal to the value of two times their annual base salary and, in the case of other executives, their annual base salary.

The programs consist of medical, dental, vision, life, disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and an employee assistance plan. The only benefits that NEOs receive beyond those provided to other employees is eligibility for a paid annual executive physical, and Mr. Lang receives an auto allowance.
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
In accordance with Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is asking you pursuant to this Circular to consider and, if deemed advisable, pass a non-binding resolution approving the compensation of the Company's NEOs as disclosed herein (the "Executive Compensation Resolution").

Realized and Realizable Pay (Supplemental Table)
To facilitate the Shareholders' comparison of executive pay and performance, the Company is also disclosing the average annual "realized" and "realizable" compensation, as well as the total annual "realized" and "realizable" compensation, over the last five fiscal years for our CEO and all other NEOs. Realized and realizable compensation are calculated similarly as described in the table below, but those amounts differ from the amounts in the "Summary Compensation Table" shown on page 56, prepared as required by the SEC. Realized and realizable compensation provide additional representations of executive compensation, but are not a substitute for the "Summary Compensation Table". Summary compensation table compensation (SCT), realized compensation and realizable compensation in the charts below includes the following elements of compensation found in the "Summary Compensation Table," however, the valuation methodology of certain of these elements differs, as noted below:
As shown in the chart below, realized compensation for our CEO and the other NEOs was lower than the five-year average annual compensation reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" (excluding "All Other Compensation") primarily due to the time required for vesting and exercise of option awards and due to the time required for vesting and payout of PSU awards. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the time between grant and vesting for option awards and PSU awards was extended to three years; option and PSU awards made prior to fiscal year 2018 vested over two years. The portion of average annual realizable compensation related to option awards was negatively impacted by subsequent decreases in the price of the Company's Common Shares, impacting option awards made in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Additionally, the elimination of the performance multiplier in the formula to calculate long-term incentive value, which is used to determine the number of PSUs and options granted to each NEO, resulted in a decrease in PSUs and option grants made in fiscal year 2018.
Realized pay and realizable pay in 2014 is the same for the CEO and other NEOs as all outstanding option awards have vested and were exercised, and all PSU awards were vested and paid out at 140% of the grant amount as the target performance criterion was exceeded. The 2014 realized pay and realizable pay amounts represent the actual value ultimately received by the CEO and other NEOs for salary, annual incentive, and options and PSUs granted during fiscal year 2014. The realized value attributable to options and PSUs granted in fiscal year 2014 were received in fiscal years 2016 and subsequent years.
CEO Pay Ratio – 10.98 to 1
We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform in ways that enhance shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees. The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to that of all other Company employees for the same period. The calculation of annual total compensation of all employees was determined in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" shown for our CEO in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 56 of this Circular. Pay elements that were included in the annual total compensation for each employee are:
Our calculation includes all employees as of November 30, 2018. We applied a Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate to the compensation elements paid in Canadian currency.
We determined the compensation of our median employee by: (i) calculating the annual total compensation described above for each of our employees, (ii) ranking the annual total compensation of all employees except for the CEO from lowest to highest (a list of 12 employees), and (iii) since we have an even number of employees when not including the CEO, determining the average of the annual total compensation of the two employees ranked sixth and seventh on the list ("Median Employee").
In adopting the pay ratio rule, the SEC expressly sought to provide flexibility to each company to determine the methodology that best suits its own facts and circumstances. Our pay ratio should not be compared to other companies' pay ratios, because it is based on a methodology specific to the Company, and certain material assumptions, adjustments and estimates have been made in the calculation of the pay ratio.
The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for our CEO was $4,601,424 and for the Median Employee was $419,087. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our Median Employee for fiscal year 2018 is 10.98 to 1.
Performance Graph
The following graph depicts the Company's cumulative total Shareholder returns over the five most recently completed fiscal years assuming a C$100 investment in Common Shares on November 29, 2013, compared to an equal investment in the S&P/TSX Composite Index (TSX ticker: ˄TSX) and in the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index (TSX ticker: ˄TTGD) on November 29, 2013. The Company does not currently issue dividends. The Common Share performance as set out in the graph is not indicative of future price performance.
Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The Company has no pension and no plans that provide for nonqualified deferred compensation to its NEOs.
Executive Employment Agreements
The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of the NEOs regarding, among other matters, the duties, tasks and responsibilities of each. Pursuant to an employment contract with the Company effective January 9, 2012, Mr. Lang is employed by the Company as President and CEO. Pursuant to an employment contract with the Company effective November 1, 2012, as amended December 15, 2016, Mr. Deisley was employed by the Company as Executive Vice President and General Counsel until his retirement effective December 31, 2018. Mr. Ottewell has entered into an employment agreement with NovaGold USA, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, effective November 13, 2012, and is employed as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. References in this section to the "Company", as such references relate to Mr. Ottewell, are to NovaGold USA, Inc., except with respect to a change of control in which case such references are to a change of control of the Company. The employment agreements continue indefinitely, unless and until terminated.
Compensation
Mr. Lang's salary is reviewed at least annually by the Board. The Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding appropriate salary adjustments. Mr. Ottewell's salary is reviewed at least annually by the CEO. The CEO may make recommendations to the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board regarding appropriate salary adjustments. The Company is obligated to provide the Named Executive Officers with group life, long-term disability, extended medical and dental insurance coverage in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company in effect from time to time.
Termination
Just Cause
The Company may terminate a Named Executive Officer's employment at any time for just cause.
Without Just Cause
The Company may terminate a Named Executive Officer's employment at any time without just cause upon making a severance payment in an amount equal to the Named Executive Officer's annual salary at the time of termination plus the annual incentive earned in the previous fiscal year, multiplied by two.
The Company will also continue the Named Executive Officer's group health and dental insurance benefits, if any, for a maximum period of 12 months or until such time as he subsequently becomes covered by another group health plan or otherwise loses eligibility for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) coverage, whichever is earlier, in accordance with COBRA and unless prohibited or restricted by applicable law. The Company will reimburse the Named Executive Officer on a tax-free basis for such COBRA premium payments. If the Company is unable to continue such group health and dental insurance benefits, or to provide them to the Named Executive Officer on a tax-favored basis, the Company will instead pay to the Named Executive Officer an amount equal to the present value of the Company's cost of providing such benefits, such amount to be paid as soon as possible following the Executive's termination but in any case by March 15 of the year following the year of termination. In addition, the Company will also pay to the Named Executive Officer, as soon as practical following termination of employment but in any event no later than March 15 of the year following the year of termination, a lump sum payment equal to the Company's cost of providing group life and long-term disability insurance coverage to the Named Executive Officer for a period of 12 months.
Material Breach or Default
A Named Executive Officer may terminate his employment agreement upon a material breach or default of any term of the employment agreement by the Company; provided, in the case of Mr. Lang, that Mr. Lang must advise the Company in writing of such breach or default within 90 days of the date he has become aware (or reasonably should have become aware) of the breach or default, and such breach or default has not been cured by the Company within 30 days from the receipt of such written notice and, in the case of Mr. Ottewell, that if such material breach or default is capable of being remedied by the Company, it has not been remedied within 30 days after written notice of the material breach or default has been delivered to the Company. If an employment agreement is terminated by the Named Executive Officer as a result of a material breach or default of any term of the employment agreement by the Company, the Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive the compensation to which the Named Executive Officer would be entitled if he were terminated without just cause.
Resignation
A Named Executive Officer may terminate his employment at any time upon providing three months' notice in writing to the Company.
Death or Disability
The Company may terminate a Named Executive Officer's employment at any time upon the Named Executive Officer's death or his becoming permanently disabled or disabled for a period exceeding 180 consecutive days or 180 non-consecutive days calculated on a cumulative basis over any two-year period during the term of the employment agreement. If the employment agreement is terminated due to the senior officer's death or disability, the Company will pay to the Named Executive Officer (or his estate) his then current salary accrued as of the date of termination and a lump sum equal to his then-current annual salary.
Change of Control
The employment agreements provide for certain payments upon a "double-trigger", which requires a "change of control", as defined below, and, within the 12-month period immediately following a change of control, either:
If the Named Executive Officer advises the Company in writing of the condition set forth above within 90 days of the date the Named Executive Officer has become aware (or reasonably should have become aware) of the condition, and the Company has not cured the condition within 30 days from the receipt of written notice, the Named Executive Officer's employment will be deemed to have been terminated by the Company. The Company will, immediately upon such termination, and in all cases on or before March 15 of the year following the year in which such termination occurs, make a lump sum payment to the Named Executive Officer in an amount equal to the Named Executive Officer's annual salary at the time of termination plus the Named Executive Officer's annual incentive earned in the previous fiscal year, multiplied by two. The Named Executive Officer will also be entitled to the same benefits as if he were terminated without just cause.
For the purposes of the employment agreements, a "change of control" means any of the following:
Release
In order for a Named Executive Officer to receive the severance payment and the payments with respect to group health, dental, life and disability coverage in the event of termination without just cause or upon breach or default by the Company under an employment agreement, the severance payment upon the Named Executive Officer's death or disability or the severance payment and the payments upon a double-trigger event, the Named Executive Officer agrees to enter into a separation agreement and release in a form agreeable to the Company, including a release of claims in the form provided by the Company, on or prior to the date of the expiration of any consideration period under applicable law.
Non-Solicitation
The Named Executive Officers are subject to non-solicitation provisions for a period of six months following termination of their employment for any reason.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table describes the estimated potential payments and benefits under the Company's compensation and benefit plans and contractual agreements to which the Named Executive Officers would have been entitled if a termination of employment or change in control occurred on November 30, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of the Named Executive Officer's departure from the Company. The amounts reported in the table below do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided generally to all salaried employees upon termination of employment and do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of the Named Executive Officers or include distributions of plan balances under our 401(k) plan or savings plans. The amounts reported assume payment of all previously earned and unpaid salary, vacation pay and short- and long-term incentive awards.

Non-Executive DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Company has targeted non-executive Director total direct compensation above the median of the Peer Group for the following reasons:
Compensation targets for non-executive Directors are:
At the request of the Compensation Committee, a review of non-executive Directors' compensation was conducted in October 2018. The Compensation Committee, after referring to market information provided by Mercer, determined to recommend one minor change to the Directors' fiscal year 2019 compensation program from that established by the Board for fiscal year 2018; specifically, a $4,000 per year increase to the Lead Director fee from $15,000 to $19,000 per year. It should be noted that in late 2017 the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, a change to all annual stock option grants made in 2018, including those grants made to non-executive Directors, to extend the vesting schedule from two years to three years in response to concerns raised by some shareholders during the post-proxy season shareholder engagement campaign conducted in the summer and fall of 2017. The non-executive Directors' full compensation package is described below.
Market compensation data was sourced from compensation data disclosed in the proxy statements of other publicly-traded companies. As with the Company's NEOs, the data was collected from the proxy statements of the companies included in NOVAGOLD's 2019 Peer Group consisting of: Alamos Gold Inc., Centerra Gold Inc., Coeur Mining Inc., Detour Gold Corporation, Guyana Goldfields Inc., Hecla Mining Company, IAMGOLD Corporation, Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd., MAG Silver Corporation, New Gold Inc., Pretium Resources Inc., Seabridge Gold Inc., Silver Standard Resources Inc., Tahoe Resources Inc., TMAC Resources Inc., and Torex Gold Resources Inc.
The largest portion of compensation paid to the non-executive Directors is in DSUs and stock option awards, which aligns the long-term interests of the non-executive Directors with those of the Shareholders as the value of the DSUs and stock option awards is dependent upon the Company's share price performance. Paying a larger portion of compensation to non-executive Directors in equity rather than cash also aligns the compensation program with the Company's strategy of protecting its treasury.
The table below describes the full compensation structure approved for non-executive Directors beginning in fiscal year 2019.

DSU Plan
The DSU Plan has been established to promote the interests of the Company by attracting and retaining qualified persons to serve on the Board and to provide the Directors with an opportunity to receive a portion of their compensation for serving as a Director in the form of securities of the Company. This vehicle also aligns the interests of non-executive Directors with those of the Shareholders by tying Directors' compensation to long-term Shareholder value.
Under the DSU Plan, each non-executive Director can elect to receive between no less than 50% and up to a maximum of 100% of their annual retainer in the form of DSUs. Directors are not eligible to receive the underlying Common Shares until they retire from service with the Company. This plan has been in effect since December 1, 2009. More information about the DSU Plan can be found on page 81.
The number of DSUs granted is determined quarterly by dividing the quarterly retainer amount by the volume weighted adjusted share price for the last five days of such quarter.
The following table sets forth the 2018 DSUs earned by each non-executive Director for service in fiscal year 2018, and the aggregate value of such payments is based on the $3.67 closing price of the Common Shares on the NYSE American on November 30, 2018. A total of 43,314 DSUs were paid to all non-executive Directors for service in fiscal year 2018, which number represents 0.013% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding as of November 30, 2018.
-70-
This supplemental table has been included to provide shareholders with additional compensation information for the prior year. The Company believes this supplemental table better enables shareholders to understand non-executive Director compensation considering the Company's practice of granting DSUs quarterly in arrears. However, this supplemental information is not intended to be a substitute for the information provided in the Non-Executive Director Compensation Table on page 69, which has been prepared in accordance with the SEC's disclosure rules.
The information contained in this supplemental table differs substantially from the compensation information contained in the Non-Executive Director Compensation Table on page 69 because the stock awards column in the Non-Executive Director Compensation Table reports awards actually granted during fiscal 2018, as opposed to equity awards granted in respect of that specific performance year. In addition, the value of DSUs earned by the non-executive Directors in this supplemental table is not based on the grant date fair value but rather the closing price of the Company's Common Shares on November 30, 2018.
Directors' Share Ownership
The Board established a policy in April 2009 requiring each Director to maintain a minimum holding of Common Shares and/or DSUs equal to C$50,000. Directors must meet these share ownership requirements by April 2014 or, if they became a Director subsequent to April 2009, within five years of becoming a Director. There are no equity holding period requirements. Upon meeting the share ownership requirement, a Director is deemed to have met the share ownership requirement going forward, regardless of changes in the price of a Common Share, so long as: (i) the Director's share ownership does not drop below the number of shares held at the time they first met the share ownership requirement, and (ii) the applicable share ownership requirement remains the same. Directors are not permitted to purchase financial instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of exchange funds that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity securities granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by the Director. Directors are also not permitted to pledge Company securities to secure personal debts or loans.

Value Vested or Earned During the Year
An award of 104,400 stock options was granted to each of the Canadian resident non-executive Directors during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018; and an award of 100,100 stock options was granted to each of the non-Canadian resident, non-executive Directors during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, except for Diane Garrett who joined the Board on May 4, 2018 and received a new director grant of 100,000 stock options on May 7, 2018. One-third of these stock options granted in fiscal year 2018 vested or will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, with another one-third scheduled to vest on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the final one-third scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The total number of non-executive Director stock options that vested during the fiscal year ending November 30, 2018 was 253,203, which represented 0.078% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares as of that date. Share-based awards (DSUs) granted to Gerald McConnell vested and were paid out in the form of 61,634 Common Shares during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. Share-based awards (DSUs) granted to Gillyeard Leathley vested and were paid out in the form of 36,526 Common Shares during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. Messrs. McConnell and Leathley retired from the Company's Board of Directors effective May 4, 2018 and July 5, 2018, respectively.

SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company has adopted the Stock Award Plan, the PSU Plan and the DSU Plan. The Company last asked for and received Shareholder approval of these plans at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 5, 2017. The intent of these equity plans is to allow the Company to provide a flexible mix of compensation components to attract, retain, and motivate the performance of the plan participants in alignment with the success of the Company and its Shareholders, to encourage share ownership by executive officers and Directors, and to preserve cash where possible. The Company feels that DSUs align Directors' interests to those of the Shareholders more effectively than other equity programs. These equity plans assist to further align the interests of executive officers and Directors with the long-term interests of Shareholders.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The Company currently grants equity under the Stock Award Plan, the PSU Plan, and the DSU Plan to attract and retain Directors, officers, employees, and Eligible Consultants to the Company and to motivate them to advance the Company's interests by affording them the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company through options and performance-based share awards.
The following table sets out information concerning the number and price of securities to be issued under equity compensation plans to employees and others. All of the compensation plans referenced below have been approved by Shareholders. The Company does not have any equity compensation plans which have not been approved by Shareholders.

General Information – Stock Based Incentive Plans
Stock Award Plan
Summary of Award Types
Under the Stock Award Plan, stock options ("options"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and tandem SARs ("Tandem SARs") may be granted to participants at any time as determined by the Board. The participant's Award agreement shall list the term of the Award, as determined by the Board, as well as the period during which the Award may be exercised. The term of a Tandem SAR may not exceed the term of the option portion of the Award, which may not exceed five years, and a free-standing SAR's term may not exceed five years, provided however, that if at any time the expiry of the term of an Award should be determined to occur either during a period in which the trading of Common Shares by the holder of the Award is restricted under the insider trading policy or other policy of the Company or within ten business days following such a period, such expiry date will be deemed to be the date that is the tenth business day following the date of expiry of such restriction. All Awards must be granted with an exercise price no less than "fair market value" of the Common Shares on the date of grant. Unless determined otherwise by the Board, fair market value is generally defined under the Stock Award Plan as the last recorded sale price of the Common Shares on the TSX (for Canadian resident participants) or the NYSE American (for non-Canadian resident participants) for the preceding trading date. All options granted under the Stock Award Plan are nonqualified stock options for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
A SAR may be granted in tandem with an option granted under the Stock Award Plan or on a free-standing basis and may be exercised upon such terms and conditions as the Board, in its sole discretion, determines. Upon exercise of a SAR, the participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of exercise over the price at which the SAR was originally granted (which shall not be less than the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of the SAR grant). All payments shall be made in Common Shares, the number of which shall be calculated by dividing the payment amount by the fair market value of the Common Shares on the exercise date.
Tandem SARs give the awardee the right to surrender to the Company all or a portion of the related option and to receive a distribution of Common Shares in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of shares as of the date the SAR is exercised over the exercise price of the related option. To the extent a Tandem SAR is exercised, the related option will terminate at the time of such exercise. The effect of the exercise of a SAR or Tandem SAR would be a reduction in the total number of shares issued by the Company to a participant versus the exercise of an equivalent stock option.
The total number of Common Shares that may be issued to an individual participant under the Stock Award Plan upon the exercise of Awards granted thereunder shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 5% of the Company's total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares at the date of grant of such Award. In addition, no individual participant may be granted any Award or Awards for more than ten million Common Shares in any calendar year. The maximum number of shares issuable to insiders pursuant to the Stock Award Plan, together with any shares issued pursuant to any other share compensation arrangement (i) at any time shall not exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares and (ii) within any one-year period, shall not exceed 10% of the total number of issued and outstanding Common Shares.
-76-
Administration
The Stock Award Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee appointed by the Board. Subject to the terms of the Stock Award Plan, the Compensation Committee may determine, among other things, the persons to whom Awards may be granted, the number of Awards to be granted to any participant, and the exercise price and the schedule and dates for vesting of Awards granted. The Compensation Committee may, but is not required to, impose a vesting schedule on any Award made under the Stock Award Plan.
If a participant ceases to be engaged by the Company for any reason other than death, they will have the right to exercise any vested Award not exercised prior to such termination within the lesser of six months from the date of the termination, unless otherwise extended by the Board, in its absolute discretion, or the expiry date of the Award; provided that if the termination is for just cause the right to exercise the vested Award shall terminate on the date of termination unless otherwise determined by the Board. The unvested portion of all Awards shall be forfeited on the date of termination.
The Board shall have the power to, at any time and from time to time, either prospectively or retrospectively, and without Shareholder approval, amend, suspend or terminate the Stock Award Plan or any Award granted under the Stock Award Plan, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, changes of a clerical or grammatical nature and changes regarding the vesting of Awards; provided, however, that:
(a)  such amendment, suspension or termination is in accordance with applicable laws and the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed;
(b)  no such amendment, suspension or termination shall be made at any time to the extent such action would materially adversely affect the existing rights of a participant with respect to any then outstanding Award, as determined by the Board acting in good faith, without their consent in writing; and
(c) the Board shall obtain Shareholder approval of the following:
In the event of, among other things, a take-over bid affecting the Company, the Board of the Company will notify each awardee under the Stock Award Plan of the full particulars of the offer whereupon all Awards will become vested and may be exercised.
Transferability
No Awards granted under the Stock Award Plan shall be transferable or assignable other than by will or by the laws of succession. However, if permitted by all applicable laws and the rules of the TSX or the NYSE American, as applicable, a participant may assign any Award to a trust or a similar legal entity.
Change of Control
The Board recently approved an amendment to the Stock Award Plan to require a double-trigger for accelerated vesting of Awards in the event of a change of control. With respect to grants made on or after January 23, 2019, if the employment of an awardee is terminated by the Company other than for cause or if the awardee resigns for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a change of control, all of the awardee's unvested Awards shall vest immediately prior to the awardee's date of termination.
-77-
For Awards granted prior to January 23, 2019, in the event of a change of control, all outstanding Awards will become vested, whereupon such Award may be exercised in whole or in part by the holder.
For purposes of the Stock Award Plan and Performance Share Unit Plan, a "change of control" means the acquisition by any person or by any person and a "joint actor," as defined in the Stock Award Plan, whether directly or indirectly, of voting securities, as defined in the Securities Act (British Columbia) of the Company, which, when added to all other voting securities of the Company at the time held by such person or by such person and a joint actor, totals for the first time not less than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or the votes attached to those securities are sufficient, if exercised, to elect a majority of the Board.
Burn Rate
The Stock Award Plan burn rate for each of the three most recently closed fiscal years is:
Performance Share Unit Plan
Vesting
The PSUs vest upon the expiry of a time-based vesting period. The duration of the vesting period applicable to a specific PSU grant shall be determined at the time of the grant by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee may establish other terms or conditions with respect to the vesting of PSUs, including without limitation, provisions which make the vesting of PSUs conditional upon (i) the achievement of corporate or personal objectives, including the attainment of milestones relating to financial, operational, strategic or other objectives of the Company, (ii) the market price of the Company's Common Shares from time to time and/or the return to Shareholders, and/or (iii) any other performance criteria relating to the participant or the Company. Any such conditions shall be set out in a grant agreement, may relate to all or any portion of the PSUs in a grant, and may be graduated such that different percentages of the PSUs in a grant will vest depending on the extent of satisfaction of one or more such conditions. The Board may, in its discretion and having regard to the best interests of the Company, subsequent to the grant date of a PSU, waive any such terms or conditions or determine that they have been satisfied.
Once the PSUs in a grant vest, the participant is entitled to receive the equivalent number of Common Shares or cash equal to the Market Value (as defined below) of the equivalent number of Common Shares. The vested PSUs may be settled through the issuance of Common Shares from treasury, by the delivery of Common Shares purchased in the open market, in cash or in any combination of the foregoing (at the discretion of the Company). If settled in cash, the award amount shall be equal to the number of Common Shares in respect of which the participant is entitled multiplied by the Market Value of a Common Share on the payout date. Market Value per share as of any date is defined in the PSU Plan (if the Common Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX and/or the NYSE American) as the arithmetic average of the closing price of the Common Shares traded on the TSX or the NYSE American for the five (5) trading days on which a board lot was traded immediately preceding such date. The PSUs may be settled on the payout date, which shall be the second or third anniversary of the date of the grant or such other date as the Compensation Committee may determine at the time of the grant, which in any event shall be no later than the expiry date for such PSUs. The expiry date of PSUs will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant. All unvested, expired or previously settled PSUs are available for future grants.
-78-
Cessation of Entitlement
Unless otherwise determined by the Company in accordance with the PSU Plan, PSUs which have not vested on a participant's termination date shall terminate and be forfeited. If a participant who is an employee ceases to be an employee as a result of termination of employment without cause, at the Company's discretion (unless otherwise provided in the applicable grant agreement), all or a portion of such participant's PSUs may be permitted to continue to vest, in accordance with their terms, during any statutory or common law severance period or any period of reasonable notice required by law or as otherwise may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. All forfeited PSUs are available for future grants.
Transferability
PSUs are not assignable or transferable by a participant other than by operation of law, except, if and on such terms as the Company may permit, to a spouse or minor children or grandchildren or a personal holding company or family trust controlled by the participant, the sole shareholders or beneficiaries of which, as the case may be, are any combination of the participant, the participant's spouse, minor children or minor grandchildren, and after the participant's lifetime shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the participant's designated beneficiary, on such terms and conditions as are appropriate for such transfers to be included in the class of transferees who may rely on a Form S-8 registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to sell Common Shares received pursuant to the PSUs.
Amendments to the PSU Plan
The PSU Plan provides that the Company may, without notice, at any time and from time to time, and without Shareholder approval, amend the PSU Plan or any provisions thereof in such manner as the Company, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate:
provided, however, that:
-79-
Change of Control 
The Board recently approved an amendment to the Performance Share Unit Plan to require a double-trigger for accelerated vesting of outstanding PSUs in the event of a change of control. With respect to grants made on or after January 23, 2019, if at any time within 12 months from the date of a change of control: (i) a participant's relationship with the Company is terminated by the Company other than for cause or (ii) a participant resigns for good reason, all outstanding PSUs held by such participant shall become vested and the payout date in connection with such participant's vested PSUs shall be accelerated to the date of such participant's termination or resignation for good reason and the Company shall issue Common Shares to such participants with respect to such vested PSUs in accordance with Sections 6 and 8 of the Performance Share Unit Plan; provided that in the event that any PSUs are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, then the vesting of such PSUs shall accelerate only to the extent that such performance-based vesting conditions have been satisfied and further provided that if a performance-based vesting condition is, in the Board's discretion, capable of being partially performed, then vesting shall be accelerated on a pro rata basis to reflect the degree to which the vesting condition has been satisfied, as determined by the Board.
For PSUs granted prior to January 23, 2019, all outstanding PSUs will become vested on any change of control and the payout date in connection with such vested PSUs will be accelerated to the date of such change of control.
"Change of control" has the same meaning under the Performance Share Unit Plan as under the Stock Award Plan.
Burn Rate
The Performance Share Unit Plan burn rate for each of the three most recently closed fiscal years is:

Deferred Share Unit Plan
Administration of Plan
The DSU Plan provides that non-executive Directors (each, a "Participant") will receive 50%, and may elect to receive up to 100%, of their annual compensation amount (the "Annual Base Compensation") in DSUs. The cash portion of Annual Base Compensation shall be paid to the Participant quarterly. A DSU is a unit credited to a Participant by way of a bookkeeping entry in the books of the Company, the value of which is equivalent to the value of one Common Share. All DSUs paid with respect to Annual Base Compensation will be credited quarterly to the Participant by means of an entry in a notional account in their favor on the books of the Company (a "DSU Account") when such Annual Base Compensation is payable. The Participant's DSU Account will be credited on a quarterly basis with the number of DSUs, calculated to the nearest thousandth of a DSU, determined by dividing the dollar amount of compensation payable in DSUs on the grant date by the Share Price of a Common Share at that time. Share Price is defined in the DSU Plan as (if the Common Shares are listed and posted for trading on the TSX and/or the NYSE American) the closing price of the Common Shares on the TSX or the NYSE American averaged over the last five (5) consecutive trading days of the fiscal quarter. Fractional Common Shares will not be issued and any fractional entitlements will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
Generally, a Participant in the DSU Plan shall be entitled to redeem their DSUs during the period commencing on the business day immediately following the date upon which the Participant ceases to hold any position as a Director of the Company and its subsidiaries and is no longer otherwise employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, including in the event of death of the Participant (the "Termination Date"), and ending on the 90th day following the Termination Date, provided, however that for eligible U.S. Participants, redemption will be made upon such Participant's "separation from service" as defined under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Redemptions under the DSU Plan may be settled in Common Shares issued from treasury, Common Shares purchased by the Company on the open market for delivery to the Participant, cash, or any combination of the foregoing, subject to the restrictions set forth in the DSU Plan.
Transferability
No right to receive payment of deferred compensation or retirement awards shall be transferable or assignable by any Participant under the DSU Plan except by will or laws of descent and distribution.
Amendments to the DSU Plan
The DSU Plan provides that the Board may at any time, and from time to time, and without Shareholder approval, amend any provision of the DSU Plan, subject to any regulatory or stock exchange requirement at the time of such amendment, including, without limitation:
provided, however, that:

INDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
As of November 30, 2018, and the date hereof, the aggregate indebtedness to the Company and its subsidiaries of all executive officers, Directors and employees, and their respective associates, and former executive officers, Directors and employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries was $nil.
INTEREST OF INFORMED PERSONS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS
No informed or related person of the Company, which includes each person who has been a Director or executive officer of the Company since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year, nor any proposed nominee for election as Director, nor any associate or affiliate of such informed person or proposed nominee, has had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction entered into by the Company since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year, or in any proposed transaction which has materially affected or would materially affect the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Generally speaking, under SEC rules, any transaction in which a related person has a material interest, other than transactions involving aggregate amounts less than $120,000, must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee. The policies apply to all executive officers, directors and their immediate family members. Since December 1, 2017, there were no related person transactions under the relevant standards. Please refer to the section titled "Ethical Business Conduct" beginning on page 89 of this Circular for a discussion about the Company's policies and procedures governing related party transactions.
STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
The Board is committed to sound corporate governance practices, which are both in the interest of Shareholders and contribute to effective and efficient decision making. As part of the Company's commitment to effective corporate governance, the Board, with the assistance of the Audit and Corporate Governance and Nominations Committees, monitors changes in legal requirements and best practices.

Post-Proxy Season Shareholder Engagement
Following the 2017 annual meeting of Shareholders, the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee (the "Chair") joined management and members of the Compensation Committee in a post-proxy season Shareholder engagement campaign. The Company invited its top 20 Shareholders to meet to discuss general corporate governance and executive compensation matters. The Chair, management and members of the Compensation Committee met with 12 of those Shareholders representing approximately 21.3% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares between May and October 2017. Some meetings were conducted in person and others were held telephonically. In 2018 we conducted another post-proxy season engagement campaign inviting the top 10 Shareholders we believed voted against the Company's executive compensation program proposal at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting to meet with Company management. We engaged with 6 of the 10 Shareholders: 4 by telephonic meeting and 2 through email exchanges. We undertook these enhanced engagement campaigns primarily in response to a lower than usual approval rate of the advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation program, but we also wanted to ensure that Shareholders had an opportunity to discuss and provide feedback on the Company's corporate governance programs with the Chair and members of management. Following the conclusion of each of these post-proxy season engagement campaigns, the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee analyzed the information received and made some recommendations for changes to the Board. The Board approved a number of changes to our corporate governance program in response to the feedback received from Shareholders.
A summary of the key feedback we received from Shareholders and our response to that feedback is contained in the following table:

[END TABLE]
Set out below is a description of certain corporate governance practices of the Company, as required by National Instrument 58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices ("NI 58-101") and National Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance Guidelines ("NP 58-201").
Board of Directors
The Company has a Board comprised of 10 Directors, led by Dr. Thomas Kaplan as Chairman and Anthony Walsh as independent Lead Director. The Board currently has 10 seats with one vacancy due to the unexpected retirement of Gillyeard Leathley on July 5, 2018, and the decision of Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse not to stand for election at the 2019 Meeting. Ethan Schutt has been nominated to serve as a new Director and fill one of the vacancies if Shareholders approve his election at the 2019 Meeting. In an effort to continue addressing concerns raised by Shareholders during the 2017 post-proxy season Shareholder engagement campaign described above, the Board elected to reduce its size from 11 seats to 10 seats, which was approved by Shareholders as of May 4, 2018. The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and Board will conduct an assessment of skills and experience needed for the Board and will conduct a search for a qualified individual to fill the remaining vacancy on the Board who has the necessary skills and experience in accordance with the charter of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee.
-84-
Dr. Kaplan is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Electrum Group, the investment adviser to the Company's largest shareholder, Electrum. The Board elected Dr. Kaplan as Chairman because of Electrum's significant ownership interest in the Company (26.00% as of March 18, 2019) as well as Dr. Kaplan's extensive experience as an entrepreneur, developer of and investor in public and private natural resources companies. As described below, to ensure independence in Board governance, the Board has appointed an independent Lead Director to coordinate discussion among the independent members of the Company's Board and to lead Board meetings if Dr. Kaplan is unavailable. Anthony Walsh currently serves as the Board's independent Lead Director.
NP 58-201 recommends that boards of directors of reporting issuers be composed of a majority of independent directors. With 7 of the 9 current Directors considered independent, the Board is currently composed of a majority of independent directors. The 7 independent Directors are: Sharon Dowdall, Diane Garrett, Igor Levental, Kalidas Madhavpeddi, Clynton Nauman, Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse and Anthony Walsh. If elected to serve on the Company's Board, Ethan Schutt will be considered an independent Director. Gregory Lang is the President and CEO of the Company and therefore deemed non-independent. Dr. Kaplan, the Chairman of the Board, is not considered to be independent as a result of his relationship to the Company's largest Shareholder.
The Company has taken steps to ensure that adequate structures and processes are in place to permit the Board to function independently of management. The Board holds regular meetings every quarter. Between the scheduled meetings, the Board meets as required. The independent Directors are afforded an opportunity to meet separately from the non-independent Directors and any representatives of management at every Board meeting. The independent Directors meet in camera at least annually and on an as-needed basis. During fiscal year 2018, the independent Directors met six times. Management also communicates informally with the Directors on a regular basis and solicits advice from members or advisors on matters falling within their areas of special knowledge or experience.
The Board has five standing subcommittees: Audit, Compensation, Corporate Communications, Corporate Governance and Nominations, and EHSS and Technical. Each of the foregoing subcommittees has its own charter, copies of which are available on the Company's website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab. Special committees are appointed from time to time with respect to specific matters.
The Board and its standing subcommittees meet regularly outside the presence of Company management to engage in open discussion about Company strategy, management's performance, and any items of special concern or note that may impact the Company. Depending upon the topic, the Board or its standing subcommittees may meet with experts of their choosing, such as the Compensation Consultant, the Company's Auditors or outside legal counsel, for example, outside the presence of management. The Board believes this practice of meeting without Company management from time to time results in frank discussions, assessments and the effective oversight of risks and opportunities facing the Company.

The following Directors and Director nominees currently serve on the following boards of directors of other reporting issuers:

[END TABLE]
*The Board has waived compliance with the Company's Board Service Policy for Dr. Diane Garrett until the end of calendar year 2019 to allow her time to make arrangements to come into compliance.
Independence of Directors 
The Board determined that the following Directors qualify as independent under the applicable Board and committee standards of the NYSE American, SEC rules and National Instrument 58-101: Ms. Dowdall, Dr. Garrett, Messrs. Levental, Madhavpeddi, Nauman, Van Nieuwenhuyse and Walsh. Dr. Kaplan is not considered to be independent because he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Electrum Group, which manages the portfolio of Electrum, the largest Shareholder of the Company. Mr. Lang is not considered to be independent because he is the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Ethan Schutt will be considered an independent Director if his election to the Board is approved by the Shareholders at the Meeting.
Board Mandate
The Board is responsible for the overall stewardship of the Company. The Board discharges this responsibility directly and through the delegation of specific responsibilities to committees of the Board. The Board works with management to establish the goals and strategies of the Company, to identify principal risks, to select and assess senior management and to review significant operational and financial matters. The Board does not have a written mandate. The Board delineates its role and responsibilities based on the statutory and common law applicable to the Company.
-86-
The Board has appointed an Audit Committee to assist the Board in monitoring (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, (iii) the performance of the Company's internal financial controls and audit function and the independent auditors, and (iv) compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. The members of the Audit Committee are appointed annually by the Board following the annual general meeting of shareholders. The members of the Audit Committee are required to meet the independence and experience requirements of the NYSE American and Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC. At least one member of the Audit Committee is required to be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The Company's Audit Committee consists of fully independent members and the Company's "audit committee financial expert" is Anthony Walsh. The Audit Committee meetings are held quarterly at a minimum. The Audit Committee met four times in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Position Descriptions
The position descriptions for the chairs of each Board committee are contained in the committee charters. The chair of each of the following committees: Audit, Compensation, Corporate Communications, Corporate Governance and Nominations, and EHSS and Technical, is required to ensure the Committee meets regularly and performs the duties as set forth in its charter, and reports to the Board on the activities of the Committee. The Board has developed a written position description for the Chair of the Board and this position is presently held by Dr. Thomas Kaplan. The Chair of the Board is principally responsible for overseeing the operations and affairs of the Board.
The Board has also developed a written position description for the CEO. The CEO is primarily responsible for the overall management of the business and affairs of the Company. In this capacity, the CEO shall establish the strategic and operational priorities of the Company and provide leadership to the management team. The CEO is directly responsible to the Board for all the Company's activities.
Orientation and Continuing Education
The Company provides an orientation and education program to new directors. This program consists of providing education regarding directors' responsibilities, corporate governance issues, committee charters as well as recent and developing issues related to corporate governance and regulatory reporting. The Company provides orientation in matters material to the Company's business and in areas outside of the specific expertise of the Board members. All new members of the Board have historically been experienced in the mining sector or in resource development; therefore, general orientation about mining or resource development has not been necessary.
Continuing education helps Directors keep up to date on changing governance issues as well as requirements and legislation or regulations in their field of experience. The Board recognizes the importance of ongoing education for the Directors and senior management of the Company and the need for each Director and officer to take personal responsibility for this process. To facilitate ongoing education, the CEO or the Board may from time to time, as required:
During fiscal year 2018, Directors participated in educational sessions and received educational materials on the topics outlined below.

In addition, the Board encourages senior management to participate in professional development programs and courses and supports management's commitment to training and developing employees.

Ethical Business Conduct
The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Ethics Code") for the Company's Directors, officers and employees. The Ethics Code is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, on the Company's website at www.novagold.com under the Governance tab, or may be obtained by contacting the Company at the address given under "Additional Information" at the end of this Circular.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the Ethics Code. The Board has delegated this compliance monitoring responsibility to the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee which, among other things, reviews the Ethics Code periodically. The Board has delegated the responsibility of monitoring complaints regarding accounting, internal controls, cybersecurity matters, or auditing matters to the Audit Committee. Monitoring of accounting, internal control, cybersecurity and auditing matters, as well as violations of the law, the Ethics Code and other Company policies or directives, occurs through the Board's and the Committees' regular oversight of the Company's operations. In addition, the Company maintains an independent, anonymous whistleblower hotline which is accessible by telephone, email or internet to which complaints or concerns may be reported. Concerns or questions regarding the Ethics Code may also be raised directly with the Company's outside counsel. The Company's Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud Policy (the "Policy"), also available on the Company's website at www.novagold.com under the Governance tab, establishes Formal Reporting Channels for Directors, officers, employees and agents to report suspected Policy violations or concerns related to the implementation of the Policy and mandates use of the Formal Reporting Channels in the event of specified circumstances. The Company commits to conduct appropriate, fair and thorough investigations of all concerns raised and to not tolerate retaliatory action against any individual for reporting, in good faith, concerns regarding known or suspected violations of any of the Company's policies.
Certain Company Directors serve as directors or officers of other reporting issuers or have significant shareholdings in other companies. To the extent that such other companies may participate in business ventures in which the Company may participate, the Directors may have a conflict of interest in negotiating and concluding terms respecting the extent of such participation. The Ethics Code explicitly addresses such situations and provides that a Director who is in a position where his or her private interests conflict with the interests of NOVAGOLD or may have an adverse effect on the Director's motivation or the proper performance of his or her job must notify the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of the existence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. In the event that such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the Board, the Director who has such a conflict is obligated to disclose the interest and to refrain from discussing and from voting for or against the approval of such matter. Any Director who may have an interest in a transaction or agreement with the Company is required to disclose such interest and abstain from discussions and voting in respect to same if the interest is material as required by the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). In considering related party transactions, the Board, and management, if applicable, will assess the materiality of related party transactions on a case-by-case basis with respect to both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the proposed related party transaction. Company officers and employees are similarly required by the Ethics Code to disclose all actual or potential conflicts of interest and to protect the Company's confidential information and business opportunities. Related party transactions that are in the normal course are subject to the same processes and controls as other transactions; that is, they are subject to standard approval procedures and management oversight but will also be considered by management for reasonability against fair value determined on an arms-length basis. Related party transactions that are found to be material are subject to review and approval by the Company's Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent Directors.
Nomination of Directors
The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee"), which met seven times during fiscal 2018, advises and makes recommendations to the Board on recruitment and nomination of members to the Board. On an annual basis, the Committee assesses the appropriate size of the Board with a view to determining the impact of the number of directors and the effectiveness of the Board, and recommending to the Board, if necessary, a reduction or increase in the size of the Board. Annually or as required, the Committee recruits and identifies potential candidates and considers their appropriateness for membership on the Board. The Committee is responsible for reviewing any Shareholder proposals to nominate candidates for Director. Shareholders may submit names of persons to be considered for nomination, and the Committee will consider such persons in the same way it evaluates other individuals for nomination as a new Director. For the Company's policies regarding Shareholder requests for nominations, see the section entitled "Shareholder Proposals" in this Circular. None of the current nominees were nominated by a Shareholder. The Committee abides by a diversity policy contained in the Committee's Charter aimed at selecting nominees to the Board with a variety of personal qualities, relevant experience, educational achievement, ethnicity, age, gender and cultural backgrounds. It is the job of the Committee to ensure that the background and skills of the Directors align with the Company's strategic direction. The Committee's Charter is available on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab. All members of the Committee are independent Directors. The Company aims to have a well-rounded Board that will guide the organization's strategy on economic, environmental and societal topics of highest relevance during the current and future lifecycle of its operations.

Board Diversity and Tenure
In 2014, the securities regulatory authorities of all but two of Canada's provinces and territories announced final amendments to National Instrument 58-101 Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices ("NI 58-101") and Form 58-101F1 Corporate Governance Disclosure, which came into effect on December 31, 2014. The amendments adopt a "comply or explain" disclosure model regarding director term limits and the representation of women on boards and in executive officer positions which require TSX-listed issuers to annually disclose in their proxy circular or annual information form (or provide an explanation for the absence of) the following:
The disclosure requirements of the amended NI 58-101 are applicable to disclosure documents which are filed following an issuer's financial year ending on or after December 31, 2014.
Board Renewal
The topic of director term limits was discussed by both the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") and the Board. The Board has not adopted any director term limits. With regard to the nomination of directors, the Board notes that the Committee's Charter mandates that the Committee annually "develop and update a long-term plan for the composition of the Board . . . and report to the Board thereon." This process shall include a "review [of] the desired experience, mix of skills and other qualities to assure appropriate Board composition, taking into account the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board." Included among the criteria to be considered by the Committee in this annual evaluation is the "length of service and potential retirement" of current Directors.
In addition, the Committee regularly conducts a Board self-assessment process with the assistance of outside legal counsel which provides each Director with the opportunity to assess how the Board is functioning and to make suggestions for improvements. The assessment process expressly addresses the organization and management of the Board, including its overall composition as well as the composition of each committee; the conduct of Board meetings, including management's preparation for and participation in those meetings; the clarity and appropriateness of each Board committee's charter; the performance of the Board with respect to a broad range of functions, including appointment and oversight of management, development and implementation of the Company's business strategies, risk management, and regulatory reporting compliance; and Board compensation. The most recent of these assessments was completed in November 2018, and the Board discussed the results of the assessment at its November 2018 meeting to determine what action, if any, could further enhance the operations of the Board and its committees.
-90-
The Board is committed to regular evaluations of its composition, organization, operations, and effectiveness. The Board concluded that these governance processes are a more appropriate manner in which to ensure proper Board composition and function than adopting a mandatory tenure or retirement age policy.
What changed in 2018? During the summer of 2017, the Chair of the Committee met with many of the Company's largest institutional shareholders, who expressed an interest in seeing the Company reduce the size of the Board, increase Board diversity, and implement some board renewal as five years had passed without any change in Directors. In response, the Committee recommended, and the Board agreed: i) not to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Marc Faber in October 2017, ii) to accept Gerald McConnell's decision not to stand for election at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting, iii) to fix its size at ten, down from eleven seats, and iv) to nominate Dr. Diane Garrett as a new director for Shareholder approval at the 2018 annual shareholder meeting. Additionally, the Committee and Board agreed to continue to evaluate the Board's composition and tenure of its members as further renewal was considered.
What is changing in 2019? During fiscal year 2018, the Committee and Board continued to consider additional Board renewal. In July 2018, Mr. Leathley announced his retirement from the Board, and in late 2018 Mr. Van Nieuwenhuyse and the Committee began discussing his not standing for election to the Board at the 2019 Meeting. At the request of the Board, the Committee conducted a search focused on candidates with significant experience working with Alaska Native communities, and familiarity with the Alaska business community and political landscape. At the conclusion of the candidate search, evaluation and interview process, the Board approved Ethan Schutt as a nominee for election to the Board at the 2019 Meeting.
Board and Company Diversity
At present two of the Company's nine Directors, or 22% of the Company's Directors, are female. Both of the Company's current female Directors are included in the slate of nine Director nominees presented to Shareholders at the 2019 Meeting. One of the five Company executives at the level of Vice President and above, or 20% of Company executives, is female. Overall, of the Company's 12 employees as of March 18, 2019, six, or 50%, are women. The Company's written policies regarding the representation of women on the Board and the Committee's consideration of the representation of women in the Director identification and selection process are described below. For the reasons explained, the Board and the Committee determined not to adopt specific representation targets for women at Board or executive levels.
The Committee's Charter mandates that the Committee consider the following attributes of candidates for the Board: "(1) relevant knowledge and experience in areas including mining, business, finance, accounting, international business, government, and technology; (2) personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and whether the candidate possesses a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect, competence and adherence to the highest ethical standards; (3) diversity in ethnicity, gender, age, and cultural background; and (4) whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation and attendance at meetings." (Emphasis added.) The importance of diversity is incorporated in the Committee's annual assessment of the long-term plan for the composition of the Board that considers: "the current strengths, competencies, skills and experience of the Board members; diversity in experience, ethnicity, gender, age, and cultural background; length of service and potential retirement; dates and the strategic direction of the Company." (Emphasis added.)
After discussion of the amendments to NI 58-101, in January 2015 the Board adopted an amendment to the Committee's Charter which provides:
Consistent with the objective of ensuring gender diversity, for every open Board position at least one-half of the candidates recommended by the Committee for consideration by the Board shall be female. 
-91-
The Board believes that these written policies with regard to gender diversity on the Board are consistent with its objective of ensuring that the Board comprises the necessary range of background, experience, values and perspectives to optimize the Company's opportunities for success. The additional commitment to recommending at least 50% female candidates for Board consideration in the ongoing process of refreshing the Board will ensure that a sufficiently gender diverse list of potential candidates is considered without compromising the Board's fundamental commitment to make an objective assessment of who is the best person to fill a vacancy on the Board. Accordingly, the Board determined not to set targets for the percentage of women, or other aspects of diversity, on the Board.
Empowering every employee to be their best, affording every employee the opportunity to make a difference, and giving every employee a chance to be heard are core Company values. Selection of individuals for executive and other positions with the Company is guided by the Company's policy which "prohibits discrimination in any aspect of employment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or age." The Company's Board and management acknowledge the importance of all aspects of diversity including gender, ethnic origin, business skills and experience, because it is right to do so and because it is good for our business. When considering candidates for executive positions, the Board's evaluation takes into account the broadest possible assessment of each candidate's skills and background with the overriding objective of ensuring that the Company has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, and capacity that the Company needs to be successful. In the context of this overriding objective, the Company has determined not to set targets for the percentage of women, or other aspects of diversity, in executive officer positions.
The following chart summarizes the skills, experience and demographic diversity of the slate of Directors presented to the Shareholders for approval at the 2019 Meeting.

Board Service Policy
In response to concerns raised by some Shareholders during the post-proxy season engagement campaign held following the 2017 Meeting, the Board adopted a policy in January 2018 to limit the number of outside public company boards on which Company directors may serve. The Board Service Policy provides that Company directors who serve as the CEO of a public company may serve only on NOVAGOLD's Board and on one other public company board (presumably the board of the company where they serve as CEO). Company Directors who do not serve as the CEO of a public company may serve on no more than four public company boards in addition to serving on NOVAGOLD's Board. The Board made the Board Service Policy immediately applicable to future Directors but implemented a transition period for compliance by incumbent Directors until the Company's 2019 annual meeting of Shareholders. The Board Service Policy allows the Governance and Nominations Committee to consider whether there are factors related to an incumbent Director's or candidate's other board or executive obligations that warrant a waiver of the limitations established by the Board Service Policy. Any such waiver must be approved by the Board. The Board has waived compliance with the Company's Board Service Policy for Dr. Diane Garrett until the end of calendar year 2019 to allow her time to make arrangements to come into compliance. Dr. Garrett is the CEO and a director of Nickel Creek Platinum and serves on the boards of Revival Gold and of the Company. A copy of the Board Service Policy can be found on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Insider Trading Policy
The Board has adopted an Insider Trading Policy applicable to all Directors and employees. The Insider Trading Policy prohibits Directors and employees from trading in the Company's securities during blackout periods and while in possession of material, non-public information about the Company. It also discusses requirements applicable to Directors and certain officers regarding obligations to report their transactions in the Company's securities. A copy of the Insider Trading Policy can be found on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud Policy
The Company is committed to protecting its reputation, revenues, assets and information from corruption, bribery, fraud, deceit or other improper conduct by directors, officers, employees or agents. The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (described in the section titled "Ethical Business Conduct" above) which embodies NOVAGOLD's commitment to conduct its business in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and the highest ethical standards. The newly adopted Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud Policy sets out NOVAGOLD's expectations and requirements relating to the prohibition, recognition, reporting, and investigation of suspected corruption, bribery, fraud, deceit, or other improper conduct. A copy of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Anti-Fraud Policy is available on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Executive Compensation Clawback Policy
In response to concerns about the lack of a Company clawback policy raised by some shareholders during the post-proxy season engagement campaign held following the 2017 Meeting, the Board adopted an Executive Compensation Clawback Policy in November 2017. The policy states that in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, at the Board's direction, the Company will seek to recover any incentive compensation awarded or paid to an NEO for a fiscal year if the result of a performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment. Prior to the adoption of this policy, the Company was waiting for the SEC to issue a final clawback rule before it adopted a clawback policy; however, the SEC has not issued, and appears unlikely to issue, a final rule anytime soon. Therefore, the Company opted to adopt a policy in response to shareholder concerns. A copy of the Executive Compensation Clawback Policy can be found on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.

Human Rights Policy
NOVAGOLD is committed to having a positive influence in the communities where we operate, which includes ensuring that we respect human rights. Accordingly, the Board recently adopted a Human Rights Policy. The policy acknowledges that the primary duty to protect and secure human rights rests with government. NOVAGOLD accepts and embraces the duty of business to respect human rights as defined in Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. NOVAGOLD has identified seven areas of salient human rights risks associated with our business activities and relationships. NOVAGOLD identified these risks based on management's experience in the gold mining industry, through engagement with stakeholders potentially affected by our operations, and through interaction with the Native Alaskan people who own, occupy, or use the lands on which our Donlin Gold project is located and lands that may otherwise be impacted by the project. A complete copy of the Human Rights Policy is available on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
NOVAGOLD recognizes the importance of considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as we develop the Donlin Gold project in conjunction with Barrick, Donlin Gold LLC, Calista and TKC, and as we operate the Company on a day-to-day basis for the benefit of our Shareholders and our employees. In addition to other items described in this Circular, below are some of the actions the Company is taking to meet these commitments:
-94-
Corporate Disclosure Policy
NOVAGOLD is committed to providing fair and equal access to information that may affect the investment decisions of security holders and the public. The goal of the Corporate Disclosure Policy is to raise awareness of the Company's approach to disclosure, to promote compliance among the Board, management, employees, consultants and any other insiders, and to ensure that NOVAGOLD's disclosure practices remain consistent at all levels. The Corporate Disclosure Policy was adopted to ensure that all communications to shareholders and the investing public about the Company and its subsidiaries are: a) complete, factual, accurate and timely, and b) broadly disseminated in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
In 2018, the Board approved an update to the policy, which most notably includes a new section that provides a framework for Board member engagement with Company security holders. A copy of the Corporate Disclosure Policy can be found on the Company website at: www.novagold.com under the Governance tab.
Other Board Committees
In addition to the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee, the Board also has the EHSS and Technical Committee and the Corporate Communications Committee. The EHSS and Technical Committee's objective is to provide oversight for the development, implementation and monitoring of the Company's health, safety, environment and sustainability policies. The Corporate Communications Committee has general responsibility for all regulatory disclosure requirements and for overseeing the Company's disclosure practices in accordance with its Corporate Disclosure Policy and shall, together with management, be primarily responsible for the preparation of all press releases, investor presentations and other corporate communication materials.
Assessments
The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee, with the assistance of outside counsel, circulates a Board assessment questionnaire to all Directors requesting information about the effectiveness of the Board and each committee, as well as about the interaction between the Board and Company management. The assessment expressly addresses the organization and management of the Board, including its overall composition as well as the composition of each committee; the conduct of Board meetings, including management's preparation for and participation in those meetings; the clarity and appropriateness of each Board committee's charter; the performance of the Board with respect to a broad range of functions, including appointment and oversight of management, development and implementation of the Company's business strategies, risk management, and regulatory reporting compliance; and Board compensation. The questionnaire also requests evaluation of the competencies and skills each Director is expected to bring to his or her particular role on the Board or on a committee, as well as any other relevant facts. Completed assessment questionnaires are returned to outside counsel to the Company to protect the anonymity of the responder, thus encouraging honest and open responses. Outside counsel presents a summary of the questionnaire responses to the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee Chair, and then presents the summary to the Board and management as appropriate. The most recent Board assessment was completed in November 2018.
The Board is responsible for selecting and appointing executive officers and senior management and for monitoring their performance. The performance of senior management is measured annually against pre-set objectives. The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of a process for assessing the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and its members.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, and to be included in the Company's proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, must be received by us at our office in Vancouver, British Columbia by no later than November 30, 2019, which is approximately 120 calendar days before the anniversary date on which our Circular was released to Shareholders in connection with this year's annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, if such proposals are to be considered timely. If the date of the next annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of this year's annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, then the deadline to submit a proposal to be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy circular and form of proxy, is a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail proxy circular materials. The inclusion of any shareholder proposal in the proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company will be subject to the applicable rules of the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The Company's Articles do not provide a method for a shareholder to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 annual general meeting of the Shareholders. However, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the "BCBCA"), in Part 5, Division 7, "Shareholder Proposals", sets forth the procedure by which a person who:
may submit a written notice setting out a matter that the submitter wishes to have considered at the next annual general meeting of the Company (a "proposal").  
The BCBCA also sets out the requirements for a valid proposal and provides for the rights and obligations of the Company and the submitter upon a valid proposal being made. In general, for a proposal to be valid, it must be:
HOUSEHOLDING
The SEC's rules permit the Company to deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more Shareholders. This practice, known as "householding," is intended to reduce the Company's printing and postage costs. The Company has delivered only one set of proxy materials to shareholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record and share a single address, unless the Company has received contrary instructions from any Shareholder at that address. However, any such street name holder residing at the same address who wishes to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials may make such a request by contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record, or Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at (800) 542-1061 or in writing at Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Street name holders residing at the same address who would like to request householding of Company materials may do so by contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record or Broadridge at the phone number or address listed above.
