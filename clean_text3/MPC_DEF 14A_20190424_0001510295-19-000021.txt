Dear Fellow Marathon Petroleum Corporation Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board of Directors and management team, I am pleased to invite you to attend Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held in the Auditorium of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840 on Wednesday, April 24, 2019, at 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. 
Your company delivered strong operational and financial performance in 2018. We also completed our transformative combination with Andeavor in October 2018, creating the largest downstream energy company in the United States. The combined legacies of these two great companies have enhanced the benefits of our integrated business model, providing unprecedented opportunities. Our nationwide footprint and broader market presence give us additional access to price-advantaged feedstocks and create new product-placement options. Our expanded logistics system lowers our crude oil acquisition costs and increases our speed to market. Over the first three months following the combination, we realized recurring and non-recurring synergies of $160 million.
Since the company's formation in 2011, we have consistently returned capital to our shareholders beyond the needs of the business. During 2018, we returned a total of $4.2 billion to shareholders, including $3.3 billion in share repurchases. In addition, the Board of Directors announced in January a 15 percent increase in our quarterly dividend, following a 15 percent increase in 2018 and an 11 percent increase in 2017. This represents a 25 percent compound annual growth rate in our dividend over the past eight years since our formation, demonstrating continued confidence in the cash-flow generation of the business. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Our operational and financial successes are primarily driven by our thousands of talented employees and the values that define how we conduct our important work. As  we provide the fuels and other products that people rely on to make their lives better every day, we never lose sight of our core values of health and safety, environmental stewardship, integrity, corporate citizenship and an inclusive culture. Our commitment to these values in all we do helps ensure our license to operate.  
We believe that our steadfast commitment to high ethical standards and strong corporate governance benefits all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, customers, communities and the environment. This Proxy Statement provides you information regarding our corporate governance policies and practices, as well as other information you need to make informed decisions about the matters on which you are being asked to vote. I encourage you to read it and exercise your right to vote your ownership stake. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I thank you again for your investment in Marathon Petroleum Corporation, and for participating in our success. We hope to see you in Findlay. 
Sincerely, 
 Gary R. Heminger
 Gary R. Heminger
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

We also believe good governance is critical to achieving long-term shareholder value. We approach governance in a strategic and thoughtful manner, taking into consideration multiple perspectives, including those of our Board, our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, management, experts and stakeholders, to align on what makes the most sense for our Company. We continuously look for ways to enhance our corporate governance and increase value to our shareholders. 
For example, in February 2016, the Board proactively adopted "proxy access," allowing a shareholder, or group of 20 or fewer shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two directors or 20% of the number of directors serving on the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. The Board's decision followed a careful evaluation over several meetings of shareholder views, evolving practices, relevant academic research, the potential impact on the Company and proxy access frameworks adopted by other companies.
In January 2018, the Board adopted an amendment to our Bylaws allowing shareholders owning in the aggregate 25% of our outstanding common stock and complying with other requirements set forth in our Bylaws the right to request that the Company call a special meeting of shareholders. The Board believes the 25% ownership threshold 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   1 
[END TABLE]
strikes the appropriate balance between allowing shareholders to vote on important matters that may arise between annual meetings and protecting against the risk that a single shareholder or small group of shareholders could call a special meeting that serves only a narrow agenda. This 25% ownership threshold is a common threshold among large public companies offering shareholders this right and helps protect shareholder rights without the expense and risk associated with a lower special meeting threshold. 
In May 2018, the Board adopted an amendment to our Bylaws eliminating the supermajority requirement for Bylaw amendments. Prior to this amendment, any Bylaw amendment not supported by our directors had to receive the affirmative vote of at least 80% of all outstanding shares of our common stock for such amendment to be approved. Following this amendment, any Bylaw amendment not supported by our directors must receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of our common stock for such amendment to be approved.
Governance Framework 
Our Corporate Governance Principles, our Bylaws and the charters of our Board committees together implement the governance principles we believe are best for our stakeholders and provide the framework for our governance processes. They address, among other things, the primary roles, responsibilities and oversight functions of the Board and its committees, director independence, committee composition, the lead director role, the process for director selection and director qualifications, director indemnification and shareholder rights, including the right to call a special meeting and proxy access, director compensation and director retirement and resignation.
We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that is specifically applicable to the CEO, the CFO, the Controller, the Treasurer and persons performing similar functions, as well as to those designated as Senior Financial Officers by our Chairman and CEO or our Audit Committee. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. Copies of these documents are available on our website and printed copies are also available upon request to our Corporate Secretary. We will post on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, either of our Codes requiring disclosure under applicable rules within four business days following the amendment or waiver.
Our Whistleblowing as to Accounting Matters Policy establishes procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Company or others of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. 
Copies of the Corporate Governance Principles, our Bylaws, the Board committee charters, the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, the Code of Business Conduct and the Whistleblowing as to Accounting Matters Policy are available on our website at www.marathonpetroleum.com under the heading "Investors" and the subheading "Corporate Governance." 
The Board of Directors 
The Board oversees the management of our business and affairs. The Board is divided into three classes, each currently comprised of four directors. Shareholders elect each class of directors for a term of three years. The terms for the directors currently in Classes I, II and III of the Board expire in 2021, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Effective October 1, 2018, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement whereby we acquired Andeavor, Edward G. Galante, Gregory J. Goff, Kim K.W. Rucker and Susan Tomasky were elected to the Board. Upon such elections and pursuant to the merger agreement, Donna A. James and Frank M. Semple resigned as members of the Board. Ms. James serves as a board advisor and is expected to attend, in a non-voting capacity, certain meetings of the Board and its committees. Mr. Semple will continue to serve on the board of directors of the general partner of MPLX, and was elected to serve on the board of directors of the general partner of ANDX. In his capacity as a director of MPLX and ANDX, Mr. Semple serves as a board observer and is expected to attend, in a non-voting capacity, certain meetings of the MPC Board and its committees.
The Board met 11 times in 2018. The attendance of the members of our Board averaged approximately 95% for the aggregate of the total number of Board and committee meetings held in 2018. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served, except for Ms. James, who due to receiving treatment for a health issue, attended 78% of the Board meetings but fewer than 75% of the combined total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which she served. Our Corporate Governance 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Principles provide that the non-employee directors of the Board will hold regular executive sessions presided over by the Lead Director. The non-employee directors held nine executive sessions in 2018.
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. All members of the Board other than Ms. James attended the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 25, 2018.
Our directors represent a balance of critical skills, qualifications and attributes to the Board, only some of which are summarized in the following table.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Senior Leadership Experience                         12 Directors

Specific information about the key qualifications and experience of each director can be found beginning on page 15 under "Proposal 1. Election of Directors."  
[END TABLE]
Director Identification and Selection 
The Board believes that it, as a whole, should possess a combination of skills, professional experience, and diversity of backgrounds and perspectives necessary to oversee our business. Accordingly, the Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and our current and future needs. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also develops and maintains a long-term plan for Board composition that takes into consideration the current strengths, skills and experience on the Board, our director retirement policy and our strategic direction.
Process 
Our Corporate Governance Principles set forth the processes for director selection and the establishment of director qualifications. The Board has delegated the director selection process to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee with input from our Chairman and CEO and Lead Director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers from time to time suitable candidates for membership on the Board, including candidates recommended by shareholders. Shareholder candidates will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria for director selection described herein. Shareholders who wish to nominate a director at an annual meeting in accordance with our Bylaws should follow the instructions described under "Questions and Answers About the Annual Meeting." Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may work with a third-party professional search firm to review director candidates and their credentials. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's charter gives the Committee the authority to retain and terminate any search firm used to identify director candidates, including the authority to approve the search firm's fees and other retention terms.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   3 
[END TABLE]
Key Qualifications and Experience
In evaluating director candidates, and considering incumbent directors for renomination, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers a variety of factors, including each nominee's independence, personal and professional accomplishments, integrity and judgment, record of public service and ability to devote sufficient time to our affairs. For incumbent directors, the factors also include preparedness and past performance on the Board. In addition to these fundamental considerations, the Board believes it is beneficial to include individuals with the following skills and experiences on the Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior leadership experience, as directors with experience in significant leadership positions possess strong abilities to motivate and manage others and to identify and develop leadership qualities in others. 
• Financial expertise, particularly knowledge of finance and financial reporting processes, which is relevant to understanding and evaluating our capital structure and overseeing the preparation of our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. 
• Industry expertise, particularly in the areas of oil refining, logistics operations and retail sales, which is integral to understanding our business and strategy.  
• Strategic planning experience, which is relevant to the Board's review of our strategies and monitoring their implementation and results. 
• Risk management experience, which is critical to the Board's oversight of our risk assessment and risk management programs. 
• Operations experience, as it gives directors a practical understanding of developing, implementing and addressing our business strategy and development plan. 
• Legal experience, which guides oversight of our legal and compliance matters. 
• Government/regulatory experience, as we operate in a heavily regulated industry that is directly affected by governmental requirements. 
• Public company board service, as directors who have served on other public company boards have experience overseeing and providing insight and guidance to management. 
Specific information about the key qualifications and experience of each director can be found beginning on page 15 under "Proposal 1. Election of Directors."  
[END TABLE]
Board Diversity 
In January 2018, the Board amended our Corporate Governance Principles to expressly affirm its commitment to actively seek in its director selection efforts women candidates and candidates of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds who possess the skills and characteristics identified within our Corporate Governance Principles. This express commitment is in addition to the emphasis on a diversity of director backgrounds and experiences already found within our Corporate Governance Principles. 
Our directors exhibit an effective mix of diversity, experience and fresh perspective:

INDEPENDENT   AVERAGE TENURE   AVERAGE AGE   DIVERSE 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Director Independence 
The Board of Directors currently consists of 12 members, 10 of whom are independent. To determine director independence, the Board considers the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), the categorical standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles and the materiality of any relationship between a director and the Company. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances including, without limitation, transactions between us and the director directly, immediate family members of the director or organizations with which the director is affiliated, any service by the director on the board of a company with which we conduct business, and the frequency and dollar amounts associated with these transactions. The Board further considers whether such transactions are at arm's length in the ordinary course of business and whether any such transactions are consummated on terms and conditions similar to those with unrelated parties. 
In assessing the independence of each director who served on the Board during 2018, the Board affirmatively determined that each of the following directors meets the independence standards in our Corporate Governance Principles, has no material relationship with us other than as a director, and satisfies the independence requirements of the NYSE and applicable SEC rules:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Abdulaziz F. Alkhayyal Steven A. Davis Kim K.W. Rucker 
Evan Bayh Edward G. Galante J. Michael Stice 
Charles E. Bunch Donna A. James (former director) John P. Surma 
David A. Daberko (former director) James E. Rohr Susan Tomasky 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Heminger, who serves as our CEO, Mr. Goff, who serves as our Executive Vice Chairman, and Mr. Semple (former director), who previously served as Vice Chairman of MPLX GP, are not considered to be independent.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide the Board with the flexibility to exercise its business judgment on behalf of shareholders and choose the optimal leadership for the Board depending upon the Company's particular needs and circumstances. The independent members of the Board elect the Chairman and review whether to combine or separate the roles of Chairman and CEO. In 2018, the independent directors of the Board elected      Mr. Heminger to serve as Chairman. The Board has determined that Mr. Heminger is in the best position at this time to serve as Chairman due to his unique and in-depth knowledge of the history and growth of our Company, coupled with his industry expertise in key areas of strategic importance to our business. 
When the CEO is elected Chairman, the independent directors may elect a Lead Director from among themselves, whose responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presiding over all meetings of the Board in the Chairman/CEO's absence, including executive sessions; 
• Serving as a liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors; 
• Consulting with the Chairman/CEO on and approving meeting agendas, schedules and information sent to the Board; 
• Having the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; 
• Providing leadership to the Board in any situation where the Chairman and CEO roles may be perceived to be in conflict; and 
• Directly communicating with significant shareholders, as appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the independent directors of the Board elected Mr. Rohr to serve as Lead Director. The Board believes that this leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at this time because it strikes an effective balance between management and independent director participation in the Board process.

Risk Oversight 
Role of Management
Our senior management team has developed a strong enterprise risk management ("ERM") process for identifying, assessing and managing risk. Our ERM process is sponsored by our Chairman and CEO and our Senior Vice President and CFO, led by our enterprise risk manager, and supported by officers and senior managers responsible for working across the business to manage enterprise level risks and identify emerging risks. These leaders meet routinely and provide regular updates to our Board and its committees throughout the year.
Our mature company practices, developed through our ERM process, promote effective decision-making, including with regard to environmental, social and reputational risks. Our ERM process continually identifies, evaluates and monitors social, political and environmental trends, issues and concerns that could affect MPC's business activities and performance. These are all considerations in strategy setting, business planning and risk management. 
Role of the Board
While senior management has primary responsibility for managing risk, the Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. The Board and executive leadership team frequently discuss various ERM topics. Board members have significant expertise and experience in the energy sector, finance, economics, operations and public policy. The Board reviews key risks associated with our strategic plan, including emerging risks, annually at a designated strategy meeting and on an ongoing basis periodically throughout the year. The Board receives regular updates from its committees regarding their activities relative to risk oversight and reviews risks of a more strategic nature at the full Board level. 
Role of the Committees
Each of the Board's committees oversees the management of risks that fall within that committee's areas of responsibility. In performing this function, each committee has full access to management and may engage its own advisors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Committee Regularly reviews risks associated with financial and accounting matters, as well as those related to financial reporting.  Monitors compliance with regulatory requirements and internal control systems.  Oversees the ERM process.

Executive Succession Planning 
One of the Board's key functions is to provide for executive succession planning to avoid adverse effects caused by vacancies in key leadership positions. The Board recognizes that thoughtful succession planning is critical to creating long-term shareholder value.  
The Compensation Committee believes its succession process is an important tool that helps manage the lead time necessary to train, develop or recruit executives capable of filling key roles, including our named executive officers, 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
within the Company when the need arises. The Compensation Committee typically meets with the full Board at least annually to discuss succession of our leadership. During these meetings the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Identifies key roles (based on business impact and retention risk).  
• Assesses likely and possible successors for these roles, including their ability to reinforce our performance culture and promote our values including: Health and Safety, Environmental Stewardship, Integrity, Corporate Citizenship and Inclusive Culture. 
• Evaluates the readiness of succession candidates, including training and development needs.  
[END TABLE]
Although executive officers may choose to retire earlier, our policy of mandatory retirement coincident with, or immediately following, the first of the month after an officer reaches age 65 provides a known maximum time period for a qualified successor to prepare to assume the vacated position. In July 2018, in consideration of our pending acquisition of Andeavor in October 2018, the Board approved an exception to this policy for Messrs. Heminger and Kenney to enable their continued leadership through the integration of the combined Company.
Corporate Citizenship 
We believe that doing the right thing is the right way to conduct our business. In practice, the concept of corporate citizenship involves assessing all the potential ways that our actions impact others both inside and outside our operational fence lines. Our commitment to corporate citizenship means being accountable for our actions to a broad range of stakeholders: investors, employees, customers, suppliers, communities, business partners, and others who have a stake in how we operate.
Our Core Values
We have long-established core values, all of which are vital to our financial performance and to our corporate image and reputation. We manage our business to promote sustainable social, environmental and economic benefits to all stakeholders wherever we operate. By doing so, we create long-term value for our Company and shareholders, as well as the communities where we work and live.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Health and Safety    We have the highest regard for the health and safety of our employees, contractors and neighboring communities.  
Health and Safety    We have the highest regard for the health and safety of our employees, contractors and neighboring communities.  
Environmental Stewardship  We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact and continually look for ways to reduce our footprint. 
Integrity  We uphold the highest standards of business ethics and integrity, enforcing strict principles of corporate governance. We strive for transparency in all of our operations. 
Corporate Citizenship  We work to make a positive difference in the communities where we have the privilege to operate. 
Inclusive Culture  We value diversity and strive to provide our employees with a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive work environment where they can maximize their full potential for personal and business success.

2018 Citizenship Report We are proud to manufacture the affordable, safe, clean and reliable products that help make modern life possible. We do our important work while adhering to our core values. Among other enhancements in this year's Citizenship Report, we have provided additional insight into our corporate governance, as well as a closer look at our industry-leading energy-efficiency program. 
Perspectives on Climate-Related Scenarios Millions of people rely on us for the fuels and other products that make their lives better every day, and our shareholders rely on us to be good stewards of their investment. To meet these expectations, the Board of Directors and our executive leadership team anticipate and prepare for a variety of risks to our business. This report, modeled on the disclosures recommended by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, provides a detailed look at the Board's risk management oversight, climate-related scenario analyses, asset optimization and portfolio management, and concludes that we are well positioned to remain successful into the future.  
[END TABLE]
Political Engagement and Disclosure
We view our participation in the public policy process as essential to promoting our shareholders' best interests. The refining, transportation and marketing of fuels is heavily regulated by federal, state and local governments. As a result, developments in Washington, D.C., and in the capitals of the states where we do business can significantly affect our ability to meet the need for reliable, affordable transportation fuels and other petroleum products. In our political engagement efforts, we focus on maintaining a strong refining and marketing industry in the United States, continuing to meet the energy needs of consumers at competitive prices, and protecting the value of our shareholders' investments. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is committed to ensuring our exercise of political speech and involvement in the public policy process remains aligned with the interests of our shareholders. The Committee oversees and reviews our political contributions, lobbying expenditures and payments to trade associations that engage in lobbying activities. On the "Political Engagement and Disclosure" page of our website, we describe the roles of the Committee and various organizations within the Company in overseeing and promoting compliance with our political activity policy.
Because we recognize that our public policy activities are of interest to our shareholders and other stakeholders, we have included a number of voluntary disclosures on our website, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A statement of philosophy and purpose that includes several embedded links, including to public sources of information; 
• Federal lobbying reports that we file quarterly with the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives;  
• The states for which we have registered as a lobbyist employer or principal; 
• Itemized lists of corporate political contributions in an interactive map format;  
• Itemized lists of employee political action committee (PAC) contributions in an interactive map format; and 
• A list of trade associations to which MPC or its subsidiaries paid annual dues in excess of $50,000 for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Board Evaluations 
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees an annual Board and committee self-evaluation process providing each member of the Board the opportunity to complete detailed surveys designed to assess the effectiveness of both the Board as a whole and each of its committees. The surveys seek feedback on, among other things, Board and committee composition and organization, the frequency and content of Board and committee meetings, the quality of management presentations to the Board and its committees, the Board's relationship to senior management and the performance of the Board and its committees in light of the 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
responsibilities of each body as established in our Corporate Governance Principles and the respective committee charters. 
Along with these surveys, each director is asked to review the Corporate Governance Principles and the charter of each committee on which he or she serves, and to offer comments and revision suggestions as deemed appropriate. Summary reports of survey results are compiled and provided to the directors. Our Chairman and CEO and Lead Director lead a discussion of survey results with all of the directors as a group, and each committee chair leads a discussion of committee results within a committee meeting setting. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes this process, which combines the opportunity for each director to individually reflect on Board and committee effectiveness with a collaborative discussion on performance, provides a meaningful assessment tool and a forum for discussing areas for improvement.

Proposal 1. Election of Directors
Our Bylaws provide that the Board is divided into three classes of directors, which are to be as nearly equal in size as possible, with one class being elected each year. The Board has set the current number of directors at 12, with four directors in each class. Shareholders elect each class of directors for a term of three years. Any director vacancies created between annual shareholder meetings may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office. Any director appointed in this manner would hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders at which the term of office of the class to which he or she has been appointed expires. We expect each nominee will be able to serve if elected. 
Nominees for Class II Directors—Current Terms Expiring in 2019

Audit-Related Matters
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements and our report on internal control over financial reporting for 2018. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's standard, Auditing Standard No. 1301. The Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for independent auditor communications with audit committees concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements and the report on internal control over financial reporting for Marathon Petroleum Corporation be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

2019 Proxy Statement   21 
[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval of Audit Services 
We have established a Pre-Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Permissible Non-Audit Services Policy that, among other things, sets forth the procedure for the Audit Committee to pre-approve all audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services, other than as provided under a de minimis exception. 
Under the policy, the Audit Committee may pre-approve any services to be performed by our independent auditor up to 12 months in advance and may approve in advance services by specific categories pursuant to a forecasted budget. Once each year, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer presents a forecast of audit, audit-related, tax and permissible non-audit services to the Audit Committee for approval in advance. Our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the independent auditor, provides an updated budget to the Audit Committee, as needed, throughout the ensuing fiscal year. 
Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority of up to $500,000 to the Chair of the Audit Committee for unbudgeted items, and the Chair reports the items pre-approved pursuant to this delegation to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
In 2018 and 2017, our Audit Committee pre-approved all of these services in accordance with its pre-approval policy. Our Audit Committee did not utilize the policy's de minimis exception in 2018 or 2017.
Our pre-approval policy is posted on our website at www.marathonpetroleum.com by selecting "Investors" and "Corporate Governance," under the heading "Policies and Guidelines."
Certain Hiring Guidelines 
We have established Guidelines for Hiring of Employees or Former Employees of the Independent Auditor that ensure our compliance with applicable law and NYSE listing standards. These Guidelines are posted and can be found on our website at www.marathonpetroleum.com by selecting "Investors" and "Corporate Governance," under the heading "Policies and Guidelines."
Proposal 2. Ratification of Independent Auditor for 2019 
Our Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditor to audit the Company's books and accounts for the year ending December 31, 2019. While the Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, replacing, compensating and overseeing the work of the independent auditor, as a matter of good corporate governance, the Board has directed that this appointment be submitted to our shareholders for ratification. If our shareholders do not ratify this appointment, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines such change would be in our best interests or in the best interests of our shareholders. 
We expect representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers to be present at our Annual Meeting, with an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and to be available to respond to appropriate questions from our shareholders.
The Board of Directors recommends you vote FOR the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Shareholder Engagement and "Say-on-Pay" Voting Results
We regularly engage with our shareholders on a wide range of topics, including our NEOs' compensation. Since 2012, we have provided our shareholders with the opportunity to cast an annual advisory Say-on-Pay vote on our NEOs' compensation. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved our NEOs' compensation with approximately 92% of the vote. The Compensation Committee believes this strong level of support affirms the design and objectives of our executive compensation program, and this support influenced its decision to maintain a consistent overall approach for 2018. Shareholder engagement and the outcome of our annual Say-on-Pay vote will continue to inform our future compensation decisions.

At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our shareholders approved our named executive officer compensation  with approximately 92% of the vote.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our shareholders approved our named executive officer compensation  with approximately 92% of the vote.
Our shareholders have the opportunity to vote on our NEO compensation at the upcoming Annual Meeting. See Proposal 3 on page 67 of this Proxy Statement for more information on this advisory vote. 
[END TABLE]
Program Changes for 2018 
While the Compensation Committee is pleased with the high level of shareholder support for our NEOs' compensation indicated by our 2018 Say-on-Pay voting results, it continues to consider shareholder feedback and market data to be important inputs into our executive compensation program design. In early 2018, our Compensation Committee determined to alter the mix of long-term compensation awarded to our NEOs to consist of 50% performance units, an increase from 40% the previous year. The proportion of stock options awarded was correspondingly decreased to 30% from 40% the previous year. In addition, the minimum TSR/TUR percentile for payouts on MPC and MPLX performance units awarded in 2018 was increased to the 30th percentile from the 25th percentile. The Compensation Committee believes these changes align with its intent to compensate NEOs in a manner that is both market competitive and intended to enhance shareholder value.

How We Determine Executive Compensation
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
We believe our executive compensation program plays a critical role in maximizing long-term shareholder value. Our program supports our ability to attract, motivate, retain and reward the highest quality executives who we believe will create value for our shareholders by executing our business priorities, including strong operational performance and responsible corporate leadership. 
Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews our compensation philosophy to ensure it achieves these objectives, making adjustments as necessary to reflect peer group and industry practices, as well as shareholder feedback. Our current philosophy generally targets total direct compensation, defined as the aggregate of base salary plus target bonus plus intended value of annual LTI awards, for our NEOs at the median (50th percentile) of the compensation for similar executives of companies in our peer group. Our Compensation Committee believes that this focus on total direct compensation rather than each individual element of compensation plays a critical role in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the highest quality executives. 
The Compensation Committee has designed our executive compensation programs to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide fair and competitive levels of compensation, after taking into account individual roles and responsibilities, while allowing for the discretion to place each NEO within the competitive range of each pay element;  
• Align compensation programs with company and individual performance;  
• Foster an ownership culture that aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of shareholders;  
• Consider the cyclical commodity influences of the business; and  
• Discourage excessive risk-taking and appropriately align risk with reward. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Consultant
To promote objectivity in reviewing and analyzing market data and trends, the Compensation Committee has engaged Pay Governance LLC (the "Consultant") as its independent compensation consultant. The Consultant reports directly to our Compensation Committee, regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings and advises the Compensation Committee on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The design and implementation of our compensation policies and programs to accomplish our compensation objectives;  
• Comparative data on the executive compensation policies and practices of our peers; and 
• How our compensation programs and policies align with relevant regulatory requirements and governance standards.  
[END TABLE]
See "Compensation Governance—Compensation Committee Consultant Independence" for additional information about the Consultant's independence and related matters.
Our Peer Group 
For making pay decisions for 2018, the Compensation Committee used a compensation peer group developed in consultation with the Consultant. This peer group is large and diverse, comprised of energy and other chemical and industrial companies sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Compensation Committee believes that including certain companies outside the energy industry helps ensure the peer group is large enough to minimize year-over-year volatility in compensation data. Criteria used to select our peer group included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenues generally greater than $10 billion;  
• Heavy manufacturing operations;  
• Commodity exposure;  
• Safety and environmental focus; and  
• Availability of publicly reported information.  
[END TABLE]
Our peer group for 2018 compensation decisions was comprised of the following companies:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
3M Company The Dow Chemical Company Johnson Controls International plc 
Andeavor E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company Phillips 66 
The Boeing Company Eaton Corporation plc PPG Industries, Inc. 
Caterpillar Inc. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company United States Steel Corporation 
Chevron Corporation HollyFrontier Corporation United Technologies Corporation 
ConocoPhillips Honeywell International Inc. Valero Energy Corporation 
Deere & Company International Paper Company   
[END TABLE]
When the Compensation Committee approved this peer group in May 2017, we were at approximately the 23rd percentile of the group in terms of market capitalization and the 81st percentile in terms of revenue. In situations where there is insufficient peer-group data for comparative purposes, the Consultant reviews data from available survey sources encompassing a broader group of commodity-based manufacturing companies and provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee. 
In May 2018, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Consultant, approved a new peer group more reflective of our size and scope following our acquisition of Andeavor. The Committee replaced several smaller companies with larger companies and made other adjustments to reflect recent merger activity, including our acquisition of Andeavor. Our new peer group for 2018, which the Compensation Committee will use to make

Chevron Corporation General Motors Company United Technologies Corporation 
ConocoPhillips Halliburton Company Valero Energy Corporation 
  Honeywell International Inc.   
[END TABLE]
How We Use Market Data 
The Consultant works with our Human Resources compensation team to identify key job responsibilities for each NEO, and matches those responsibilities to comparable job descriptions of executives in our peer group. Market data based on these matches is used as a starting point for the evaluation of each NEO's base salary, short-term incentive targets and LTI awards. 
As noted above under "Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives," Total Direct Compensation for our NEOs is generally targeted at the median (50th percentile) of the compensation for similar executives of companies in our peer group. Additional factors may result in the actual level of compensation being above or below each NEO's respective market median, including but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The size and complexity of each NEO's role;  
• Each NEO's experience, contribution and demonstrated performance;  
• Our current and future succession needs;  
• Business results;  
• External competitiveness; and  
• Internal pay equity.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Decision-Making Process
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing executive compensation programs and policies that are consistent with our overall compensation philosophy. In making compensation decisions, the Committee considers a variety of factors, including information provided by the Consultant, market data from our peer group, input from the CEO, the factors listed in "How We Use Market Data," above, and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion.
The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session outside the presence of the CEO and other executive officers. While the Compensation Committee seeks significant input from the CEO on compensation decisions and performance appraisals for all executive officers other than himself, all final compensation decisions for our executive officers are made by the Committee.

2019 Proxy Statement   29 
[END TABLE]
"At-risk" means there is no guarantee that the target value of the awards will be realized. Based on its evaluation of performance, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to reduce, and even award nothing for, the performance-based payouts and individual performance adjustments under the ACB and performance unit awards. Stock options have no initial value and can expire with zero value if the price of our common stock does not appreciate above the grant date price over the 10-year term of the options. Restricted stock may lose value depending on stock price performance. Therefore, for NEOs to earn and sustain competitive compensation, we must meet our strategic objectives, perform well relative to our peers, and deliver market-competitive returns to our shareholders.
The Compensation Committee believes our flexibility to mix cash and equity allows us to reward NEOs based on potentially very different business and strategic objectives across our business segments, recognizing that some of our organizations (such as retail and transportation) compete for talent with companies in industries that typically have compensation structures significantly different than those of our core business. Based on data from peer group disclosures in 2018 and input from the Consultant, we believe our mix of pay elements is competitive with current market practices at our peer group companies.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's decision to increase Mr. Griffith's base salary in particular was based on his continued strong performance and the Committee's determination to bring him closer to the market median for his position. The Compensation Committee's decisions to increase the base salaries of Messrs. Heminger, Templin and Kenney reflect annual merit program increases to maintain market competitiveness.
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
2018 Annual Cash Bonus Program 
Our Annual Cash Bonus ("ACB") program motivates and rewards NEOs for achieving short-term financial and operational business objectives that drive overall performance and shareholder value, as well as for individual performance during the year. The program is designed to align pay with company and executive performance, consistent with our compensation philosophy and business strategy.
2018 ACB Program Structure
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee, based on management's recommendation, approved the ACB program for 2018. Awards under the ACB program for our NEOs are calculated as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annualized Base Salary X Bonus Target X Performance = Final Award 
    Bonus opportunities are expressed as a percentage of each NEO's base salary. The Compensation Committee approves target bonus opportunities for our NEOs based on analysis of market-competitive data of our compensation peer group, while also taking into consideration each executive's experience, relative scope of responsibility and potential, internal pay equity considerations and any other information the Committee deems relevant in its discretion.  At the beginning of the performance year, the Compensation Committee establishes the performance metrics. After the end of the performance year, the Compensation Committee reviews and assesses MPC's performance against the pre-established performance metrics, as well as other factors the Committee deems relevant in its discretion. The Committee also reviews and assesses each NEO's organizational and individual performance. Following this review, the Committee makes a final annual bonus decision for each NEO. Payout results may be above or below target based on actual MPC and individual performance.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes it is important for the ACB program to emphasize pre-established financial and operational (including environmental and safety) performance measures, and has determined to collectively weight these measures at 70%, as reflected in the table below. The remaining 30% is driven by a number of discretionary factors, including business results in light of opportunities and challenges encountered during the year and adjustments due to the volatility in petroleum-related commodity prices throughout the year, which makes it difficult to establish reliable, pre-determined goals, and individual performance achievements. The threshold, target and maximum levels of performance for each performance metric were established for 2018 by evaluating factors such as performance achieved in the prior year(s), anticipated challenges for 2018, our business plan and our overall strategy. At the time the performance levels were set for 2018, the threshold levels were viewed as likely achievable, the target levels were viewed as challenging but achievable, and the maximum levels were viewed as extremely difficult to achieve. The table below provides the goals for each metric, target weighting and our performance achieved in 2018 ($ in millions):

Andeavor's 2018 Incentive Compensation Program
Mr. Goff commenced employment with us effective October 1, 2018, and thus was not eligible to participate in the 2018 ACB. His cash bonus for 2018 was determined under the Andeavor Incentive Compensation Program ("ICP"), which was approved in February 2018 by the compensation committee of Andeavor's board of directors. The 2018 ICP structure provided all employees under the program, including Mr. Goff, with the same upward and downward bonus opportunity (0% below threshold; 50% at threshold; 100% at target; and 200% at maximum; with interpolation between levels), subject to adjustment based on individual performance. The calculation for determining the total payout to Mr. Goff was:

For the calculation of both the EBITDA and cost management measures, the Compensation Committee had the discretion to take into consideration special items, including decisions that have a material impact on Andeavor's results compared to budget, unusual items and non-recurring items. In calculating the EBITDA measure results, the Compensation Committee made adjustments to account for acquisition and transaction-related costs that were not included in the original targets and bonus related cost increases and decreases relative to the original target. In calculating the cost management measure results, the Compensation Committee made adjustments to account for an accounting classification change that moved logistics related service costs from Cost of Sales to Operating Expense after targets were set.
The 2018 ICP provided that Mr. Goff's payout could be adjusted above or below the amount determined by Andeavor's overall corporate performance based on an assessment of his overall performance, taking into account

LTI awards represent a compensation opportunity. The actual long-term compensation value realized by our NEOs will depend on the price of our underlying stock at the time of settlement. The 2018 LTI awards were based on an intended dollar value rather than a specific number of performance units, stock options or shares of restricted stock. Each form of LTI award is discussed in more detail below.
Mr. Goff commenced employment with us on October 1, 2018 and did not receive an LTI award for 2018. His Letter Agreement provides that he will receive an LTI award, valued at $12,250,000, for 2019.
Changes to LTI Components for 2018 
As a result of its ongoing analysis of peer data and as part of its continuing effort to be responsive to feedback from our shareholders, the Compensation Committee made the following changes to the LTI program for 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The overall mix of LTI awards was changed so that, beginning with awards granted in 2018, at least 50% of MPC annual LTI awards will be in the form of performance units.  
• Beginning with 2018 awards, the minimum TSR/TUR percentile for a payout on performance units will increase to the 30th percentile from the 25th percentile.  
[END TABLE]
MPC Performance Units 
The Compensation Committee believes that TSR is the best overall pay-for-performance metric to align our NEOs' interests with shareholder interests. Our performance units evaluate MPC's TSR relative to a peer group of oil industry competitors and a market index. This relative evaluation recognizes the cyclical nature of our business and 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   35 
[END TABLE]
commodity prices (crude oil) and prevents volatility from directly advantaging or disadvantaging the payout of the award beyond that of our peers. Our performance units are designed to ensure we pay above target compensation only when our TSR is above the median of the peer group. 
TSR for MPC and each of the peer group companies is measured over a 36-month performance cycle. Each performance cycle has four equally weighted measurement periods: (i) the first 12 months; (ii) the second 12 months; (iii) the third 12 months; and (iv) the entire 36-month period. The Compensation Committee believes that this structure is appropriate as maximum payout based on TSR may only be achieved by outperforming the TSR peer group for all four measurement periods. 
Each peer group member's TSR for a measurement period is determined by the following formula: 
(Ending Stock Price - Beginning Stock Price) + Cumulative Cash Dividends 
Beginning Stock Price 
The beginning and ending stock prices used for MPC and each peer group member in the TSR calculation are the averages of each company's closing stock price for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the beginning and ending date of the applicable measurement period. This helps mitigate significant market fluctuations in stock price at the beginning or end of a performance cycle and discourages excessive or inappropriate risk-taking near the end of a performance cycle by limiting the impact on the overall payout of the award. 
Our TSR performance percentile within the peer group is measured for each measurement period, with the related payout percentage determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
TSR Percentile Payout (% of Target) (a) 
100th (Highest) 200% 
50th 100% 
25th (b) 50% 
Below 25th (b) 0% 
(a) Payout for performance between quartiles will be determined using linear interpolation. 
(b) Increased to the 30th percentile for awards granted in 2018 and thereafter. 
[END TABLE]
Each performance unit is denominated in dollars with a target value of $1.00. The actual payout may vary from $0.00 to $2.00 (0% to 200% of target). The Compensation Committee believes that capping the maximum payout at 200% mitigates excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. In addition, if MPC's TSR is negative for a measurement period, the payout percentage for that measurement period is capped at target (100%) regardless of actual relative TSR performance percentile. The final value of the performance unit award will be determined by multiplying the simple average of the payout percentages for the four measurement periods by the number of performance units granted. These awards settle 25% in MPC common stock and 75% in cash. Unvested performance units do not receive dividends and do not have voting rights. 
Performance units granted in 2016 had a performance cycle of January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2018. The peer group for these performance units was: Andeavor, Chevron Corporation, HollyFrontier Corporation, PBF Energy, Phillips 66, Valero Energy Corporation and the S&P 500 Energy Index. Due to industry consolidation, Andeavor was removed from the group effective January 1, 2018.
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee certified the final TSR results for the four applicable measurement periods as follows:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Measurement Period Actual TSR (%) Position Percentile Ranking (%) Payout (% of Target) 
January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2016 (1.8) 5th 42.86 85.72

      Average: 115.48 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Based on the resulting average, each performance unit granted was multiplied by $1.1548, and the Compensation Committee approved the following payouts to our NEOs:

[END TABLE]
MPC Stock Options 
Stock options provide a direct but variable link between our NEOs' long-term compensation and the long-term value shareholders receive by investing in MPC. The Compensation Committee believes stock options are inherently performance-based as option holders realize benefits only if the value of our stock increases for all shareholders after the grant date. The exercise price of our stock options is generally equal to the per-share closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Stock options generally vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and expire 10 years following the grant date. Option holders do not have voting rights or receive dividends on the underlying stock. See the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table below for the number of options granted to our NEOs in 2018.  
MPC Restricted Stock 
Our Compensation Committee awards restricted stock to our NEOs to promote their ownership of actual shares of our common stock, to help them comply with our stock ownership guidelines and to promote their retention. Awards generally vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. Unvested restricted stock awards accrue dividends, which are paid upon vesting. Holders of unvested restricted stock have voting rights. See the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table below for the number of shares of restricted stock granted to our NEOs in 2018. 
MPLX Performance Units 
The Compensation Committee and the MPLX Committee believe that MPLX performance unit awards align our NEOs' interests with the interests of our shareholders and MPLX's unitholders. Performance units granted in 2016 are based on TUR relative to a peer group of midstream companies, as further described below. In 2017, the MPLX Committee added a DCF-per-MPLX-common-unit metric to the MPLX performance unit program to align it with contemporary industry program design. The MPLX Committee believes the TUR and DCF metrics are important indicators of performance as they are commonly used by unitholders to measure a master limited partnership's ("MLP") performance against others within the same industry. Achieving above-target payouts would require at least one of these two metrics to achieve above-target performance. 
TUR for MPLX and each peer group MLP is measured over a 36-month performance cycle. Each performance cycle has four equally weighted measurement periods: (i) the first 12 months; (ii) the second 12 months; (iii) the third 12 months; and (iv) the entire 36-month period. The MPLX Committee believes this structure is appropriate as maximum payout based on TUR may only be achieved by outperforming the TUR peer group for all four measurement periods.
Each peer group member's TUR is determined by the following formula: 
(Ending Unit Price - Beginning Unit Price) + Cumulative Cash Distributions 
Beginning Unit Price 
The beginning and ending unit prices used for MPLX and each peer group member in the TUR calculation are the averages of each company's closing unit price for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the beginning or ending date of the applicable measurement period. This helps mitigate significant market fluctuations in unit price at the beginning or end of a performance cycle and discourages excessive or inappropriate risk-taking near the end of a performance cycle by limiting the impact on the overall payout of the award. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The MPLX Committee believes that capping the maximum payout at 200% mitigates excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. In addition, if MPLX's TUR is negative for a measurement period, the payout percentage for that measurement period is capped at target (100%) regardless of actual relative TUR performance percentile. These awards settle 25% in MPLX common units and 75% in cash. Holders of unvested performance units do not receive cash distributions and do not have voting rights.
Performance units granted in 2016 had a performance cycle of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. The peer group for these performance units was: Andeavor Logistics LP, Buckeye Partners, L.P., Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., Enterprise Products Partners L.P., Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Phillips 66 Partners LP, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P., Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., Valero Energy Partners LP, Western Gas Partners, LP and Williams Partners L.P. Due to industry consolidations, ONEOK Partners, L.P. and Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. were removed from the group effective January 1, 2017, and Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P., Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. and Williams Partners L.P. were removed from the group effective January 1, 2018.

MPLX performance units granted to our NEOs in 2017 and 2018 remain outstanding. See the "Outstanding Equity at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table below for additional information about these awards, including the amount granted, the performance cycle, and the applicable peer group. 
MPLX Phantom Units 
Grants of phantom units promote increased ownership by our NEOs of MPLX common units, which strengthens alignment between our NEOs' interests and the interests of MPLX's unitholders, including us. The value of phantom unit awards is variable, based on the value of an underlying MPLX common unit. Awards generally vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date and are settled in MPLX common units. Distribution equivalents accrue on the phantom unit awards and are paid upon vesting. Holders of unvested phantom units have no voting rights. NEOs are required to hold all MPLX common units received upon vesting of phantom units for at least one year. This requirement applies to units net of taxes at the time of vesting or distribution. See the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table below for the number of phantom units granted to our NEOs in 2018. 
Other Benefits
In addition to the three key compensation elements described above, our NEOs are generally eligible to participate in our market-competitive health and life insurance plans, long-term and short-term disability programs, retirement and severance programs. We also provide limited perquisites to our NEOs that are consistent with our business strategy and/or market-based trends. None of these additional programs are considered material by the Compensation Committee when making compensation decisions. 
Retirement Benefits
Retirement benefits provided to our NEOs are designed to be consistent in value and aligned with benefits offered by the other companies with which we compete for talent. Benefits payable under our qualified and nonqualified plans are described in more detail in "Post-Employment Benefits" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation."
Severance Benefits 
We have not entered into individual severance or change-in-control agreements with our NEOs. However, our Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan and the MPLX LP Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan accomplish several specific objectives, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Providing and preserving an economic motivation for participating executives to consider a business combination that might result in an executive's job loss; and  
• Competing effectively in attracting and retaining executives in an industry that features frequent mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  
[END TABLE]
Our change in control benefits are described in more detail in "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Perquisites 
We offer limited perquisites to our NEOs. Based on the Consultant's analysis and advice, we believe the perquisites we offer are consistent with those offered by our peer group companies. 
Our NEOs are eligible for reimbursement for certain tax, estate and financial planning services up to $15,000 per year while serving as an executive officer and $3,000 in the year following retirement or death. The Compensation Committee believes this benefit is appropriate due to the complexities of income tax preparation for our NEOs, who may, for example, be required to make personal income tax filings in multiple states as a result of receiving MPLX common units. 
We also offer enhanced annual physical health examinations for our senior management, including our NEOs, to promote their health and well-being. Under our program, these officers are eligible for a comprehensive physical (generally in the form of a one-day appointment), with procedures similar to those available to all other employees under our health program. 
The primary use of our corporate aircraft is for business purposes and must be authorized by our CEO or another executive officer designated by our Board or our CEO. Occasionally, spouses or other guests may accompany our NEOs or other executive officers on corporate aircraft, or our NEOs or other executive officers may travel for personal purposes on corporate aircraft when space is available on business-related flights. When a spouse's or guest's travel does not meet the Internal Revenue Service standard for business use, the cost of that travel is imputed as income to the NEO or other executive officer. 
Our Board has authorized and recommends the personal use of corporate aircraft for our CEO to promote his safety, security and productivity. The value of such personal use is periodically reported to and monitored by the Compensation Committee and is taxable income to our CEO. In addition, we provide limited security benefits to our CEO, the costs of which are primarily attributable to the maintenance, operation and monitoring of enhanced security systems. The Committee feels these security measures are appropriate given the growing public profile of our CEO and the publicity given to those in our industry. 
Reportable values for these perquisites, based on the incremental costs to us, are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table." 
We do not provide income tax assistance or tax gross-ups on our executive perquisites.

[END TABLE]
Each officer must hold all equity we grant until the applicable ownership guideline has been achieved. As of December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs had met their stock ownership guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
The guidelines also require that these officers hold all full-value shares of MPC common stock received under our incentive compensation plan, including upon the settlement of performance units, for a minimum of one year following the date those shares are earned or vest. 
Prohibition on Derivatives and Hedging 
We prohibit hedging transactions related to our common stock or pledging or creating security interests in our common stock, including shares held in excess of the amount required under our stock ownership guidelines. This ensures that our NEOs bear the full risk of MPC common stock ownership. 
Recoupment/Clawback Policy 
Our NEOs are subject to recoupment provisions under the ACB and LTI programs in the case of certain forfeiture events. If we are required, as a result of a determination made by the SEC or our Audit Committee, to prepare a material accounting restatement due to noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws as a result of misconduct, our Compensation Committee may decide that a forfeiture event has occurred based on an assessment of whether an executive officer, including our NEOs: (i) knowingly engaged in misconduct; (ii) was grossly negligent with respect to misconduct; (iii) knowingly failed or was grossly negligent in failing to prevent misconduct; or (iv) engaged in fraud, embezzlement or other similar misconduct materially harmful to us. 
If it is determined that a forfeiture event has occurred, the Compensation Committee has the right to request and receive reimbursement of any portion of an executive officer's bonus from the ACB program that would not have been earned had the forfeiture event not taken place. In addition, the executive's unexercised stock options, unvested restricted stock and outstanding performance units would be subject to immediate forfeiture. If a forfeiture event occurred either while the executive officer was employed, or within three years after termination of employment, and a payment had previously been made to the executive officer in settlement of performance units, the Compensation Committee would have the right to recoup an amount in cash up to the amount paid in settlement of the performance units. 
These recoupment provisions are in addition to the requirements under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require the CEO and CFO to reimburse the company for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation, as well as any related profits received in the 12-month period prior to the filing of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct. Additionally, all equity grants made since 2012 include provisions making them subject to any clawback provisions required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and to any other "clawback" provisions as required by law or by the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. 
Tax Policy 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"), generally disallows a tax deduction to a public corporation for compensation over $1 million paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers). Historically, Section 162(m) exempted qualifying performance-based compensation from the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Significant aspects of our compensation programs were designed to permit (but not require) compensation to potentially qualify for this performance-based exception. To accomplish this, we previously asked shareholders to approve equity and incentive compensation plans that included limitations and provisions required to be included under Section 162(m). 
Tax reform legislation amended Section 162(m) in December of 2017 to: (i) eliminate the exemption for performance-based compensation, other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017, and in effect on that date; and (ii) expand the group of current and former executive officers who may be covered by the Section 162(m) deduction limit. 
While our shareholder-approved incentive plans are structured to provide that certain awards could be made in a manner intended to potentially qualify for the performance-based compensation exemption, that exemption is no longer available for tax years after 2017, other than with respect to certain "grandfathered" arrangements as noted above. Our Compensation Committee expects in the future to authorize compensation in excess of $1 million to our NEOs that will not be deductible under Section 162(m) when it believes doing so is in the best interests of us and our shareholders. Additionally, with the performance-based compensation exception no longer available, we will no longer include specific Section 162(m)-related limitations or provisions or request shareholder approval for this purpose, and generally will not attempt to meet the requirements previously included in our plans related to the now eliminated performance-based compensation exception under the prior Section 162(m) regime as there is no tax benefit from doing so.

Compensation Committee Consultant Independence
The Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance LLC (the "Consultant") as its independent compensation consultant for 2018. While the Compensation Committee oversees the Consultant's activities, the Consultant does interact with management to gather information and formalize proposals for presentation to the Committee. During 2018, the only services the Consultant provided to us or our management were directly related to executive or director compensation matters.
In determining that the advice it receives from the Consultant is objective and not influenced by the Consultant's working relationship with MPC or the Compensation Committee, the Committee considered:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Consultant's provision of other services to us; 
• The amount of fees we paid the Consultant, as a percentage of the Consultant's total revenue; 
• The Consultant's policies and procedures that are designed to prevent internal conflicts; 
• Any business or personal relationship of the Consultant with the members of the Compensation Committee or our executive officers; and 
• Any of our stock owned by the Consultant. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has considered and assessed all relevant factors, including those required by the SEC that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to the Consultant in 2018. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee determined that the Consultant's work performed during 2018 did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
Compensation-Based Risk Assessment 
Annually, the Consultant performs an assessment of the risks associated with our compensation programs. In January 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed the most recent assessment of our policies and practices for compensating our executive officers and non-executive employees as they relate to our risk management profile. This assessment noted the following risk-mitigating factors:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee annually reviews analyses on targeted compensation, actual compensation and stock ownership, and employs a philosophy of targeting total compensation at the peer group median;  
• The mix of fixed versus variable compensation and cash versus equity is reasonable;   
• Key functions are involved in establishing, reviewing and administering our incentive plans to ensure accuracy and transparency;  
• Incentive awards are generally capped at a maximum payout of 200% of target;  
• Metrics used within incentive plans align with shareholder value creation;  
• A comprehensive process is followed when determining incentive goals, which incorporates significant discussion between management and the Compensation Committee;      
• Executive officers are required to comply with a rigorous stock ownership policy and an additional holding policy on earned or vested full-value shares;  
• Long-term incentive awards vest over multi-year periods;  
• Appropriate levels of review, approval and governance support compensation decisions;  
• We maintain an insider trading policy, an anti-hedging policy and a recoupment policy that addresses the restatement of results; and  
• The full Board plays an active role in leadership succession planning.  
[END TABLE]
Following its assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs are appropriate to meet our business objectives; 
• Our compensation programs are balanced in composition between cash and equity; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs are balanced in composition between annual and long-term performance; and  
• Any risks arising from our compensation programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Rohr (Chair), Alkhayyal, Bunch, Davis and Galante and Ms. James served on our Compensation Committee during 2018. The Board determined that each member qualified as independent. As Chairman of MPLX GP, the general partner of MPLX, and of TLGP, the general partner of ANDX, Mr. Heminger participates in compensation decisions for those entities. During 2018, none of our other executive officers served as a member of a compensation committee or board of directors of another entity that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Compensation Committee or Board of Directors.  
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for 2018 with management and, based on such review and discussions, recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(g) The amounts shown in this column reflect our aggregate incremental cost of personal use of corporate aircraft by our NEOs, their spouses or other guests for 2018, estimated using the average costs of operating the aircraft, such as fuel costs, trip-related maintenance, crew travel expenses, trip-related fees, storage costs, communications charges and other miscellaneous variable costs. Fixed costs, such as pilot compensation, the purchase and lease of aircraft and maintenance not related to travel are excluded from this calculation. We believe this method provides a reasonable estimate of our incremental cost; however, it overstates the actual incremental cost when a flight has a primary business purpose, space is available to transport an officer or his or her guest not traveling for business purposes and no incremental cost is realized by us. No income tax assistance or gross-ups are provided for personal use of corporate aircraft. 
(h) The amounts shown in this column reflect our contributions under our tax-qualified retirement plans and related nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The amounts shown for Mr. Goff also include matching and profit sharing contributions under the Andeavor Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.

(c) Target amounts reflect the number of performance units granted. Each performance unit has a target value of $1.00. The threshold for the award is the minimum possible payout of the award, which is 12.5%. The threshold is achieved when the payout percentage is 50% for one measurement period and 0% for the other three measurement periods, thus an average payout percentage of 12.5% for the performance cycle. The maximum payout for this award is 200% of target.  
(d) Reflects the total grant date fair value calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The Black-Scholes value used for the stock options was $17.37 per share. The restricted stock value was based on the closing price of $64.79 per share of MPC common stock on the grant date. The MPC performance units have a grant date fair value of $0.83 per unit as calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 23 to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The MPLX phantom unit value was based on the closing price of $34.89 per unit of MPLX common units on the grant date. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 22 to MPLX's financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. No total grant date fair value for the MPLX

performance units has been determined under FASB ASC Topic 718 because the MPLX Committee sets the DCF levels for these awards at the beginning of each performance year; thus, the DCF levels for the second and third performance years have not yet been set.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(e) These awards were granted to Messrs. Heminger and Kenney as part of the correction of an erroneous 2018 payment of their outstanding MPLX phantom unit awards, which was fully corrected in 2018 pursuant to applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance. Messrs. Heminger and Kenney took no part in the decision to make the erroneous payment. The correction restored them to the same economic position that they would have been in had the payment not occurred.

(a) Stock options have a maximum term for exercise of 10 years from the grant date. They generally become exercisable in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.  
(b) Awards granted prior to June 30, 2011 were made by Marathon Oil. The Marathon Oil awards converted to MPC equity awards when MPC separated from Marathon Oil in 2011, and remain subject to the original vesting schedules.  
(c) Amounts for NEOs other than Mr. Goff reflect the number of shares of MPC unvested restricted stock and MPLX phantom units held on December 31, 2018. Restricted stock and phantom units generally vest in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. MPC restricted stock and MPLX phantom unit awards to our NEOs generally provide for full vesting upon termination of employment due to "Mandatory Retirement," which refers to our general policy that our officers retire on the first day of the month after they attain age 65. Messrs. Heminger and Kenney became eligible for Mandatory Retirement on October 1, 2018 and November 1, 2018, respectively. Under applicable tax rules, this retirement eligibility caused Messrs. Heminger and Kenney to "vest" in their restricted stock awards for income tax and payroll tax (e.g., FICA taxes) purposes, and in their phantom unit awards for payroll tax purposes, notwithstanding that they continue to be employed, because on and after their respective retirement eligibility dates no substantial risk of forfeiture applies to these awards. While these awards continue to be reflected in this table, the portion used to pay the associated taxes has been excluded from this table, and is instead included in the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018" table below. 
[END TABLE]
Amounts for Mr. Goff reflect the number of MPC restricted stock units and ANDX phantom units, converted upon the Andeavor Merger from prior Andeavor equity awards and ANDX performance unit awards, respectively, held on December 31, 2018. These awards were granted under the Andeavor 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Andeavor Logistics LP 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan, respectively, and remain subject to their original vesting schedules. These awards generally provide for pro rata vesting based on the number of full months worked during the awards' original performance period once Mr. Goff became retirement eligible, which occurred on May 1, 2015. Under applicable tax rules, this retirement eligibility caused Mr. Goff to "vest" in a pro rata portion of his restricted stock unit awards for payroll tax (e.g., FICA taxes) purposes, and in a pro rata portion of his phantom unit awards for payroll tax purposes, upon their conversion on October 1, 2018, because on and after such date no substantial risk of forfeiture applies to these awards. While these awards continue to be reflected in this table, the portion used to pay the associated taxes has been excluded from this table, and is instead included in the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018" table below.

Post-Employment Benefits for 2018 
Pension Benefits 
We provide tax-qualified retirement benefits to our employees, including certain of our NEOs, under the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan. While most employees of Speedway do not participate in the Plan, some receive tax-qualified retirement benefits under the Speedway Retirement Plan, and certain of our NEOs also receive benefits under that plan. Following our acquisition of Andeavor, certain employees receive retirement benefits under the Andeavor Pension Plan, and one of our NEOs also receives benefits under that plan. In addition, we sponsor the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan, the Speedway Excess Benefit Plan and the Andeavor Executive Security Plan ("Excess Plans"), which are unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plans made available to a select group of management or highly compensated employees, including our NEOs.

The present value of accumulated benefit for the Speedway Retirement Plan was calculated assuming a discount rate of 4.20%, the 94GAR mortality table for lump sums, a 96% lump sum election rate and retirement at age 65 (or current age, if later). In accordance with the Speedway Retirement Plan provisions and actuarial assumptions, the discount rate for lump sum calculations was 2.62% for the Speedway legacy benefit formula and 2.82% for the pension equity formula, for the anticipated year of retirement for those with Speedway benefits.

equal 11% of his applicable compensation. Based on the age and service calculation specified in the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan, Mr. Templin will receive a supplemental nonqualified contribution set at 2% of eligible compensation in the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan. This supplemental contribution will be decreased over time as Mr. Templin's age and service increase; he will be eligible for the full 11% contribution in his qualified plan in 2022.  
Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan (Defined Benefit Portion)
The Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This Plan generally provides benefits that participants, including our NEOs, would have otherwise received under the tax-qualified Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan were it not for Internal Revenue Code limitations. For our NEOs, eligible earnings under this Plan include the items listed above, excluding bonuses, for the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan, as well as deferred compensation contributions, for the highest consecutive 36-month period over the 10-year period up to December 31, 2012. This Plan also provides an enhancement for executive officers using the three highest bonuses earned over the 10-year period up to December 31, 2012, instead of the consecutive bonus formula in place for non-officers. We believe this enhancement is appropriate in light of the greater volatility of executive officer bonuses. As Messrs. Griffith, Templin and Goff have not accrued a benefit under the Marathon legacy benefit formula, they are not eligible for this enhancement. 
Due to the structure of the frozen Marathon legacy benefit formula under the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan, the age-related lump sum benefit conversion factors used to calculate lump sum benefits under the frozen legacy final average pay benefit formula result in a year-to-year decrease in the lump sum benefit for participants generally beginning on or after the age of 59. As a result, if participants choose to continue their employment with MPC after they reach age 59, their lump sum benefit may decline year to year. 
The Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan permits the Compensation Committee, on a discretionary basis, to extend a lump sum retirement benefit supplement ("Service Benefit") to individual officers of MPC to offset the age-related erosion of benefit from age 62 until such officer's actual retirement date or date of death. An officer must be vested under the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan to qualify for the Service Benefit. The Compensation Committee previously extended eligibility for the Service Benefit to Messrs. Heminger and Kenney. 
The Service Benefit will not correct for any age-related erosion of benefit occurring prior to an officer reaching age 62 but, for those officers selected by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, the Service Benefit will correct for the age-related erosion of benefit from age 62 until such officer's actual retirement date or date of death. If an officer who has been offered the Service Benefit retires or dies after reaching age 62 and while an active employee with us, the officer's Service Benefit will be calculated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the lump sum interest rate upon the officer reaching the age of 62 used to calculate the retirement lump sum benefit is less than or equal to the lump sum interest rate as of the officer's actual retirement date or date of death, the Service Benefit shall be the difference between the legacy lump sum benefit he or she would have been eligible to receive using the age 62 lump sum conversion factor based on the lump sum interest rate in effect on the actual retirement date or date of death and the legacy lump sum benefit he or she is eligible to receive using the lump sum conversion factor for the actual age at retirement or death based on the lump sum interest rate in effect on the actual retirement date or date of death; or  
• If the lump sum interest rate upon the officer reaching the age of 62 used to calculate the retirement lump sum benefit is greater than the lump sum interest rate as of the officer's actual retirement date or date of death, the Service Benefit shall be the difference between the legacy lump sum benefit he or she would have been eligible to receive using the lump sum conversion factor and lump sum interest rate in effect at age 62 and the legacy lump sum benefit he or she is eligible to receive using the lump sum conversion factor and lump sum interest rate in effect on the actual retirement date or date of death.  
[END TABLE]
As intended by the Compensation Committee, the Service Benefit does not compensate for unfavorable fluctuations in the lump sum interest rate and is in fact structured to prevent payment of a Service Benefit greater than intended within a favorable interest rate environment; the Service Benefit is designed to correct only for the benefit erosion an officer may experience for continued employment with us after reaching the age of 62.

Speedway Excess Benefit Plan 
Speedway also sponsors the Speedway Excess Benefit Plan, an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This plan provides participants, including Messrs. Heminger and Kenney, with benefits that otherwise would have been received from the tax-qualified Speedway Retirement Plan were it not for Internal Revenue Code limitations. For our NEOs, eligible earnings under this Plan include the items listed above, excluding bonuses, for the Speedway Retirement Plan, as well as deferred compensation contributions, for the highest consecutive 36-month period over the 10-year period up to December 31, 2012. The Speedway Excess Benefit Plan also provides an enhancement for executive officers using the three highest bonuses earned over the 10-year period up to December 31, 2012, instead of the consecutive bonus formula in place for non-officers. Speedway believes this enhancement is 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
appropriate in light of the greater volatility of executive officer bonuses. Effective January 1, 2013, this Plan was amended to cease further compensation updates; therefore, Messrs. Heminger and Kenney have not accrued any additional benefits under this Plan since that date. A participant must be vested under the Speedway Retirement Plan to be eligible for an excess retirement benefit. 
The Speedway Excess Benefit Plan additionally provides benefits for eligible participants equal to the non-elective 3.5% Company contribution they otherwise would have received under the tax-qualified Retirement Savings Sub-Plan of the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan were it not for Internal Revenue Code limitations. Mr. Kenney was eligible for this contribution paid in 2015. At that time, the Retirement Savings Sub-Plan provided this non-elective contribution as applied to eligible compensation for eligible Speedway employees (all employees age 21 or older who have completed one year of service, have worked more than 1,000 hours and are employed on the last day of the year), including Mr. Kenney. Mr. Kenney, along with certain other Speedway employees, now participates in the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan; therefore, he is no longer eligible for the non-elective 3.5% Company contribution. 
Andeavor Pension Plan 
The Andeavor Pension Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan with a monthly benefit made up of two components: (i) a final average pay benefit for service through December 31, 2010, and (ii) a cash balance account based benefit for service after December 31, 2010. The final benefit payable under the Andeavor Pension Plan is equal to the value of the sum of both the final average pay and the cash balance components on the participant's benefit commencement date.
For service prior to December 31, 2010, the final average pay benefit is 1.1% of final average compensation for each year of service through December 31, 2010, plus 0.5% of average compensation in excess of the Social Security Covered Compensation limit for each year of service through December 31, 2010, up to 35 years. Final average compensation is the monthly average of compensation (including base pay plus bonus, but limited to the maximum compensation and benefit limits allowable for qualified plans under the Internal Revenue Code) over the consecutive 36-month period in the last 120 months preceding retirement that produces the highest average.
For service after 2010, participants earn pay and interest credits under the cash balance component. Pay credits are determined based on a percentage of eligible pay at the end of each quarter, ranging from 4.5% to 8.5% of pay based on a participant's age at the end of each quarter. Interest is credited quarterly on account balances based on a minimum of 3%, the 10-Year Treasury Bonds or the 30-Year Treasury Bonds, whichever is higher. The cash balance benefit component for service after 2010 is always based on the actual balance of the cash balance account as of the payment date and is not subject to any reduction for payment prior to normal retirement.
Benefits are generally payable the first day of the month following the attainment of age 65 and the completion of at least three years of service. For the Andeavor Pension Plan's final average pay component, if a participant qualifies for early retirement (age 50 with service plus age greater than or equal to 80, which is referred to as "80-point early retirement," or age 55 with five years of service, which is referred to as "regular early retirement"), the final average pay benefit component will be reduced by a subsidized early retirement factor prior to age 65. Under the 80-point early retirement definition, the final average pay benefit component may be paid at age 60 without reduction or earlier than age 60 with a reduction of 5% per year for each year the age at retirement is less than 60. Under the regular early retirement definition, the final average pay benefit component may be paid at age 62 without reduction or earlier than age 62 with a reduction of approximately 7.14% per year for each year prior to age 62. If an employee does not qualify for early retirement upon separation from service, they will be eligible for an actuarially equivalent final average pay benefit based on their age at the date the benefit is paid without an early retirement subsidy. For the Plan's cash balance benefit component, a vested participant may retire at any age prior to age 65 and receive an unreduced benefit.
As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Goff meets the Andeavor Pension Plan's regular early retirement criteria for his benefit under the Plan's final average pay component, and he is eligible to retire and receive an unreduced payment of his benefit under the Plan's cash balance component.
Effective at the close of December 31, 2018, the Andeavor Pension Plan was frozen as to new participants and as to further benefit accruals; provided, however, that existing participants continue to receive interest credits on their cash balance component benefit and continue to receive service crediting for vesting and early retirement eligibility purposes.

Andeavor Executive Security Plan 
The Andeavor Executive Security Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees, and was closed to new participants in 2010. Final average compensation under this plan is calculated by averaging the three highest annual compensation amounts over the last seven calendar years. For this purpose, compensation includes base pay plus bonus (counted in the year earned not paid). The gross monthly retirement benefit is equal to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 4% of final average compensation for each of the first 10 years of service; plus  
• 2% of final average compensation for each of the next 10 years of service; plus  
• 1% of final average compensation for each of the last 10 years of service;  
• For a maximum gross monthly retirement benefit of 70% of final average compensation for up to 30 years of service. 
[END TABLE]
The gross monthly retirement benefit is reduced by any benefits paid from the qualified Andeavor Pension Plan, and, after age 62, estimated Social Security benefits. To qualify to receive payments under the plan, a participant must separate from the company after attaining age 50 with 80 points or age 55 and with at least five years of service. Payments prior to attaining age 60 will be reduced by 7% per year for each year less than 60 (prorated for partial years). As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Goff is eligible to receive retirement payments under this plan.
The Andeavor Executive Security Plan also provides for certain death and disability benefits. The death benefits are equal to the greater of (i) the executive's benefit under the plan determined at date of death, (ii) the actuarial equivalent of 400% of the executive's base pay, prior to the date of death, and (iii) the benefit determined as if the executive had remained an active employee through age 65 and was paid a benefit at age 65. The monthly payment would be payable for the life of the beneficiary, reduced by the amount of the applicable Social Security benefits. Effective at the close of December 31, 2018, the Executive Security Plan was frozen such that no further benefits will accrue under the Plan. 
If the executive becomes disabled, he is entitled to the monthly retirement benefit for which he would be eligible at his normal retirement date, but based upon the service the participant would have accrued had he remained in active employment until his retirement date and continued at the same rate of earnings until that date. Monthly payments would be payable on the first day of the month following the date on which the executive has both attained age 65 and has a minimum of five years of service.

The Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan ("Thrift Plan") is a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. In general, all of our employees and Speedway employees, including our NEOs, are immediately eligible to participate in the Thrift Plan. The purpose of the Thrift Plan is to assist employees in maintaining a steady program of savings to supplement their retirement income and to meet other financial needs.
The Thrift Plan allows eligible employees, such as our NEOs, to make elective deferral contributions to their plan accounts on a pre-tax or after-tax "Roth" basis from 1% to a maximum of 75% of their Plan-considered gross pay, with such gross pay limited to the applicable Internal Revenue Code annual compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018). Employer matching contributions are made on such elective deferrals at a rate of 117% up to a maximum of 6% of an employee's plan-considered gross pay. All employee elective deferrals and all employer matching contributions made are fully vested.
Andeavor 401(k) Plan
The Andeavor 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. Mr. Goff participated in the Plan while employed at Andeavor. The purpose of the Plan is to assist employees in maintaining a steady program of 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
savings to supplement their retirement income and to meet other financial needs. Prior to the Plan's freeze, the Plan allowed eligible employees, such as Mr. Goff, to make elective deferral contributions to their plan accounts on a pre-tax or after-tax "Roth" basis up to a maximum of 50% of their Plan-considered gross pay and with such gross pay limited to the applicable Internal Revenue Code annual compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018). Employer matching contributions were made on such elective deferrals at a rate of 100% up to a maximum of 6% of an employee's plan-considered gross pay. The Plan also permitted discretionary employer "profit sharing" contributions in amounts determined by a participating employer. This discretionary contribution, calculated as a percentage of the employee's base pay based on a pre-determined target for the calendar year, can range from 0% to 4% based on actual performance. The profit sharing contributions for Mr. Goff were $5,500. Mr. Goff is fully vested in his Plan account. Effective at the close of December 31, 2018, the Andeavor 401(k) Plan was frozen as to new participants and as to further contributions.

 (c) As discussed in footnote (c) to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table, during 2018, certain awards held by Messrs. Heminger, Kenney and Goff vested for income tax and payroll tax (e.g., FICA taxes) purposes due to their retirement eligibility under the applicable plans and agreements. The net settlement withholding was: 
[END TABLE]
◦Mr. Heminger: 3,167 MPLX phantom units were withheld for such taxes as of December 20, 2018. Using the average of the high and low MPLX common unit prices on that date ($31.26), the taxes totaled $99,000. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Heminger had 75,655 vested, but as yet unpaid, MPLX phantom units.
◦Mr. Goff: 8,087 and 4,048 MPC restricted stock units were withheld for such taxes as of December 18, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan (Defined Contribution Portion)
Certain highly compensated non-officer employees and, prior to January 1, 2006, executive officers who elected not to participate in the Marathon Petroleum Deferred Compensation Plan (described below), are eligible to receive defined contribution accruals under the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan. The defined contribution formula in the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan allows eligible employees to receive employer matching contributions equal to the amount they would have otherwise received under the tax-qualified Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan were it not for Internal Revenue Code limitations. 
Defined contribution accruals in the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan are credited with interest equal to that paid in the "Marathon Stable Value Fund" investment option of the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan. The annual rate of return on this investment option for the year ended December 31, 2018, was 2.49%. All distributions from the plan are paid in the form of a lump sum following the participant's separation from service. 
Our NEOs no longer participate in the defined contribution formula of the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan; all nonqualified employer matching contributions for our NEOs now accrue under the Marathon Petroleum Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Marathon Petroleum Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Marathon Petroleum Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan (referenced in the "2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" table above as the "Marathon Petroleum Deferred Compensation Plan") is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
highly compensated employees. The Plan provides participants, including our NEOs, the opportunity to supplement their retirement savings by deferring up to 20% of their salary and bonus each year in a tax-advantaged manner.  Participant deferral elections are made in December of each year for amounts to be earned in the following year and are irrevocable. Participants are fully vested in their deferrals under the Plan. The Plan credits a matching contribution on a participant's deferrals equal to the match percentage under the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan, which is currently 117% of deferrals. The Plan also credits an amount to a participant equal to the employer matching contributions the participant would have otherwise received under the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan were it not for Internal Revenue Code limitations or any compensation limit imposed on deferrals under the Thrift Plan. Participants are fully vested in these matching contributions under the Plan. Plan participants may make notional investments of their notional Plan accounts from among certain of the investment options offered to participants under the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan, and participants' notional Plan accounts are credited with notional earnings and losses based on the result of those investment elections. Plan participants generally receive payment of their Plan benefits in a lump sum following separation from service.
Speedway Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Speedway Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. In prior years, Messrs. Heminger and Kenney actively participated in the Plan, but have not actively participated in the Plan in recent years (for example, Mr. Kenney has not actively participated in the Plan since 2013). During Messrs. Heminger's and Kenney's active participation, the Plan generally provided participants the opportunity to defer up to 25% of their salary and bonus each year in a tax-advantaged manner. Participants are fully vested in their deferrals under the Plan. In addition, the Plan provided benefits for participants, which were intended to be approximately equal to the employer matching contributions they would otherwise have received under the Speedway Retirement Savings Plan (which is now a component sub-plan of the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan) but which were not received because of plan limitations. Speedway matched each participant's deferrals under the Plan at the rate of $0.67 per dollar contributed on the first 6% of compensation deferred up to a maximum of 4% of the participant's eligible compensation. Participants are fully vested in these matching amounts under the Plan. The Plan also provided participants with the following types of non-elective employer contributions: (i) an employer non-elective contribution amount equal 3.5% of the participant's salary deferrals; and (ii) an employer non-elective contribution amount equal to 4% of the participant's eligible pay for employment retention purposes. Plan participants may make notional investments of their notional Plan accounts from among certain of the investment options offered to participants under the Marathon Petroleum Thrift Plan, and participants' notional Plan accounts are credited with notional earnings and losses based on the result of those investment elections. Plan participants generally receive payment of their Plan benefits in a lump sum following separation from service.
Emro Marketing Company Deferred Compensation Plan 
Messrs. Heminger and Kenney participated in the Emro Marketing Company Deferred Compensation Plan ("Emro Plan") while employed at Emro Marketing Company, a former MPC subsidiary. The Emro Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. The Emro Plan provided participants the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in a tax-advantaged manner. The Emro Plan was frozen to new participants and additional participant deferrals effective December 31, 2009. Amounts deferred by participants under the Emro Plan are credited with notional interest at the prime interest rate, adjusted quarterly, which was 4.25% for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The Emro Plan provides that participants will receive their benefits from the Emro Plan in a lump sum following separation from service. Messrs. Heminger and Kenney are fully vested in their notional Plan accounts.
Andeavor Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
The Andeavor Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Mr. Goff participated in the Plan while employed at Andeavor. During Mr. Goff's active participation, the Plan generally provided participants the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their base salary and/or up to 100% of their bonus compensation each year in a tax-advantaged manner. Also, the Plan matched participants' base salary deferrals dollar-for-dollar up to 6% of eligible compensation above the Internal Revenue Code annual compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018), and credited a discretionary profit sharing contribution in an amount up to 2% of each participant's Plan-considered compensation. Mr. Goff is fully vested in his notional Plan account. Plan participants may make notional investments of their notional Plan accounts from among certain of the investment options offered by Andeavor LLC to participants under the Plan, and participants' notional Plan accounts are credited with notional earnings and losses based on the result of those investment elections. Effective at the close of December 31, 2018, the Plan was 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   59 
[END TABLE]
frozen as to new participants and to cease additional credits (e.g., participant deferrals of compensation, and company contribution credits) to existing participants' notional Plan accounts for all periods after December 31, 2018; provided, however, that credits will be made for participants' existing deferral elections for Plan-considered compensation relating to 2018. Plan participants generally receive payment of their Plan benefits on the later of the January following separation from service or the first business day of the seventh month following separation from service, or, in certain circumstances, at a participant-elected date or no later than January 31, 2020.
Section 409A Compliance 
All of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which our NEOs participate are intended to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, distribution of amounts subject to Section 409A may be delayed for six months following retirement or other separation from service where the participant is considered a "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A. All of our NEOs are "specified employees" for purposes of Section 409A.

a Qualified Termination, Mr. Goff would also be entitled to receive a payment in the amount of $12,480,000 under the Andeavor Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, as further described below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Pension benefits for our NEOs are reflected in the "2018 Pension Benefits" table above. Amounts in this column represent additional pension benefits attributable solely to the final average pay formula in the respective plans. As Messrs. Heminger and Kenney attained age 65 in September 2018 and October 2018, respectively, they no longer are eligible for additional pension benefits, and their amounts for same have been reduced to zero. Messrs. Griffith and Templin are not eligible for additional pension benefits because they do not have any final average pay type benefit under the Marathon Petroleum Retirement Plan and the Marathon Petroleum Excess Benefit Plan. Amounts in this column for Mr. Goff represent additional pension benefits attributable solely to the final average pay formula under the Andeavor Pension Plan and the Andeavor Executive Security Plan. The additional pension benefits amount reported for Mr. Goff was calculated using the following assumptions: the present value is equal to the value of the normal retirement benefits under the Andeavor Pension Plan, adjusted to incorporate the enhancements listed below, at the earliest unreduced age assuming a discount rate of 4.22%, a cash balance interest crediting rate of 3.22%, the use of the RP-2018 Mortality Table with generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale MP-2018, and assuming the election of a lump sum payment at retirement using an interest rate of 4.22% and the PPA 2019 Mortality Table. The referenced enhancements are (i) final average pay is calculated using base salary in effect immediately prior to separation from service and the highest bonus paid during the three years immediately preceding the separation from service, but not less than the final average pay taken into account in the determination of the NEO's actual pension benefit, and (ii) the service used in determining the normal retirement benefit is equal to actual service for benefit accrual purposes plus three years (three years of additional age is also incorporated). 
(c) Vesting of stock options is accelerated upon retirement or a change in control with a Qualified Termination. Amounts shown reflect the value that would be realized if accelerated stock options were exercised on December 31, 2018, taking into account the spread (if any) between the options' exercise prices and the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($59.01).  
(d) For the NEOs other than Mr. Goff, vesting of restricted stock is accelerated upon a change in control with a Qualified Termination. Amounts shown reflect the value that would be realized if MPC restricted stock and MPLX phantom unit awards vested on December 31, 2018, taking into account the closing price of our common stock ($59.01) and MPLX common units ($30.30) on December 31, 2018.   
[END TABLE]
Certain of Mr. Goff's Andeavor equity awards and ANDX equity awards converted to MPC restricted stock units and ANDX phantom units, respectively, upon the Andeavor Merger and remain subject to their original vesting schedules. Amounts shown reflect the value that would be realized if these awards vested on December 31, 2018, taking into account the closing price of our common stock ($59.01) and ANDX common units ($32.49) on December 31, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(e) In the event of a change in control and a Qualified Termination, unvested performance units will vest and be paid out based on actual performance for the period from the grant date to the change in control date, and target performance for the period from the change in control date to the end of the performance cycle. Amounts reflect the MPC and MPLX performance unit target vesting amounts that would be payable in the event of a change in control with each performance unit having a target value of $1.00. 
(f) Includes 36 months of continued health, dental and life insurance coverage. In the event of death, life insurance would be paid out to the estates of certain of our NEOs in the following amounts: Mr. Griffith, $1.4 million; Mr. Templin, $1.8 million; Mr. Goff, $1 million.   
(g) Messrs. Heminger and Kenney are currently eligible to retire under our retirement plan, and Mr. Goff is eligible to retire under Andeavor's retirement plan; thus, amounts shown for them assume retirement rather than resignation. Messrs. Griffith and Templin were not eligible to retire as of December 31, 2018; thus, amounts shown for them reflect the compensation they would receive upon their voluntary resignation.  
(h) Andeavor experienced a change in control under the Andeavor Amended and Restated Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, as further described below, on October 1, 2018 as a result of the Andeavor Merger. Under the terms of his Letter Agreement with us, Mr. Goff has waived his ability under that plan to terminate his employment for good reason until October 1, 2019. Thus, assuming a hypothetical termination date of December 31, 2018, he would receive the cash severance shown, and his outstanding unvested equity awards would vest, only if his employment was terminated by us without cause.  
[END TABLE]
Retirement 
Our employees are generally eligible for retirement once they reach age 50 and have at least 10 years of vesting service with MPC or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Heminger and Kenney were retirement eligible. If an NEO retires on or after July 1 of the performance year, eligibility for a bonus under the ACB program is at our Compensation Committee's discretion. Upon retirement, our NEOs are entitled to receive their vested benefits that have accrued under our employee and executive benefit programs. For more information about our retirement and deferred compensation programs, see "Pension Benefits" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
In addition, upon retirement, unvested stock options held by our NEOs become exercisable according to the grant terms. Unvested restricted stock awards and MPLX phantom units are forfeited upon retirement (except in the case of a mandatory retirement at age 65, at which time they vest in full). For performance units, if an NEO has worked 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
more than nine months of the performance cycle, awards may be vested on a prorated basis at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (the MPLX Committee, in the case of MPLX performance units). If an NEO retires under our mandatory retirement policy, outstanding performance units will fully vest; however, payout will occur at the end of the full 36-month performance cycle based on the certified results of the performance cycle.
If an NEO retires on or after July 1 of the performance year, eligibility for a bonus under the ACB program is at our Compensation Committee's discretion. Upon retirement, our NEOs are entitled to receive their vested benefits that have accrued under our employee and executive benefit programs. For more information about our retirement and deferred compensation programs, see "Pension Benefits" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Goff was retirement eligible under the Andeavor Pension Plan, the results of which are described more fully under "Pension Benefits." In addition, his outstanding awards granted under the Andeavor 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Andeavor Logistics LP 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan generally vest pro rata based on the number of full months worked during the awards' original performance period once he became retirement eligible, which occurred on May 1, 2015.  
Other Termination 
We generally do not enter into employment or severance agreements with our NEOs, although we did enter into a Letter Agreement with Mr. Goff in connection with our acquisition of Andeavor, the pertinent terms of which are described below. An NEO whose employment is terminated by us without cause, or who terminates his employment with good reason, is eligible for the same termination allowance plan available to all other employees, which would pay a severance between eight and 62 weeks of salary based either on service or level of base salary. Such payments are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
Upon voluntary termination of employment by an NEO, or involuntary termination for cause, LTI awards, including vested but unexercised options, generally are forfeited unless provided otherwise in the applicable award agreement. Upon involuntary termination of an NEO without cause, vested options are exercisable for 90 days following the termination date. 
Our Letter Agreement with Mr. Goff provides that, following October 1, 2019, upon his voluntary resignation or retirement, or upon our termination of his employment without cause: (i) any unvested LTI awards (other than stock options) granted after October 1, 2018 will not be forfeited but will continue to vest in accordance with their terms, with any performance-based awards vesting based on actual performance; and (ii) any unvested stock options granted after October 1, 2018 will become exercisable according to their grant terms. In addition, upon Mr. Goff's voluntary termination of his employment for good reason, or upon our termination of his employment without cause, any unvested MPC stock options and restricted stock units Mr. Goff received as a result of the conversion of his Andeavor equity-based awards pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement with Andeavor would vest. The Letter Agreement also provides that, following October 1, 2019, Mr. Goff will be entitled to receive the benefits described under "Andeavor CIC Plan" below.
Change in Control 
Our NEOs participate in two change-in-control severance plans: the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Amended and Restated Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan ("MPC CIC Plan") and the MPLX LP Executive Change in Control Severance Benefits Plan ("MPLX CIC Plan"). While our NEOs participate in both plans, they are not entitled to receive benefits under both plans as a result of the same change-in-control event; rather, in the event of a change in control under both plans, our NEOs would receive the greater of the benefits provided by the plans. The plans are designed to pay benefits only upon a change in control and a Qualified Termination. A Qualified Termination generally occurs when an NEO separates from service from us and our affiliates in connection with, or within two years after, a change in control unless such separation is: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Due to death or disability;  
• For cause;  
• Voluntary, unless the NEO has good reason (defined as a reduction in the NEO's roles, responsibilities, pay or benefits, or the NEO being required to relocate more than 50 miles from his or her current location); or  
• On or after the date the NEO attains age 65.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   63 
[END TABLE]
MPC CIC Plan
Upon a change in control of MPC and a Qualified Termination, each NEO is eligible to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment of up to three times the sum of the NEO's current annualized base salary plus three times the highest bonus paid in the three years before the termination or change in control;  
• Life and health insurance benefits for up to 36 months after termination at the lesser of the current cost or the active employee cost;  
• An additional three years of service credit and three years of age credit for purposes of retiree health and life insurance benefits;  
• A cash payment equal to the actuarial equivalent of the difference between amounts receivable by the NEO under the final average pay formula in our pension plans and those that would be payable if: (i) the NEO had an additional three years of participation service credit; (ii) the NEO's final average pay were the higher of the NEO's salary at the time of the change in control event or Qualified Termination plus the NEO's highest annual bonus from the preceding three years (for purposes of determining early retirement commencement factors, the NEO is credited with three additional years of vesting service and three additional years of age); 
• A cash payment equal to the difference between amounts receivable under our tax-qualified and nonqualified defined contribution type retirement and deferred compensation plans and amounts that would have been received if the NEO's defined contribution plan account had been fully vested; and 
• Accelerated vesting of all outstanding MPC LTI awards.  
[END TABLE]
MPLX CIC Plan 
Upon a change in control of MPLX and a Qualified Termination, each NEO is eligible to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment of up to three times the sum of the NEO's current annualized base salary plus three times the highest bonus paid in the three years before the termination or change in control;  
• Life and health insurance benefits for up to 36 months after termination at the active employee cost;  
• An additional three years of service credit and three years of age credit for purposes of retiree health and life insurance benefits;  
• A cash payment equal to the actuarial equivalent of the difference between amounts receivable by the NEO under the final average pay formula in our pension plans and those that would be payable if: (i) the NEO had an additional three years of participation service credit; (ii) the NEO's final average pay were the higher of the NEO's salary at the time of the change-in-control event or Qualified Termination plus the NEO's highest annual bonus from the preceding three years (for purposes of determining early retirement commencement factors, the NEO is credited with three additional years of vesting service and three additional years of age); and (iii) the NEO's pension had been fully vested; and  
• A cash payment equal to the difference between amounts receivable under our tax-qualified and nonqualified defined contribution type retirement and deferred compensation plans and amounts that would have been received if the NEO's defined contribution plan account had been fully vested.  
[END TABLE]
NEOs who receive an offer for comparable employment from an acquirer or successor entity in the change in control will not be eligible to receive benefits under the MPLX CIC Plan.     
The MPLX CIC Plan also provides that NEOs who incur a Qualified Termination in connection with a change in control of MPLX or who separate from service with MPLX as a result of the change-in-control transaction (i.e., where the NEO remains employed with MPC but no longer provides services to MPLX) will become fully vested in all outstanding MPLX LTI awards. Performance units will vest and be paid out based on actual performance for the period from the grant date to the change in control date, and target performance for the period from the change in control date to the end of the performance cycle. In addition, if an NEO incurs a Qualified Termination, the NEO will become fully vested in all outstanding MPC LTI awards, provided that performance-based awards remain subject to the attainment of the applicable performance goals at the end of the performance cycle. 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Andeavor CIC Plan
The Andeavor Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan provides Mr. Goff with certain benefits following a change-in-control of Andeavor, which occurred when we acquired Andeavor on October 1, 2018. Our Letter Agreement with Mr. Goff provides that, following October 1, 2019, upon his voluntary or involuntary termination (other than his involuntary termination for cause) within two years following the change-in-control, he will be entitled to the following benefits under the plan:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment equal to three times his base salary and bonus; and 
• Continued medical benefits (excluding dental and vision benefits) for him and his eligible dependents for the 30-month period commencing on the termination date. 
[END TABLE]
The Andeavor CIC Plan was frozen on October 1, 2018, as a result of the change in control that occurred with respect to Andeavor on that date. No additional benefits may accrue under this Plan.
Death or Disability 
In the event of death or disability, our NEOs (or their beneficiaries) are entitled to the vested benefits they have accrued under our employee benefits programs. In the event of the death of an NEO during the ACB performance period, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, a target bonus will be paid. LTI awards immediately vest in full upon death, with performance units vesting at the target level. In the event of disability, LTI awards continue to vest as if the NEO remained employed for up to 24 months during the period of disability. 
CEO Pay Ratio
SEC rules require us to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer, Mr. Heminger, to the median annual total compensation of all our, and our consolidated subsidiaries', employees, other than Mr. Heminger. 
We included the following employees employed as of October 1, 2018 in our analysis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approximately 20,500 full-time regular, part-time, casual, and international employees of MPC, and  
• Approximately 14,000 part-time retail store associates and 26,100 full-time employees at our Speedway subsidiary.  
[END TABLE]
We excluded the following employees from our analysis:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As permitted by the SEC rules, we excluded for administrative convenience our non-U.S. employees, which fell below the 5% de minimis threshold for exclusion based on our total employee population of approximately 60,600. 
Mr. Heminger's annual total compensation: $ 19,806,050   
Median Employee annual total compensation: $ 27,730   
Ratio of CEO to Median Employee Compensation: 714   
[END TABLE]
Our Ratio in Context 
Our ratio may be relatively high when compared to other domestic U.S. refiners. This expected difference is largely due to our substantial retail operations (approximately 3,900 stores), staffed by approximately 40,000 employees, many of whom are part-time employees. We are the only entirely domestic downstream refining company with such a substantial retail presence. As our retail operations rely on a large labor pool of retail employees who work fewer hours and are compensated at lower levels, on a relative basis, than employees working in traditional downstream refining jobs, our median employee is likely not similar in terms of job function or compensation level to the median employee of other domestic U.S. refiners. In the interest of providing an additional disclosure that investors and other stakeholders may find meaningful, we have calculated an independent ratio that includes only MPC 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   65 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Mr. Heminger's annual total compensation: $ 19,806,050   
Median MPC Employee annual total compensation (excluding Speedway): $ 167,601   
Ratio: 118   
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee's Reflection on our Ratio 
Our Compensation Committee recognizes that we compete to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees in very different businesses. 
The Compensation Committee relies on market data and recommendations provided by the Consultant to structure variable pay opportunities (based largely on performance) for our NEOs, including Mr. Heminger, while management relies on competitive survey data, purchased from independent third parties, to determine competitive pay levels and bonus opportunities for other MPC and Speedway employees. 
The Compensation Committee also relies on the Consultant's assessment comparing Mr. Heminger's realizable compensation relative to his peers in the industry versus MPC's performance relative to its peers. This assessment determines whether our compensation programs appropriately align with our performance over a long-term period. The Compensation Committee has determined that Mr. Heminger's realizable compensation is strongly aligned with MPC's performance. 
We believe our pay practices across different business segments are competitive and appropriate to meet the needs of our workforce and the business. The Compensation Committee does not make compensation decisions with the intent to manage our ratio. It believes that to do so would deviate from market competitive pay practices and could adversely affect the competitiveness of our operations.

Proposal 3. Approval, on an Advisory Basis, of Named Executive Officer Compensation 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Although this vote is nonbinding, the Compensation Committee values your opinion and expects to consider the voting results when making future decisions about named executive officer compensation. 
Additionally, we think constructive dialogue with our shareholders provides meaningful feedback about specific named executive officer compensation practices and programs and encourage shareholders to communicate directly with both Company management and the Compensation Committee about named executive officer compensation. Shareholders may contact the Compensation Committee Chair to provide input on named executive officer compensation matters at any time by email at:
compchair@marathonpetroleum.com 
Shareholders may also contact management to provide input on named executive officer compensation matters at any time by contacting Kristina Kazarian, Vice President, Investor Relations, by email at:
ir@marathonpetroleum.com
As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement, our Compensation Committee has established executive compensation programs that reflect both Company and individual performance. Our Compensation Committee consistently exercises care and discipline in determining executive compensation, and has structured our executive compensation programs to attract, motivate, retain and reward talented executives, with a focus on delivering business results and value to our shareholders. 
We conduct annual advisory votes on named executive officer compensation. Following the vote at the Annual Meeting, we expect that the next advisory vote on our compensation of our named executive officers will take place at our 2020 Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 23 of this Proxy Statement, which describes in greater detail our compensation philosophy and programs, as well as the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and other related compensation tables and narrative beginning on page 44, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. The Board of Directors recommends you approve the following resolution: 
[END TABLE]
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to MPC's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our voting stock to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of our common stock or other equity securities. Based solely on our review of the reporting forms and written representations provided by the individuals required to file reports, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2018, our directors, executive officers and greater-than-10% beneficial holders filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a), except that a Form 3 underreported Mr. Goff's initial holdings of MPC common stock, and two transactions were not reported timely for Mr. Goff, in each case due to an inadvertent oversight regarding a small number of shares of MPC common stock held within certain managed accounts.

Related Party Transactions 
Policy and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions 
The Board has adopted a Related Person Transaction Policy to establish procedures for the notification, review, approval, ratification and disclosure of related person transactions. This policy is available on our website at www.marathonpetroleum.com by selecting "Investors" and "Corporate Governance," under the heading "Policies and Guidelines." Our intent is to enter into or ratify a related person transaction only when the Board, acting through the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, determines that the transaction is in the best interests of us and our shareholders. 
The material features of the policy are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On an annual basis, and at other times as circumstances require, directors, director nominees and executive officers must submit updated information sufficient for the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to identify the existence and evaluate possible related person transactions not previously approved or ratified. Known transactions with beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock are also assessed.  
• Any related person transaction that has not been previously approved or previously ratified must be submitted to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which considers whether ratification, amendment or termination of the related person transaction is in the best interests of us and our shareholders.  
• We may not hire any immediate family member of a director or executive officer unless approved by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. If an employee's immediate family member becomes our director or executive officer, no material change in that employee's terms of employment, including compensation, may be made without the prior approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.

Directors, Officers and Immediate Family Members 
Darla Burns, the sister of our Chairman and CEO, Gary R. Heminger, serves as a crude oil accounting supervisor for our wholly owned subsidiary, MPC LP. Ms. Burns has been employed by MPC LP or its affiliates for over 30 years. In 2018, she was paid compensation in the amount of $203,110. 
Relationship with MPLX 
As of February 15, 2019, we owned through our affiliates approximately 64% of MPLX's outstanding common units. We also own through our affiliates 100% of MPLX GP, which in turn owns the non-economic general partner interest in MPLX. MPLX GP manages MPLX's operations and activities through its officers and directors. In addition, Mr. Heminger is Chairman of the Board and CEO of MPLX GP, and Messrs. Griffith, Templin and Goff serve on the MPLX GP board of directors. Accordingly, we view transactions between MPLX and us as related party transactions and have provided the following disclosures with respect to such transactions during 2018. 
Acquisition and Restructuring Transactions
On February 1, 2018, pursuant to a Membership Interests Contribution Agreement entered into on November 13, 2017 by MPLX GP, MPLX, MPC Investment, and certain of their affiliates, MPC Investment contributed the membership interests in MPLX Fuels Distribution LLC and MPLX Refining Logistics LLC through a series of intercompany contributions to MPLX for $4.1 billion in cash, 111,611,111 MPLX common units and 2,277,778 MPLX general partner units. 
On February 1, 2018, pursuant to a Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement entered into on December 15, 2017 by MPLX GP and MPLX, MPLX GP cancelled its incentive distribution rights in MPLX and converted its 2% general partner interest in MPLX into a non-economic general partner interest, in exchange for 275,000,000 MPLX common units. MPC agreed to waive approximately one-third of the first quarter 2018 distributions on the common units issued in connection with this transaction.

Under our management services agreement, Hardin Street Marine LLC, an MPLX subsidiary, receives a fixed annual fee for providing oversight and management services for our marine business. This fee is adjusted annually for inflation and any changes in the scope of the management services provided. It expires on January 1, 2021, and automatically renews for two additional terms of five years each unless terminated by either party. 
Under our omnibus agreement, MPLX pays us a fixed annual fee for executive management services and general and administrative services, as well as any associated out-of-pocket costs and expenses. We have agreed to indemnify MPLX for certain matters, including environmental, title and tax matters.

On April 27, 2018, MPLX and MPC Investment entered into an amendment to the loan agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under the MPC Loan Agreement from $500 million to $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of all loans outstanding at any one time. The entire unpaid principal amount of the loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts (if any), will become due and payable on December 4, 2020. MPC Investment may demand payment of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts (if any), at any time prior to December 4, 2020. Borrowings under the loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. During 2018, MPLX borrowed $4.0 billion and repaid $4.3 billion, resulting in no outstanding balance at December 31, 2018. Borrowings were at an average interest rate of 3.473%. 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Relationship with ANDX 
We acquired Andeavor and its subsidiaries, including ANDX, effective October 1, 2018. As of February 21, 2019, we owned through our affiliates approximately 64% of ANDX's outstanding common units. We also own through our affiliates 100% of TLGP, which in turn owns the non-economic general partner interest in ANDX. TLGP manages ANDX's operations and activities through its officers and directors. In addition, Mr. Heminger is Chairman of the Board and CEO of TLGP, and Messrs. Griffith, Templin and Goff serve on TLGP's board of directors. Accordingly, transactions between us and our subsidiaries, including Andeavor, and ANDX and its subsidiaries, are related party transactions. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in the following discussion to "we" or "us" refer to Andeavor and its affiliates (other than ANDX and its subsidiaries) for events occurring through September 30, 2018, and to Andeavor LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, and its affiliates (other than ANDX and its subsidiaries), for events occurring on or after October 1, 2018. 
Acquisitions

Distributions and Reimbursements from ANDX 
In 2018, pursuant to its partnership agreement, ANDX made cash distributions to its unitholders, including us, of $493 million with respect to our limited partner interest.

Under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements, ANDX provides us transportation, trucking, terminal and storage services, and we provide ANDX minimum monthly throughput volumes of crude oil and refined products. Other than our trucking transportation services agreements, these commercial agreements generally have 10 year initial terms. 
Under our omnibus agreement, ANDX pays us a fixed annual fee for certain centralized corporate services, as well as all other direct or allocated costs and expenses we incur on its behalf. We have agreed not to compete with ANDX under certain circumstances, and to indemnify ANDX for certain matters, including environmental, title and tax matters and other liabilities related to assets we've contributed to ANDX. 
Under our secondment and logistics services agreements, ANDX pays us an annual service fee in exchange for our provision of certain operational services, such as communications, electricity, software services, security, fire and safety, maintenance and certain environmental services.

Interest will accrue on the unpaid principal amount of the loan at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the one-month term LIBOR for dollar deposits, plus (ii) a premium of 175 basis points (or such lower premium then applicable under ANDX's Credit Agreements). There were no borrowings on this loan during 2018 and no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2018.

Proposals 4-5. Shareholder Proposals
Proposal 4. Shareholder Proposal Seeking a Shareholder Right to Action by Written Consent
We have been notified that John Chevedden, whose address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, intends to present the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden has submitted documentation indicating that he is the beneficial owner of no less than 100 shares of our common stock.
We are not responsible for the contents of the proposal or supporting statement. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.
Shareholder Proposal and Supporting Statement
Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize a specific action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent according to applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for written consent.
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if small shareholders had the same access to independent corporate governance data on these companies as large shareholders.
Taking action by written consent in place of a special meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle and avoid the cost of a special meeting.
Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director. The following negative incidents indicate that director refreshment is needed:
Air Pollution/Gas Leak - Baltimore City: Lawsuit over alleged contribution to climate change July 2018
Air Pollution/Gas Leak - Rhode Island: Lawsuit alleging contribution to climate change July 2018
Air Pollution/Gas Leak - Canton, Ohio refinery: $250,000 penalty over alleged Clean Air Act violations March 2018
Anti-Competitive Behavior - Kentucky: Attorney General allegation of price-fixing and inflation during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 February 2018
Anti-Competitive Behavior - Kentucky: Attorney General lawsuit over alleged antitrust violations February 2018
Indigenous Community Rights - Dakota Access Pipeline: Violation of First Nations rights to consultation and free, prior, and informed consent in siting process February 2018
Air Pollution/Gas Leak - California: Lawsuits by cities and counties over alleged contribution to climate change January 2018
Environmental Impact Concerns - Southwest Detroit refinery: Residents proposed class action over alleged negative property and health impacts due to 2013 explosion January 2018
The expectation of this proposal is that shareholders will not need to make use of it because its mere existence will be an incentive factor that will help ensure that MPC is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management.
Please vote yes:
Increase Shareholder Rights to Include Action by Written Consent - Proposal 4
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Board of Directors' Response
The Board has carefully considered this proposal and unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST it. 
The Board believes that shareholder action by written consent is not necessary because shareholders currently have the right to call a special meeting. The Board amended our Bylaws in January 2018 to allow shareholders holding 25% of the Company's outstanding common stock to call a special meeting. The Board believes the 25% ownership threshold strikes the appropriate balance between allowing shareholders to vote on important matters that arise between annual meetings and protecting against the risk that a single shareholder or small group of shareholders could call a special meeting that serves only a narrow agenda not favored by the majority of shareholders. 
The Board also believes that a special meeting is a more appropriate method than action by written consent for shareholders to act between regular annual meetings, as a special meeting ensures that all shareholders receive notice, adequate time to review proposals and a forum for expressing their views. By contrast, shareholder action by written consent may not result in all shareholders receiving notice of a proposed action and does not permit a variety of views on a proposal to be exchanged. Action by written consent can also create confusion and disruption, as shareholder groups may solicit multiple written consents simultaneously, some of which may be duplicative or contradictory. The Board believes that matters of sufficient importance to warrant action between annual shareholder meetings should not be decided without notification to all shareholders and an opportunity for all shareholders to be heard and to vote at a meeting.
The Board believes this proposal should be evaluated in the context of the Company's overall corporate governance. The Board is accountable to our shareholders through a variety of policies and strong corporate governance practices, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy Access: Shareholders holding in the aggregate at least 3% of the Company's outstanding common stock may nominate directors to be included in our Proxy Statement, subject to satisfying certain procedural and eligibility requirements; 
• Shareholder Proposals: Shareholders may submit proposals for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and consideration at our annual meetings; 
• Special Meeting: As noted above, shareholders holding in the aggregate 25% of the Company's outstanding common stock have the right to call a special meeting; 
• Access to the Board: Shareholders may communicate directly with the Board, as described under "Communications with the Board of Directors" in this Proxy Statement; and 
• Voting Rights: Shareholders have the right to vote to elect directors and express their views on executive compensation and other proposals at an annual meeting, as well as the right to vote on certain special matters including mergers, large share issuances, the adoption of equity compensation plans and amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation. 
[END TABLE]
We have also eliminated supermajority provisions applicable to Bylaw amendments and have a majority vote standard, a director resignation policy, an anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy, a compensation recovery (clawback) policy, stock ownership requirements for officers, and no poison pill. 
Given the existing right of shareholders to call special meetings and our strong commitment to corporate governance, the Board believes that adoption of this proposal would not advance the Company's or shareholders' interests. 
Therefore, the Board recommends you vote AGAINST Proposal 4.

2019 Proxy Statement   75

Proposal 5. Shareholder Proposal Seeking an Independent Chairman Policy
We have been notified that United Steelworkers, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union ("USW"), whose address is 60 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, intends to present the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting. USW has submitted documentation indicating that it is the beneficial owner of 256 shares of our common stock.
We are not responsible for the contents of the proposal or supporting statement. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.
Shareholder Proposal and Supporting Statement
RESOLVED: Shareholders of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") urge the Board of Directors (the "Board") to take the steps necessary to adopt a policy to require that the Chairman of the Board be an independent director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the Company. The policy should be implemented so as not to violate any contractual obligations, with amendments to the Company's governing documents as needed. The policy should also specify the process for selecting a new independent Chairman if the current Chairman ceases to be independent between annual meetings of shareholders. Compliance with the policy may be excused if no independent director is available and willing to be Chairman.
Supporting Statement
CEO Gary Heminger has also been the Chairman of the Board since 2016. We believe that combining the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board both weakens the corporation's governance and places an undue burden on a single person. In our view, the Chairman should be an independent director, who has not previously served as an executive, in order to provide robust oversight and accountability of management, and to facilitate effective deliberation of corporate strategy, which we believe, is difficult to accomplish when the CEO serves as Chairman.
The Board is responsible for monitoring the CEO's performance, for providing objective guidance to the CEO and for determining the CEO's compensation. CEO Heminger's total compensation rose by close to 19% in 2017, the year after he was named Chairman of the Board. Having an individual chair the Board that is tasked with measuring his job performance and determining his compensation has the potential to weaken the Board's oversight and may lessen shareholder confidence. In addition, of great importance to any company's success is the value of external perspectives, which can be accomplished by having an independent Board. However, we believe that this benefit is nullified for the Chairman when he also serves as the CEO.
Our Company's 2018 $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor greatly increased the scope of our operations by adding 10 refineries, over 3,200 retail outlets and 11,000 miles of pipelines. Acquiring Andeavor has made our Company the nation's largest refiner. The CEO is responsible for overseeing our Company's strategic goals and ensuring that it meets corporate objectives. We believe that effectively integrating Andeavor's assets into our company requires the complete attention and guidance of the CEO, unencumbered by the additional requirements placed on the position of Chairman of the Board.
We do not believe that having a lead independent director is a sufficient alternative to an independent Chairman. In our view, an independent Chairman can increase investor confidence in our Company and provide for enhanced oversight of our CEO.
For these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution.
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Board of Directors' Response
The Board has carefully considered this proposal and unanimously recommends you vote AGAINST it.
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide the Board with the flexibility to exercise its business judgment on behalf of shareholders and choose the optimal leadership for the Board depending upon the Company's particular needs and circumstances. The independent members of the Board elect the Chairman and, as part of this election, review whether to combine or separate the positions of Chairman and CEO. When the CEO was elected Chairman, the independent directors elected a Lead Director from among themselves, whose responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presiding over all meetings of the Board in the Chairman/CEO's absence, including executive sessions; 
• Serving as a liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors; 
• Consulting with the Chairman/CEO on and approving meeting agendas, schedules and information sent to the Board; 
• Having the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; 
• Providing leadership to the Board in any situation where the Chairman and CEO roles may be perceived to be in conflict; and 
• Directly communicating with significant shareholders, as appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that Mr. Heminger is in the best position at this time to lead the Board of Directors as its Chairman due to his unique and in-depth knowledge of the history and growth of our Company, coupled with his industry expertise in key areas of strategic importance to our business. The Board has also determined that Mr. Rohr is in the best position to serve as the Board's independent Lead Director. The Board believes that this leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at this time because it strikes an effective balance between management and independent director participation in the Board process. Implementing this proposal would deprive the Board of its ability to organize and structure its functions in a manner that is most effective and in the best interests of shareholders at any given time.
While the Board agrees that a strong independent Board is necessary to represent our shareholders' interests, it disagrees that the combination of the Chairman and CEO positions impedes its ability to provide effective oversight of the CEO and management. The Board has implemented a number of structures and practices to enhance its oversight: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent directors comprise the overwhelming majority of the Board.  
• At each Board meeting, an offer is made for the independent directors to meet in executive session, and they did so nine times in 2018.  
• The Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees are comprised exclusively of independent directors.  
• The Compensation Committee annually reviews the Chairman/CEO's performance and establishes his compensation, the result of which is reviewed with the full Board, absent the Chairman/CEO. 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes it has embraced the need for independent oversight by structuring its leadership in a way that balances independent and effective leadership and oversight of risk while also maintaining a strong alignment with our long-term strategy. Given our strong independent Board oversight of the CEO and management, led by an effective independent Lead Director, the Board does not believe that a fixed policy requiring an independent Chairman is in the best interests of our shareholders.
Therefore, the Board recommends you vote AGAINST Proposal 5.

How do I know whether I am a shareholder of record or a beneficial owner of shares? 
If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, you are a shareholder of record with respect to those shares and you received the Notice or printed proxy materials directly from us. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you are the "beneficial owner" of such shares and the Notice or printed proxy materials were forwarded to you by that organization. In that circumstance, the organization is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct the organization how to vote the shares held in your account. 
May I change or revoke my vote? 
If you are a shareholder of record, whether you vote by telephone, Internet or mail, you can change or revoke your proxy before it is voted at the meeting in one of the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submit a new proxy card bearing a later date; 
• Vote again by telephone or the Internet at a later time; 
• Give written notice before the meeting to our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth on the cover of this Proxy Statement stating that you are revoking your proxy; or 
• Attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. Please note that your attendance at the meeting will not alone serve to revoke your proxy. 
[END TABLE]
Any change or revocation of your proxy must be received by the deadlines set forth in the question above or, for notice to our Corporate Secretary, before the meeting.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you must contact your broker or other intermediary with whom you have an account to obtain information regarding changing or revoking your voting instructions. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each proposal? 
Proposal 1. Our Bylaws include a majority vote standard for uncontested director elections. Because the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting, the election of each director nominee is uncontested and thus requires a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes "cast" and will have no effect on the outcome. 
Any Director nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast is required by our Bylaws to submit an irrevocable resignation to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, which will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action. The Board will, within 90 days following certification of the election results, publicly disclose its decision regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision. 
Proposal 2 will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions will not be considered votes "cast" and will have no effect on the outcome. Because the ratification of an independent auditor is a routine matter on which brokers may vote, there will be no broker non-votes with respect to this proposal. 
Proposal 3 will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes "cast" and will have no effect on the outcome. Although the advisory vote on this proposal is nonbinding, the Board will consider the results of the vote when making executive compensation decisions. 
Each of Proposals 4 and 5 will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against each proposal.
What are "broker non-votes?" 
The New York Stock Exchange permits brokers to vote their customers' shares on routine matters when the brokers have not received voting instructions from such customers. The ratification of an independent auditor is an example of a routine matter on which brokers may vote in this manner. Brokers may not vote their customers' shares on non-routine matters such as the election of directors or proposals related to executive compensation unless they have received voting instructions from their customers. Shares held by brokers on behalf of customers who do not provide voting instructions on non-routine matters are "broker non-votes."

What constitutes a quorum? 
Under our Bylaws, a quorum is a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted in determining whether a quorum is present for the meeting. 
Will any other matters be presented at the Annual Meeting? 
If any matters are presented at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals on the proxy card, the Proxy Committee will vote on them using their best judgment. Your signed proxy card, or Internet or telephone vote, provides this authority. Under our Bylaws, notice of any matter (including director nominations outside of our proxy access process) to be presented by a shareholder for a vote at the Annual Meeting must have been received by December 15, 2018, and must have been accompanied by certain information about the shareholder presenting it. 
How are proxies solicited and what are the costs of proxy solicitation?
We will pay the costs of this solicitation of proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, in person or by other means. They will not receive any extra compensation for this work. We have retained a professional proxy soliciting organization, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee not to exceed $18,500 plus reimbursement for certain expenses. We will also make arrangements with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of common stock, and we will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that they incur in connection with forwarding the material. 
When must shareholder proposals and director nominations be submitted for the 2020 Annual Meeting? 
In accordance with our Bylaws, shareholder proposals submitted for inclusion in our 2020 Proxy Statement must be received in writing by our Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on November 15, 2019. Notices of shareholder director nominations for inclusion in our 2020 Proxy Statement must be received by our Corporate Secretary on or after October 16, 2019, and no later than November 15, 2019, and must comply with our proxy access Bylaw provisions.
