 2019 ANNUAL MEETING   
 2019 ANNUAL MEETING   
[END TABLE]
Dear Fellow Motorola Solutions Shareholders: 
Since the opening bell rang at the New York Stock Exchange on January 4, 2011, beginning the trading of Motorola Solutions, total shareholder return through 2018 was 261%. During 2018 alone, total shareholder return was 30%. 
As fellow owners, we care a great deal about shareholder returns. But we also care that those returns are created in a sustainable way, and so I'd like to open this proxy statement with some context in that regard. 
We operate in an industry with relatively few environmental and social-issue risks, but many E&S opportunities: we help public safety and private-sector customers build safer communities by providing innovative emergency response communications, intelligent security solutions, and next generation 9-1-1 software. 
We have steadily reduced our already small energy, water and waste footprints by 19%, 25% and 29%, respectively since 2016. We conduct exceptionally strong social and environmental supply chain audits including over 156 supplier assessments conducted in 2018, covering 81% of our supply chain spend, based on our current reporting standards1. 
We are committed to providing a great work environment and competitive benefits for our more than 16,000 employees. In addition to great benefits and training programs, we offer a subsidized stock purchase plan so that our employees can have a stake in our future. We regularly win awards for being a good place to work and get top marks from the leading environmental, social, and governance scorecards for these and other employee matters. 
We have set ourselves apart when it comes to our focus on innovation. In 2018, we invested more than $630 million in R&D, we have approximately 5,300 granted patents, and we have a dedicated cybersecurity team working to protect our hardware, software and service solutions. We are committed to a sustainable future. We set tough goals and we back them up with investments in our portfolio, operations and people. 
At Motorola Solutions, our customers are everyday heroes—from police officers and firefighters to utility workers and educators. We are dedicated to designing and delivering the technologies our customers refer to as their lifeline—mission-critical communications, services, software, video and analytics, which keep businesses thriving and communities safe. 
We ask for your voting support to continue delivering results for you. We encourage you to communicate with us whenever you wish via the means described in this proxy statement, and we thank you for your investment in us. 
Sincerely, 
Gregory Q. Brown 
Chairman and CEO 
Motorola Solutions, Inc.

HOW OUR BOARD IS SELECTED AND EVALUATED 
As stated in our Board Governance Guidelines, when selecting directors, the Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee review and consider many factors, including: experience in the context of the Board's needs; leadership qualities; ability to exercise sound judgment; existing time commitments; years to retirement age; and independence from management. They also consider ethical standards and integrity. While the Company does not have a formal policy regarding diversity, gender and ethnic diversity is an essential factor considered by the Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee when selecting director nominees. The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee recognize the importance of a Board representing diverse knowledge and experiences and strive to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills, backgrounds and perspectives so that, as a group, the Board will possess the appropriate talent, skills, experience and expertise to oversee the Company's businesses. The Governance and Nominating Committee annually assesses the effectiveness of its director nomination process and the Board Governance Guidelines. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominees recommended by Motorola Solutions shareholders, provided that the recommendation contains sufficient information (as required by the Company's Bylaws), including the candidate's qualifications, to assess the suitability of the candidate, and is timely received in accordance with the Company's Bylaws. Shareholder-recommended candidates that comply with these procedures will receive the same consideration that other candidates receive. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee considers recommendations from many sources, including members of the Board, management and search firms. From time to time, Motorola Solutions hires search firms to help identify and facilitate the screening and interview process of director candidates. In 2018, we continued our retention of Russell Reynolds to assist with this process. Russell Reynolds compiles a list of candidates, evaluates each candidate and makes recommendations to the Governance and Nominating Committee. They screen candidates based on the Board's criteria, perform reference checks, prepare a biography of each candidate for the Governance and Nominating Committee's review and help arrange interviews if necessary. The Governance and Nominating Committee and the Chairman of the Board will conduct interviews with candidates who meet the Board's criteria. The Governance and Nominating Committee has full discretion in considering potential candidates and making its nominations to the Board.

Succession planning is important at all levels of the Company. In 2018, the Board reviewed short and long-term succession plans for the CEO and other members of management's executive committee. When assessing possible CEO candidates, the Board identified skills and behavioral characteristics they consider a requirement for the Company's CEO. The Board evaluates these succession plans with the overall business strategy in mind. When possible, potential leaders are introduced to the Board through presentations or separate events.

[END TABLE]
The Board oversees the business of the Company, including CEO and senior management performance and risk management, to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served. Each committee of the Board is also responsible for reviewing the risk exposure of the Company related to the committee's areas of responsibility and providing input to management on such risks. Management and our Board have a robust process embedded throughout the Company to identify, analyze, manage and report all significant risks facing the Company. Our CEO and other senior managers regularly report to the Board on significant risks facing the Company, including financial, cybersecurity, operational and strategic risks. Each of the Board committees reviews with management significant risks related to the committee's area of responsibility and reports to the Board on such risks, which includes the Compensation and Leadership Committee's review of Company-wide compensation-related risks and the Audit Committee's review of financial and cybersecurity risks. While each committee is responsible for reviewing significant risks in the committee's area of responsibility, the entire Board is regularly informed about such risks through committee reports and presentations to the entire Board. The oversight of specific risks by Board committees enables the entire Board to oversee risks facing the Company more effectively and develop strategic direction taking into account the effects and magnitude of such risks. The independent Board members also discuss the Company's significant risks when they meet in executive session without management. Our audit services department has a very important role in the risk management program. The role of this department is to provide management and the Audit Committee with an overarching and objective view of the risk management activities of the Company. Audit services identifies and conducts engagements utilizing an enterprise risk management model, with the engagements spanning financial, operational, strategic and compliance risks. The engagement results assist management in maintaining acceptable risk levels. The director of audit services reports directly to the Audit Committee as well as the Chief Financial Officer and meets regularly with the Audit Committee and its chairperson, including in executive session.

OUR BOARD'S LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
At the Annual Board meeting held in May 2011, the Board combined the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and appointed Gregory Q. Brown to serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and also appointed an independent director as Lead Independent Director. The Board reappointed Mr. Brown as Chairman of the Board and an independent director as Lead Independent Director at the Annual Board meetings held in 2012 through 2018. The Board determined that Mr. Brown's thorough knowledge of Motorola Solutions' business, strategy, people, operations, competition and financial position coupled with his leadership and vision made him well positioned to chair Board meetings and bring key business and stakeholder issues to the Board's attention. Our Lead Independent Director, currently Mr. Scott, chairs the executive sessions of the Board and acts as a liaison between our Chairman and independent directors. If elected at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Mr. Denman will serve as our Lead Independent Director, effective May 13, 2019.

Attendance at Board Meetings 
The Board held six meetings during 2018. Overall attendance at Board and committee meetings was 97%. Each incumbent director attended 100% of the combined total meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during 2018, except for one director that attended 93% and one director that attended 79% of such meetings. At the Board meetings, independent directors of the Company meet regularly in executive session without management as required by the Board Governance Guidelines and NYSE listing standards. Generally, executive sessions are held in conjunction with regularly-scheduled meetings of the Board. In 2018, the non-employee independent members of the Board met in executive session five times. In addition, Board members are expected to attend the Annual Meeting as provided in the Board Governance Guidelines. Eight of the directors who stood for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting attended that meeting. 
INDEPENDENCE 
On March 7, 2019, the Board made the determination, based on the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee and in accordance with our Director Independence Guidelines, that the current non-employee directors, Mr. Denman, Mr. Durban, Mr. Jones, Ms. Lewent, Mr. Mondre, Ms. Pramaggiore, Mr. Scott and Mr. Tucci, were independent during the periods in 2018 and 2019 that they were members of the Board. Mr. Brown does not qualify as an independent director because he is an Executive Officer of the Company. See Motorola Solutions' Relationship with Entities Associated with Independent Directors for further details. 
Determining Independence 
The Director Independence Guidelines include both the NYSE independence standards and additional independence standards the Board has adopted to determine if a relationship that a Board member has with the Company is material. We have adopted a stricter application of the NYSE independence standards requiring a look-back of four years when assessing independence in connection with a director's (i) status as an employee of the Company, (ii) direct compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000, (iii) relationship with our internal or external auditor, and (iv) employment with a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services. 
A complete copy of the Director Independence Guidelines is available on the Company's website at www.motorolasolutions.com/investors. 
Motorola Solutions' Relationship with Entities Associated with Independent Directors 
When assessing independence, each of Mr. Denman, Ms. Pramaggiore and Mr. Scott had relationships with entities that were reviewed by the Board under independence standards covering contributions or payments to charitable or similar not-for-profit organizations. In addition, each of Mr. Denman, Mr. Durban, Mr. Mondre, Ms. Pramaggiore, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Tucci had relationships with entities that were reviewed by the Board under independence standards covering payments to, or received from, other entities. In each case, the payments or contributions were significantly less than the NYSE independence standards or the Director Independence Guidelines adopted by the Board, or did not constitute a disqualifying event under such standards and were determined by the Board to be immaterial. 
Independent Members of the Audit, Compensation and Leadership and Governance and Nominating Committees 
The Board has determined that all of the current members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee are independent within the meaning of the Director Independence Guidelines, applicable rules of the SEC and the NYSE listing standards for independence. 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
The Company has established a written related person transaction policy and procedures (the "RPT Policy") to assist it in reviewing transactions in excess of $120,000 ("Transactions") involving the Company and its subsidiaries and Related Persons (as defined below). The RPT Policy supplements our other conflict of interest policies set forth in the Principles of Conduct for Members of the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Board of Directors, the Code of Business Conduct for employees and our other internal procedures. 
For purposes of the RPT Policy, a Related Person includes directors, director nominees and executive officers of the Company since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, beneficial owners of 5% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company and members of their respective immediate families. The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews all RPT Policy matters. 
The RPT Policy provides that any Transaction since the beginning of the last fiscal year is to be promptly reported to the Company's Secretary. The Secretary will assist with gathering important information about the Transaction and present the information to the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee will determine whether the Transaction is a Related Person Transaction and, if so, approve, ratify or reject the Related Person Transaction. In approving, ratifying or rejecting a Related Person Transaction, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider such information as it deems important to conclude if the Transaction is fair to the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Motorola Solutions had no Related Person Transactions in 2018. 
HOW YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OUR BOARD 
All communications to the Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board, the non-management directors or any individual director, must be in writing and addressed to them c/o Secretary, Motorola Solutions, Inc., 500 West Monroe Street, Chicago, IL 60661 or by email to boardofdirectors@MotorolaSolutions.com. Our Secretary reviews all written communications and forwards to the Board a summary and/or copies of any such correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or Board committees or that she otherwise determines requires the Board's or any Board committee's attention.
HOW WE DETERMINE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board the compensation for non-employee directors, which is to be consistent with market practices of other similarly situated companies and takes into consideration the impact on non-employee directors' independence and objectivity. The Board has asked the Compensation and Leadership Committee to assist the Governance and Nominating Committee in making such recommendations. The charter of the Governance and Nominating Committee does not permit it to delegate director compensation matters to management, and management has no role in recommending the amount or form of director compensation. 
HOW OUR DIRECTORS ARE COMPENSATED 
As of the May 16, 2017 Board meeting, non-employee director compensation was set as follows on an annual basis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Cash Compensation         Annual Compensation (paid quarterly)   
   Cash Compensation         Annual Compensation (paid quarterly)

   Equity Compensation         Annual Compensation (paid annually)   
[END TABLE]
During 2018, a director could elect to receive all or a portion of his or her annual cash retainer and other cash fees in the form of (i) deferred stock units ("DSUs") that settle when the director terminates service, (ii) DSUs that settle after one year (unless service is earlier terminated), or (iii) outright shares. Directors could also elect to receive the annual equity grant in the form of (i) DSUs that settle when the director terminates service, or (ii) DSUs that settle after one year (unless service is earlier terminated). These choices allow directors to engage in tax planning appropriate for their circumstances. Notwithstanding earlier settlement or receipt of shares, directors must hold all shares awarded or paid to them until termination of service from the Board. 
On May 15, 2018, each then non-employee director received a DSU award of 1,770 shares of Common Stock. The number of DSUs awarded was determined by dividing $190,000 by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant (rounded up to the next whole number) based on the closing price on the date of grant. For a non-employee director who becomes a member of the Board of Directors after the annual grant of deferred stock units, the award will be prorated based on the number of full months to be served until the next annual meeting of shareholders ($15,833.33 per month) divided by the closing price of the Common Stock on the day of election to the Board. 
Non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the Motorola Solutions Management Deferred Compensation Plan. Motorola Solutions does not have a non-equity incentive plan or pension plan for non-employee directors. Non-employee directors do not receive any additional fees for attendance at meetings of the Board or its committees, or for additional work done on behalf of the Board or a committee. The Company also reimburses its directors and, in certain circumstances, spouses who accompany directors, for travel, lodging and related expenses they incur in attending Board and committee meetings or other meetings as requested by Motorola Solutions. Mr. Brown, who was an employee during 2018, received no additional compensation for serving on the Board. 
The following table further summarizes compensation paid to the non-employee directors during 2018.

Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board stock ownership guidelines provide that non-employee directors are expected to own Common Stock with a value equivalent to at least five times the annual cash retainer fee for directors within five years after the date of joining the Board. In addition, directors are required to hold all shares paid or awarded by the Company until their termination of service. For the purposes of these guidelines, Common Stock includes deferred stock units. As of December 31, 2018, all non-employee directors were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. 
DIRECTOR RETIREMENT PLAN AND INSURANCE COVERAGE 
In 1996, the Board terminated its director retirement plan and no current non-employee directors are entitled to receive retirement benefits. In 1998, Mr. Scott, the only current director with an interest in the plan, converted his accrued benefits in the retirement plan into shares of restricted Common Stock. He may not sell or transfer these shares and these shares are subject to repurchase by Motorola Solutions until he is no longer a member of the Board because: (1) he does not stand for re-election or is not re-elected, or (2) of his disability or death. 
Non-employee directors are covered by insurance that provides accidental death and dismemberment coverage of $500,000 per person. The spouse of each such director is also covered by such insurance when traveling with the director on business trips for the Company. The Company pays the premiums for such insurance. The total premiums for coverage of all such non-employee directors and their spouses during the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,253.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2 — RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF  PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, following a competitive proposal process involving multiple firms. We are asking our shareholders to ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the appointment of PwC to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will have the opportunity to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. In the event shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee and the Board. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
KPMG LLP ("KPMG") was the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Representatives of KPMG are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. Services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by KPMG in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 are described under Audit Committee Matters—Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees. 
Former Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Company dismissed KPMG as its independent registered public accounting firm effective upon the issuance by KPMG of their reports on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 included in the filing of the 2018 Form 10-K.
The audit reports of KPMG on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, (i) there were no "disagreements" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years; and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
In accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, the Company provided KPMG with a copy of its Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that KPMG furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Company herein and if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of KPMG's letter dated May 17, 2018, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 17, 2018. 
New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
On May 14, 2018, the Audit Committee appointed PwC as its new independent registered public accounting firm, contingent upon completion of PwC's acceptance procedures. PwC's appointment will be for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and related interim periods. 
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted PwC regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED ON YOUR PROXY, YOUR SHARES WILL BE VOTED FOR THE RATIFICATION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP.

 PROPOSAL NO. 3 — ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The Board has adopted a policy providing for annual "say-on-pay" advisory votes. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board and Compensation and Leadership Committee will review and consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, below, for a detailed description of our executive compensation philosophy and programs. In particular, you should consider the following factors, which are more fully discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We actively engage our shareholders on their views and consider this input when designing our executive compensation  programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our programs are designed to pay for performance, so a majority of the NEOs' total compensation is based on the  performance of the Company and 100% of their long-term incentives are performance-based.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation program incorporates many leading practices to ensure ongoing good governance, including a  "clawback" policy, anti-hedging and anti-pledging, stock ownership guidelines and no excise tax gross-ups.  
[END TABLE]
For the reasons discussed above, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and other related tables and disclosures in this Proxy Statement." 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED ON YOUR PROXY, YOUR SHARES WILL BE VOTED FOR THE ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FROM COMPENSATION AND LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE CHAIR 
Thank you for your interest in, and support of, Motorola Solutions. As part of our efforts to respond to shareholder requests for more context and insight regarding the Compensation and Leadership Committee's compensation decisions, we have, for the first time, added a "Paying for Performance" section in the Executive Summary to emphasize the link between our strong performance and incentive payouts. Additionally, we highlight our responses to your feedback throughout the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
Our engagement with shareholders during last year's proxy season, and as a follow-on to the 2018 Say on Pay vote, resulted in changes to the Company's compensation program. Specifically, we have added more disclosure and structure around our Committee's ability to exercise informed discretion as it relates to assessment of performance results, eliminated cash from the CEO's long-term incentive awards and will reduce the portion of awards settled in cash for other NEOs beginning next year. We have increased the Committee's ability to use discretion in the event of negative share price trends and increased our CEO's equity holding requirements. Each of these changes was a response to shareholder input. 
We believe the Company's compensation program is performing as it should to incent efforts consistent with driving increasing levels of shareholder value and enhancing retention of key talent. We believe the best proof of this is the high quality of the management team that has emerged and in the results we've seen over the four-year period since the program was introduced. Motorola Solutions' total shareholder return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2018, 30% compared to -4%, and over the past three years, 79% compared to 30%. 
Sincerely, 
Anne Pramaggiore 
Compensation and Leadership Committee Chair 
SAY ON PAY VOTE RESULTS AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
HISTORICAL SAY ON PAY RESULTS 
The Compensation and Leadership Committee (the "Committee") strives to ensure our executive compensation program aligns with the interests of our shareholders and adheres to our pay-for-performance philosophy. Our executive compensation program, in place since 2015, has historically received very strong shareholder support (averaging over 96% approval from 2015 to 2017). With 2018's unusually low level of approval—69% shareholder support for our Say on Pay ("SOP") vote—we have taken concrete steps to understand and respond to our shareholders' concerns.

2018 SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Consistent with prior years, our shareholder engagement process in 2018 was multifaceted and continuous. Our efforts include monitoring trends, seeking expert input on pay practices and corporate governance, and engaging investors and shareholder groups on pay topics. We conduct targeted outreach efforts twice a year with shareholders, institutional investors and proxy advisory firms. 
Our shareholders' perspective is a critical input considered by the Committee for determining executive compensation. Given our lower SOP result, we enhanced our outreach efforts in 2018 to include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Spring: expanded outreach to more shareholders and included Committee Chair participation in the engagement process   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fall: focused outreach to solicit specific feedback from shareholders who voted against our SOP   
[END TABLE]
SPRING Answered questions and addressed concerns prior to the 2018 Annual Meeting Contacted top 50 shareholders (~70% ownership) Spoke with shareholders representing ~41% ownership FALL Collected feedback on the results of the 2018 Annual Meeting Contacted top 25 shareholders (~60% ownership) Spoke with shareholders representing ~14% ownership 
SUMMARY OF BOARD RESPONSIVENESS 
Overall, feedback from our shareholders was positive, recognizing the strength of our management team and their continued support of our performance-based programs. However, our shareholders also provided consistent feedback on how to improve aspects of our CEO's pay program and specific incentive program features.

When making compensation decisions, the Committee considers specific accomplishments in 2018, as well as how those accomplishments position us to execute against our growth and expansion strategy. 
PAYING FOR PERFORMANCE 
CEO Framework 
Individual performance objectives for Mr. Brown are established collaboratively with the Board and progress is reviewed throughout the year. When determining Mr. Brown's earned incentives and annual target compensation opportunities, the Board evaluates performance against four main categories. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Financial Goals—revenue, earnings per share and dividends  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Operational/Non-Financial Goals—backlog, customer experience and key  litigation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Strategic Initiatives—expansion of product and service offerings, more integrated solutions and acquisitions   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• People—organizational optimization, talent development and succession planning  
[END TABLE]
Specific accomplishments considered for 2018 with respect to these categories are listed in the "CEO Individual Performance" section. 
In recognition of the dynamic and broad-based range of Mr. Brown's responsibilities, we do not assign a specific weight to each category. The individual performance categories do, however, reflect the Committee's perspective that both current year results, as well as the quality of the foundation laid for future growth, are equally worthy of consideration. Additionally, the Committee reviews the momentum of the business—multiple year trajectory of key metrics—when reviewing Mr. Brown's performance. As a result, for example, the Committee looks at annual revenue and earnings growth as well as multi-year trends of these metrics, while also focusing on the Company's execution of pivotal acquisitions and the attraction of critical talent to the Company's growth areas. 
Short-Term Incentive Plan Results 
The STIP provides annual cash incentives to executives based on a combination of objective Company-wide financial performance targets and unique individual executive performance goals. Given the broad range of strategic activities necessary to execute the major transformation of our business, the Company performance factor is multiplied by an IPF to reward our executives for accomplishments beyond strong financial results. 
Company-Wide Financial Performance 
In 2018, we exceeded our operating plan for both non-GAAP OE and adjusted FCF, resulting in a Company performance factor of 1.09. The performance targets were set to incent 10% improvement in non-GAAP OE and 19% improvement in adjusted FCF.

1   Non-GAAP OE is our reported GAAP Operating Earnings excluding share-based compensation expense, reorganization of business  charges, intangibles amortization expense, environmental reserve expense, acquisition-related transaction fees, asset impairment, Avigilon purchase accounting adjustment, and loss on legal settlements.  
2   Adjusted FCF is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, but includes the $500  million voluntary debt-funded pension contribution in Q1 2018.  
[END TABLE]
CEO Individual Performance 
The Committee uses the IPF in the STIP to capture key qualitative and quantitative objectives important to the execution of annual contributions to our long-term strategies. Mr. Brown's IPF incorporates both his individual accomplishments and his role in supporting the accomplishments of his leadership team, for which he is accountable. 
Mr. Brown's 2018 IPF of 1.40 was derived from his accomplishments under the CEO framework. Highlights from his accomplishments in each category are provided in the table below.

[END TABLE]
In sum, the Committee has determined that Mr. Brown's performance warrants application of a 1.40 IPF. The 2018 financial performance set records for many metrics, for the second year in a row. Revenue, backlog, stock price appreciation and TSR were double digit increases. The pivotal Avigilon acquisition, set in motion in 2017 and closed in 2018, exceeded plan and expanded the Company's reach into video solutions and analytics. The contemplated VaaS acquisition further enhanced our video analytics and capabilities of our command center software suite. These results, as well as key talent acquisitions and reconfiguration of executive team responsibilities have given the Company not only its best year on record, but in the Committee's view, positioned the Company for future growth. 
Other NEO Individual Performance 
Other NEO individual performance objectives coalesce with Mr. Brown's objectives, as set by the Board. Mr. Brown evaluated the other NEOs' individual performance based primarily, but not exclusively, on the same categories in the CEO framework and made the following recommendations which were approved by the Committee. 
The below table includes highlights from each NEO's many accomplishments that contributed to the Company's success in 2018. For the purposes of this table, accomplishments have been ascribed to a specific category, though many of them impact multiple categories.

HOW WE PLAN COMPENSATION 
Our compensation framework is based on sound program design principles, which allow for the flexibility to competitively, but responsibly, address the dynamic labor markets in which we compete. These programs have been designed to focus executives on the achievement of our long-term business plan and shareholder value creation. Our incentive plans utilize rigorous financial goals and require above median relative outperformance for target payouts, while incorporating risk-mitigating features, such as payout caps, to ensure we reward sustainable growth. 
Over the years, our executive compensation program has evolved with our business strategy, incorporated feedback from our shareholders, and maintained market competitiveness to properly incent and reward our management team. Additionally, we conduct regular risk assessments of our compensation programs and practices and review results with the Committee at least annually. 
When setting annual compensation for our NEOs, the Committee balances the current state of the business with setting the stage for the future. The Committee, with assistance from their independent advisor, considers peer company pay practices for comparable positions; NEO experience, tenure, scope of responsibility and performance; internal pay alignment, and succession planning. The Committee uses the 50th percentile of our peer group and surveys as a guideline for establishing target total compensation opportunities for our NEOs. For 2018, each of our NEOs was between the market 50th and 75th percentile, with the exception of our highly seasoned CEO. 
The Committee engages an independent consultant, CAP, to advise on the Company's executive compensation strategy and program design and to provide regulatory and market trend updates. CAP carries out competitive reviews as directed by the Committee and provides input on specific compensation recommendations for our CEO and other members of management's EC. 
In 2018, the Committee continued to engage CAP as its independent compensation consultant. CAP participates in Committee meetings, including regular discussions with the Committee, without management present, to ensure impartiality on certain decisions. During 2018, the Committee also reviewed the independence of CAP using assessment criteria that aligned with the SEC and related NYSE rules adopted in 2012. The Committee concluded that CAP was independent and had no conflicts of interest. 
PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION STRUCTURE 
The performance-based structure for 2018 incorporates incentives that measure both short-term and long-term performance. In addition to base salary and an annual STIP award, this structure, shown graphically below (with incentives shown at their target amounts), includes an LTI award made up of our LRIP, POs and MSUs. The Committee believes a majority of compensation should be in the form of LTI to better drive alignment with shareholder interests and executive retention. 
2018 TALENT ACTIONS AND TARGET TOTAL COMPENSATION SUMMARY 
In 2018, several talent actions supported the continued transformation of our business, including: leadership alignment to our new reporting segments, development of our NEOs, and ongoing succession planning. In March, Mr. Molloy assumed the responsibilities for the newly acquired Avigilon business. Following Mr. Brda's retirement announcement in August 2018, Mssrs. Bonanotte, Molloy, Hacker and Mark each received additional responsibilities throughout the remainder of the year.

2018 ANNUAL COMPENSATION ELEMENTS 
BASE SALARY 
As the only fixed compensation element in our program, base salary is used to provide what we believe to be a baseline level of stability required to be market competitive. Salaries are reviewed and adjusted by the Committee as needed. Annual increases are not guaranteed or automatic. 
In March 2018, the Committee reviewed base salaries for our NEOs and applied market adjustments, where applicable. Throughout 2018, as a result of Mr. Molloy's new responsibilities leading Avigilon and product development, his base salary increased 16.2%. Due to Mr. Mark's material role expansion and promotion his base salary increased to $500,000. Mr. Brown has not received a base salary increase since 2014 and did not receive a base salary increase in 2018.

SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES 
The STIP is an annual cash incentive award based on the Company's achievement of financial performance and an executive's individual performance. The Committee sets the target value for STIP as a percentage of an executive's base salary. 
CEO Incentive Target 
For 2018, the Committee approved an increase to Mr. Brown's individual target award percentage from 150% to 175%. This is the first increase to Mr. Brown's target total cash since the Committee reduced his individual target award percentage from 220% to 150% in 2014. Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, and to recognize the improving company performance trajectory, due to the well-designed company transformation strategy, the change in 2018 target keeps the value of Mr. Brown's fixed pay constant, while increasing the performance-based pay opportunity.

[END TABLE]
NEO Incentive Targets 
The individual target award percentage for all other NEOs (95% of base salary) did not change in 2018. 
Additionally, as a result of Mr. Mark's promotion to EVP, Services & Software, his annual target award percentage increased to 95%, to be consistent with the annual target award percentages of the other NEOs. Mr. Mark's 2018 individual target award percentage has been prorated to reflect the timing of his promotion. 
Payout Formula 
Actual STIP awards are based on the executive's target incentive opportunity, the Company's achievement of performance results ("Business Performance Factor") and assessment of individual performance (IPF). The payout opportunity for both the Business Performance Factor and the IPF ranges from 0% to 140%, resulting in a total plan maximum payout opportunity of 196% of target. The incentive target opportunity for each NEO was determined based on a market evaluation.

Metric Selection 
For 2018, the Business Performance Factor was based on achievement of non-GAAP OE (weighted 65%) and adjusted FCF (weighted 35%) goals. Non-GAAP OE measures our profits from sales and adjusted FCF measures the cash available after capital expenditures. These are common performance measures both inside and outside of our industry and are fundamental inputs we use to measure profitability, business liquidity and rates of return for the business. We believe non-GAAP OE and adjusted FCF appropriately measure our annual business performance and ultimately drive our long-term shareholder value over time. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
Our LTI program, implemented in 2015, was designed with the specific intention of aligning the largest component of NEO pay to the achievement of exceptional and sustainable value creation for our shareholders during this pivotal transformation in our business. The LTI program achieves this through: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Determining Target Award Values 
The Committee reviews LTI target award values annually by first determining a target total compensation value appropriate for the size and complexity of the NEO's role and then determining the appropriate LTI value based on our philosophy of delivering the largest percentage of total compensation in LTI. The Committee also considers the 100% performance-based nature of our LTI program and how our Company's potential future performance has been impacted by the groundwork that has been set in the past year. As we continue to execute our long-term strategy through our Company's transformation, the Committee believes it is critical that each NEO's target opportunity appropriately reflects their contribution. 
When setting LTI target awards for 2018, the Committee considered the significant impact of Mr. Brown's decisions and actions on our longer-term business strategy and transformation. 
The Committee approved total target 2018 LTI at their March 2018 meeting.

  1  Mr Mark, who was elevated to the EC in August 2018, received   an annual equity grant in March 2018 comprised of time-vested stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") and a prorated LRIP.   
[END TABLE]
LTI Components 
The 100% performance-based LTI program includes the LRIP, POs and MSUs, each of which comprise approximately one-third of the total LTI mix. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The LRIP and POs are based on three-year TSR relative to the S&P 500. The payout scale for the LRIP and POs requires  our performance to exceed median performance of the S&P 500 companies before earning a target payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The LRIP and POs utilize a three-year performance period, with the earned portion of LRIP paid in equity for the CEO  and in cash for the other NEOs and earned POs vesting on the third anniversary of the grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If our TSR over the performance period is negative, but would still result in a ranking that would provide a payout, the  Committee has unlimited discretion to reduce the calculated LRIP payout (and number of POs vesting).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The TSR calculation uses a three-month average stock price at the beginning (three months preceding performance cycle  start) and end (final three months in performance cycle, plus the value of reinvested dividends) of the period for measurement purposes. This approach minimizes the impact of a single beginning and ending point stock price for each performance  cycle.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• MSUs are based on absolute stock price and provide a vehicle with further alignment to shareholders and one that supports  retention of our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each 1% increase/decrease in stock price results in a 1% increase/decrease in the number of MSUs earned at the end of the  performance period with a maximum payout at 100% stock price appreciation and a threshold of 40% stock price depreciation, below which no MSUs are earned.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The MSUs are earned and vest based on stock price appreciation/depreciation at the first, second and third anniversaries  of the date of grant with respect to one-third of the grant for each of the three concurrent performance periods.

SURVEY MARKET DATA 
To supplement our peer group data, the Committee also considers compensation surveys that include data from companies of similar size and business segments to Motorola Solutions. For 2018, the Committee considered data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, Willis Towers Watson High Tech Executive Survey and the IPAS Global High Technology Survey. 
EQUITY USAGE AND GRANT PRACTICES 
In 2013, we reduced our overall share usage (equity grants as a percentage of common shares outstanding) from our prior granting practices to more effectively manage our stock-based compensation expense and overall shareholder dilution. The expense from grants prior to 2012 made to a broader population was fully recognized by 2016. Our share granting practices have again evolved to meet the changing needs of our business and drive our growth. In 2018, significant acquisition activity required the issuance of equity as a key retention strategy to preserve enterprise knowledge and align our new employees' interests with those of our shareholders. 
In addition, at the 2015 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved the Motorola Solutions 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which was an amendment and restatement of the Motorola Solutions Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006 (the "Omnibus Plan"). This reduced the total number of shares reserved and approved for issuance by approximately 7 million shares, to 12 million shares. We plan to continue to closely manage our equity-granting practices to ensure our share usage and stock-based compensation expense remain in line with competitive levels.

We do not structure the timing of equity awards to precede or coincide with the disclosure of material non-public information. All equity grants made to Section 16 Officers and other members of the management team are approved by the Committee, with concurrence by the Board for grants to Mr. Brown. 
The Committee has also delegated authority to the most senior human resources executive to make off-cycle equity grants to newly hired or promoted employees, in recognition of outstanding achievement or for retention. These types of grants are made on the first trading day of each month.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
To ensure strong alignment of our senior management with the interests of our shareholders, the Company maintains stock ownership guidelines for our senior executives, including each of our NEOs. The Committee reviews compliance with the ownership guidelines annually. In the Committee's last review, it was determined that all NEOs had met their stock ownership requirement or are within the five-year achievement period. 
Our stock ownership requirements are expressed as a multiple of base salary as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer    6x    10x 
   Executive Vice Presidents and  Executive Committee Members    3x    3x 
   Senior Vice Presidents    2x    2x 
   Corporate Vice  Presidents    1x    1x 
[END TABLE]
Executives subject to the guidelines must meet their ownership requirement within five years from the date they first become subject to their applicable ownership requirement. Executives who do not meet their stock ownership requirement within five years must hold 100% of net shares acquired (net of tax withholding) on the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs or MSUs until compliance with the stock ownership requirement is achieved. Shares counted toward guideline achievement include directly owned shares, unvested RSUs and target MSUs. 
CHANGE IN CONTROL POLICY 
The Company maintains the Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Severance Plan"), which the Board has the ability to amend or terminate with at least one year's notice to participants. 
The CIC Severance Plan covers our NEOs (except for Mr. Brown, whose employment agreement contains change in control provisions) and our other senior executives. The Board considers the maintenance of an effective and stable management team essential to protecting and enhancing the value of the Company for the benefit of our shareholders. To that end, we recognize that the possibility of a change in control may exist and that this possibility, and the uncertainty and questions it may raise for certain senior executives, may result in the distraction, and potential departure, of senior management employees to the detriment of the Company and our shareholders. The CIC Severance Plan helps to encourage the continued attention and dedication of our senior management to their assigned duties without the distraction that may arise from the possibility of a change in control event. 
The CIC Severance Plan employs a "double trigger" in order for severance benefits to be paid, meaning that both a change in control event must occur and an executive must be involuntarily terminated without "cause" or must leave for "good reason" within 24 months following the change in control. 
The table below highlights key provisions of the CIC Severance Plan. For a detailed description of the CIC Severance Plan, please refer to the section "Change in Control Arrangements."

RECOUPMENT OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDS UPON RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL RESULTS 
If, in the opinion of the independent directors of the Board, the Company's financial results require restatement due to the misconduct by one or more of the Company's executive officers (including the NEOs), the independent directors may seek a number of remedies, all of which are subject to a number of conditions including (i) whether the executive officer engaged in the intentional misconduct, (ii) whether the bonus or incentive compensation to be recouped was calculated based upon the financial results that were restated, and (iii) whether the incentive compensation calculated under the restated financial results is less than the amount actually paid or awarded. The independent directors review whether to require one or more remedies by directing the Company to recover all or a portion of any incentive compensation received by the executive as a result of the misconduct, as well as cancel all or a portion of the outstanding equity-based awards held by the executive (commonly referred to as a claw-back policy). In addition, the independent directors may also seek to recoup any gains realized by the executive with respect to their equity-based awards, including exercised stock options and vested RSUs or MSUs, regardless of when they were issued. 
IMPACT OF FAVORABLE ACCOUNTING AND TAX TREATMENT ON COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESIGN 
Favorable accounting and tax treatment of the various elements of our total compensation program was an important, but not the sole, consideration in its design. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility of certain items of compensation paid to the CEO and certain other highly compensated executive officers (together, the "covered officers") to $1,000,000 annually, but in years prior to 2018 there was an exception to such limit for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation". Effective for 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended Section 162(m) to, among other things, extend the deduction limitation to the Chief Financial Officer and eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation, except for certain qualifying arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
The Company did not make any changes to its incentive plans in 2018 in an effort to maintain any tax deductions applicable due to "grandfathered" status under our existing plans. However, the Committee reserves the right to provide for compensation to executive officers that may not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m). In addition, because of the continued development of the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, we cannot guarantee that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m), as in effect prior to 2018, would or will in fact be deductible. 
SECURITIES TRADING POLICY: ANTI-HEDGING AND ANTI-PLEDGING 
Executives and certain other employees, including our NEOs, may not engage in any transaction in which they may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of our securities. Our securities trading policy is applicable to all employees and is designed to ensure compliance with all applicable insider trading rules. 
Directors, executives and certain other employees, including our NEOs, are not permitted to hold any security tied to the performance of our Common Stock other than equity delivered directly to employees under our equity incentive plans.

(5)  These grants are for the 2018-2020 LRIP. Awards under the 2018-2020 LRIP cycle are determined in dollars but, at the  discretion of the Committee, may be paid in cash or Common Stock. The Committee has determined that the 2018-2020 LRIP will be paid 100% in Common Stock for the CEO and 50% Common Stock, 50% cash for the other NEOs. For a discussion of the LRIP,  including the targets and plan mechanics, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The amounts under Threshold assume the minimum performance level necessary to generate an award was achieved. If final cycle performance is below the minimum  performance level at the end of the three-year cycle, awards will be $0. The amounts under Target assume the target level of performance is achieved. The amounts under Maximum will be payable if Motorola Solutions' three-year total shareholder  return ranks in the top 10th percentile among the S&P 500.

(6)  MSUs are granted at target on the grant date. Actual shares are earned and vest on the first, second and third anniversary  of the grant date based on stock price appreciation or depreciation. For every 1% increase or decrease in stock price, MSUs earned on the performance measurement date will increase or decrease by 1%. Maximum opportunity is 200% of the target award  for 100% stock price appreciation. Minimum opportunity is 60% of the target award at 40% stock price depreciation. On March 8, 2019, the first anniversary of the grant date, the Company's stock had appreciated by 31%; therefore, one-third of the target award was earned at 131%.  
(7)  POs are granted at target on the grant date. Actual options are earned and vest on the third anniversary of the grant date  based on the payout factor that corresponds with the Company's relative total shareholder return percentile rank amongst the S&P 500. Maximum opportunity is 250% of the target award if percentile rank is at least the 90th percentile. Minimum opportunity is 30% of the target award if percentile rank is at least the 30th percentile.

On March 9, 2018, the Company's total shareholder return percentile ranking in the S&P 500  resulted in the performance options paying out at 150% of target.  
  (12)  Performance Contingent Stock Options ("PCSOs") vested upon the attainment of each stock price hurdle as follows:  20% vested when the Company closing stock price was $85.00 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on June 30, 2017); 30% vested when the Company closing stock price was $102.50 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on  February 28, 2018); and 50% vested when the Company closing stock price was $120.00 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on July 24, 2018). The PCSOs became exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant. If any stock  price hurdles were not met during the three-year period, the corresponding unvested PCSOs would have expired.  
  (13)  These performance options vest on the third anniversary of the March 10, 2016 grant date based on a payout factor  that corresponds with our relative total shareholder return percentile rank among the S&P 500. Maximum opportunity is 250% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 90th percentile.  Minimum opportunity is 30% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 30th percentile. Table reflects target. On March 10, 2019, these POs vested at 250% of target.  
  (14)  These performance options vest on the third anniversary of the March 9, 2017 grant date based on a payout factor that  corresponds with our relative total shareholder return percentile rank among the S&P 500. Maximum opportunity is 250% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 90th percentile.  Minimum opportunity is 30% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 30th percentile. Table reflects target.  
  (15)  These performance options vest on the third anniversary of the March 8, 2018 grant date based on a payout factor that  corresponds with our relative total shareholder return percentile rank among the S&P 500. Maximum opportunity is 250% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 90th percentile.  Minimum opportunity is 30% of target award if percentile rank is at least the 30th percentile. Table reflects target.  
  (16)  Mr. Molloy's PCSOs vested upon the attainment of each stock price hurdle as follows: 44% vested when the Company  closing stock price was $85.00 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on June 30, 2017); 24% vested when the Company closing stock price was $102.50 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on February 28, 2018); and 32%  vested when the Company closing stock price was $120.00 for ten consecutive trading days (which was met on July 24, 2018). The PCSOs became exercisable on August 25, 2018. If any stock price hurdles were not met prior to August 25,  2018, the corresponding unvested PCSOs would have expired.  
  (17)  Mr. Brda's reported ownership is as of August 28, 2018, the date on which he ceased to be subject to the  reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

(2)  The "Value Realized on Vesting" is computed by multiplying the number of shares of stock or units by the market  closing price of the underlying shares on the vesting date. When an award vests on a non-trading day, the most recent previous market closing price is used for the purpose of this calculation.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION IN 2018 
The Motorola Solutions Management Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") previously allowed eligible executive participants the opportunity to defer portions of their base salary and annual cash incentive compensation and thereby defer taxes. Effective January 1, 2008, due to low participation, the Deferred Compensation Plan was closed to new deferrals. Effective June 1, 2013, the Deferred Compensation Plan was amended and restated to again allow eligible participants, including the NEOs, to defer portions of their base salary and cash incentive compensation otherwise payable in 2018. Motorola Solutions provides 100% matching contributions on up to 4% of eligible compensation deferred above IRS qualified plan limits ($275,000 in 2018), not to exceed $50,000 in the case of the NEOs. The Deferred Compensation Plan is not intended to provide for the payment of above-market or preferential earnings on compensation deferred thereunder; however, as described below and pursuant to SEC rules, all above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation in 2018 are shown below. Each of the NEOs participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2018.

The Deferred Compensation Plan uses the following funds as the index for calculating investment returns on a participant's deferrals. The investment fund choices mirror the fund choices available in the Motorola Solutions 401(k) Plan. The participant's deferrals into the Deferred Compensation Plan are deemed to be invested in one or more of these funds, as per the participant's election. The participant does not actually own any shares of the investment funds he selects.

Changes to distribution elections must be filed at least 12 months in advance of a previously elected payment start date. Any change will require that the payment start date be at least five years later than the previously elected payment start date. Hardship withdrawals are available, but no other nonscheduled withdrawals are available. Termination payments cannot be earlier than six months after separation from service, except in the event of death or, under certain circumstances, a change in control of the Company. 
RETIREMENT PLANS 
Our defined benefit pension plan was offered to eligible employees (including NEOs) hired before January 1, 2005. We offered the Motorola Solutions Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), a qualified pension plan with two different benefit formulas. Effective January 1, 2005, newly hired employees were no longer eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. Effective March 1, 2009, all future benefit accruals and compensation increases under the Pension Plan automatically ceased for all individuals who were participants as of February 28, 2009. In connection with the December 3, 2014 termination of our Pension Plan, a new pension plan was adopted with the same terms and conditions and the benefits for eligible employees have not changed. All references herein to the Pension Plan shall be deemed to refer to the new pension plan. 
The Company also offers a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which permits employee deferrals and provides for an employer matching contribution. 
Pension Plan 
The Pension Plan contains two benefit formulas, referred to as the Traditional Plan and the Portable Plan. The Traditional Plan formula provides an annual pension annuity benefit based on the participant's average earnings and benefit service, offset by an estimated age 65 Social Security benefit. The Traditional Plan formula is calculated either based on "final average earnings" and estimated Social Security benefit as of December 31, 2007, or "modified average earnings" as of February 28, 2009, whichever produces the higher benefit. The Portable Plan formula provides a lump-sum pension benefit based on the participant's average earnings, and a "benefit percentage" determined by the participant's vesting and benefit service. The Portable Plan also calculates a benefit based on "final average earnings" as of December 31, 2007 or "modified average earnings" as of February 28, 2009, whichever produces the higher benefit. 
A participant's "final average earnings" are his/her average earnings for the five years of his/her highest pay during the last ten calendar years (including years he/she did not work a complete year) of the participant's employment with the Company. A participant's "modified average earnings" are: (1) the sum of (a) his/her average earnings for the five (or fewer if hired after 2002) years of his/her highest pay during the ten calendar years before January 1, 2008, plus (b) his/her earnings during all years after 2007 in which he/she participated in the Pension Plan, divided by (2) the sum of (a) the number of years of the participant's benefit service under the Pension Plan prior to January 1, 2008, up to a maximum of five years (or fewer, if less than five); plus (b) the participant's total years of participation in the Pension Plan for all years after 2007. Eligible earnings include regular earnings, commissions, overtime, lump sum merit pay, and incentive pay with respect to the period January 1, 2000 to February 3, 2002. After February 3, 2002, incentive pay was excluded from the definition of eligible compensation. 
401(k) Plan 
The Motorola Solutions 401(k) Plan provides a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution each pay period on employee pre-tax and /or Roth after-tax contributions, up to the first 4% of eligible compensation. Employees are permitted to contribute up to 75% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax basis and up to 10% of eligible compensation as after-tax contributions, subject to IRS limits. The 401(k) Plan also offers a discretionary matching contribution, which shall be determined annually by a group comprised of certain Company officers and/or their designees.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
Employment Agreement with Gregory Q. Brown 
On August 27, 2008, the Company entered into an employment agreement (the "original employment agreement") with Gregory Q. Brown, then the Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chief Executive of the Company's Broadband Mobility Solutions business and a member of the Board. The original employment agreement memorialized Mr. Brown's existing base salary of $1,200,000, an annual bonus target of not less than 220% of salary, a long-range incentive award target of not less than 350% of base salary for 2008 and 250% thereafter, and a 2008 special bonus target. The original employment agreement had an initial three-year term, with automatic one-year renewals absent a notice of non-renewal. As previously disclosed on December 17, 2008, Mr. Brown voluntarily decided to forego any 2008 annual or special bonus under the Motorola Incentive Plan. The original employment agreement was amended on December 15, 2008, May 28, 2010 and March 10, 2014 (the original employment agreement, together with the amendments, are collectively referred to as the "employment agreement"). 
In the event of Mr. Brown's termination of employment "without cause" or by Mr. Brown for "good reason," Mr. Brown is entitled to: (1) accrued and unpaid obligations (including base salary, vacation pay and undistributed bonuses); (2) a lump sum severance payment equal to two times (prior to a change in control) or three times (on or within 24 months of a change in control) the sum of his base salary and target annual bonus; (3) a pro rata annual bonus based on actual performance during the year in which termination occurs; (4) two years (prior to a change in control) or three years (following a change in control) of medical insurance continuation; and (5) two years' continued vesting of all outstanding equity awards (prior to a change in control) or accelerated vesting of all equity awards (following a change in control). In the event the Company terminates Mr. Brown's employment for "cause" or Mr. Brown terminates employment without "good reason," he is entitled only to accrued and unpaid base salary and vacation pay. In the event of a termination of employment due to death or disability, Mr. Brown is entitled to accrued and unpaid obligations (including base salary, vacation pay and undistributed bonuses) and vesting of all then unvested equity awards that are outstanding at the date of termination. 
"Good reason" for Mr. Brown to terminate his employment and receive the above generally includes: (1) a reduction in salary, bonus targets, or benefits; (2) a failure to continue on the Board of Directors or negative change in reporting structure; (3) a relocation of employment beyond 50 miles of Schaumburg, Illinois; (4) the failure of the successor to what is now Motorola Solutions to assume the employment agreement; or (5) any other breach of the employment agreement. 
During his employment term, Mr. Brown is eligible to participate in the health and welfare plan, perquisites, fringe benefits and other arrangements generally available to other senior executives; Mr. Brown is required to use the Company's aircraft, if any, or Company arranged charter aircraft, for business and personal travel pursuant to the Company's security policy. Mr. Brown is not covered by the Company's change in control severance plans. Previously, Mr. Brown was entitled to a gross up for excise taxes on excess parachute payments, subject to a 10% "cut-back" (in other words, change in control payments will be reduced below the Code Section 280G safe harbor if the total payments are less than 10% in excess of the Code Section 280G safe harbor). However, Mr. Brown's employment agreement was amended on March 10, 2014 to remove the gross-up for excise taxes and to reduce the minimum annual bonus target to 150% effective in 2014. 
Mr. Brown's employment agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, including perpetual confidentiality obligations and employee non-solicitation and business non-compete provisions relating to the Company that apply during the employment period and the two-year period following termination of employment. 
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS 
Change in Control Arrangements 
The Company's 2011 Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Severance Plan") is applicable to the NEOs, other than Mr. Brown, as well as all officers who are at or above the level of Senior Vice President ("Senior Officers").

[BEGIN TABLE]
• qualifying participants are also entitled to receive a lump sum in cash equal to two times the participant's base  salary in effect on the termination date plus two times the participant's target annual bonus or sales incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• qualifying participants will also receive a pro rata target annual or sales incentive for the performance period (year,  quarter or month) in which the termination occurs;  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• qualifying participants will also receive continued medical, dental and life insurance benefits for up to two years at the  active employee premium rate, and two years of age and service credit for retiree medical eligibility; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the event a qualifying participant is subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, either (a) the  participant will pay all applicable Section 4999 excise taxes with respect to severance benefits (if such taxes apply) or (b) the severance benefits will be cut back to an amount that will not be subject to Section 4999 excise taxes,  whichever option is more favorable to the participant on an after-tax basis.  
[END TABLE]
If a Change in Control occurs during the term, the CIC Severance Plan continues for at least an additional two years from the Change in Control. The CIC Severance Plan may not be amended or terminated in a manner adverse to participants except upon one year's advance written notice. 
In addition to plans covering all of the Company's Senior Officers, there are Change in Control protections for the general employee population under the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Involuntary Severance Plan. 
Also, except as otherwise determined by the Compensation and Leadership Committee at the time of the grant of an award, under the Omnibus Plan, upon a Change in Control of the Company and a qualifying termination (known as a "double trigger"), all equity-based awards granted to employees, including our NEOs, become fully vested and exercisable; all performance goals are deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions are deemed met; all performance stock would be delivered as promptly as practicable; all performance units, restricted stock units and other units would be paid out as promptly as practicable; all annual short-term incentive awards would be paid out at target levels and all other terms and conditions deemed met; and all other stock or cash awards would be delivered and paid. The value of this potential acceleration of awards is the same as the value disclosed for the LRIP, stock options and SARs, and RSUs under the Involuntary Termination Change in Control columns of the Termination and Change in Control Table for 2017. A qualifying termination includes an NEO who is involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than "Cause") or quits for "Good Reason" within 24 months following the Change in Control. This treatment also applies for any awards that are assumed or replaced by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) if these awards preserve the value of existing awards at the time of the Change in Control and provide for subsequent payout in accordance with the same vesting schedule applicable to the original awards. With respect to any awards that are not assumed or replaced, such awards shall immediately vest. 
Executive Severance Plan 
The Company has maintained an executive severance plan for all U.S.-based elected officers and appointed vice presidents since October 1, 2008. On January 24, 2011, the Compensation and Leadership Committee approved and adopted the Company's 2011 Executive Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan"). The Executive Severance Plan is applicable to the NEOs, other than Mr. Brown, and is the Company's severance plan for officers of the Company at or above the level of Vice President ("Vice Presidents"), with additional eligibility for certain participants as set forth therein.

In particular, under the Executive Severance Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each participant is generally entitled to receive severance benefits if the participant's employment is terminated by  the Company other than: (a) for total and permanent disability; (b) for "Cause;" (c) due to death; (d) if the participant accepts employment with another company in connection with a sale, lease, exchange, outsourcing  arrangement or other asset transfer or transfer of any portion of a facility or all or any portion of a discrete organizational unit or business segment of the Company (or is offered employment under such circumstances with certain compensation and  benefits that are comparable to those provided by the Company when new employment would become effective); (e) if the termination of employment is followed by immediate or continued employment by the Company or an affiliate or subsidiary; or  (f) if the participant terminates voluntarily for any reason;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• qualifying participants who execute a prescribed release of claims, are not in breach of any covenants or other agreements  with the Company and comply with non-disparagement, confidentiality and other applicable covenants, are entitled to receive, in addition to accrued salary through the separation date, 12 months (or nine months  in the case of appointed vice presidents) of base salary continuation and a pro rata annual bonus or pro rata sales incentive, whichever is applicable, for the performance period (year, month or quarter, as applicable) in which separation occurs;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• qualifying participants would receive (a) 12 months (nine months in the case of appointed vice presidents) of  continued medical plan coverage at the active employee premium rate, (b) up to 12 months of outplacement services, or cash in-lieu thereof not to exceed the cost of such outplacement services, and  (c) a minimum of 12 months of financial planning services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any severance pay and benefits paid under the Executive Severance Plan are to be offset against any severance pay and  benefits payable under the applicable Change in Control plan and/or other individual severance arrangements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if a qualified participant receives a pro rata annual bonus or pro rata sales incentive under the Executive Severance Plan,  the participant is not to receive an annual bonus or sales incentive under any applicable plan for the same performance period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Compensation and Leadership Committee, or in some circumstances its delegate, may, in its sole discretion, reduce,  eliminate or otherwise adjust the amount of a qualifying participant's severance pay and benefits, including any bonus or incentive.  
[END TABLE]
If a Change in Control occurs, the Executive Severance Plan continues for at least an additional two years after the Change in Control. The Executive Severance Plan may not be amended or terminated in a manner adverse to participants or potential participants except upon one year's advance written notice or qualifying participants' written consent. 
Termination and Change in Control Tables for 2018 
The tables below outline the potential payments to our NEOs upon the occurrence of certain termination triggering events. Standard definitions for the various types of terminations follow the tables, although exact definitions may vary by agreement and by person. 
As required, the amounts included in the following tables reflect theoretical potential payouts based on the assumption that the applicable triggering event occurred on December 31, 2018. For each NEO, the columns included reflect the triggering events that were theoretically possible on December 31, 2018.

Mr. Brda's base salary is equal to $600,000, his short-term  incentive target opportunity under the STIP is equal to 95% of actual earnings and his long-term incentive target opportunity under the 2018-2020 and 2017-2019 LRIP cycles is equal to $250,000 and $437,501, respectively.  
(2)  Under Involuntary Termination-Not for Cause, severance is generally calculated as  12 months of base salary pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan. For Mr. Brown, severance is calculated as two times base salary plus two times target STIP award, as further discussed in Employment Agreement with Gregory Q. Brown. Under  Involuntary Termination-Change in Control, severance is calculated as two times base salary plus two times target bonus in the year of termination pursuant to the Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan, and pursuant to Mr. Brown's  employment agreement is calculated as three times base salary plus three times target bonus in the year of termination. Actual severance payments may vary. See Executive Severance Plan for further details.  
(3)  Assumes the effective date of termination is December 31, 2018 and that the payment is calculated pursuant to the  terms and conditions of the applicable arrangement or plan; the payment under the 2018-2020 LRIP cycle is equal to one-third of the target award and the payment under the 2017-2019 LRIP cycle is equal to two-thirds of the target award for Total and Permanent Disability or Death and the full target award for Involuntary Termination-Change in Control. If the NEO does not meet the rule of retirement under the STIP or  under the LRIP on the effective date of termination, zeroes are entered under Voluntary Termination-Retirement. If an NEO has not met the applicable rule of retirement, he is not automatically entitled to a pro rata payment under the LRIP in the  event of an Involuntary Termination-Not for Cause unless the LRIP cycle is in its final year at the time of termination.  
(4)  Assumes the effective date of termination is December 31, 2018 and the price per share of Common Stock on the date of  termination is $115.04 per share, the closing price of the Common Stock on December 31, 2018. If the NEO does not meet the rule of retirement, if applicable, under the equity plans on the effective date of termination, zeroes are entered under  Voluntary Termination-Retirement. For Involuntary Termination-Not For Cause, the vesting for unvested equity is pro rata accelerated for full months of service from the grant date to the termination date. For  Mr. Brown, under Voluntary Termination-Good Reason and Involuntary Termination-Not For Cause, equity continues to vest for a period of two years following termination. The value of dividend equivalent  shares on Mr. Brown's restricted shares is not included.  
(5)  Payments associated with Benefits and Perquisites are limited to the items listed. No other benefits or perquisite  continuation occurs under the termination scenarios listed that are not otherwise available to all regular U.S. employees.  
(6)  See Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018 for a discussion of nonqualified deferred compensation. There would be no  further enhancement or acceleration upon a termination or change in control.  
(7)  Health and Welfare Benefits Continuation is calculated as 12 months (except with respect to Mr. Brown, which is  calculated as 24 months per his employment agreement) as provided in the Executive Severance Plan under Involuntary Termination-Not for Cause and as 24 months (except with respect to Mr. Brown, which is  calculated as 36 months per his employment agreement) under Involuntary Termination-Change in Control. Mr. Brown's employment agreement also provides for 24 months benefits continuation under Voluntary Termination-Good Reason.   
(8)  Mr. Brown's employment agreement and our Senior Officer Change in Control Severance Plan use a "double  trigger." In other words, in order for severance benefits to be "triggered," (1) a change in control must occur, and (2) an executive must be involuntarily terminated for a reason other than "Cause" or must leave for  "Good Reason" within 24 months following the change in control. Mr. Brown's employment agreement has unique definitions of "Cause" and "Good Reason." The total amounts payable to the NEOs in the event of a  change in control of the Company may be subject to reduction under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
[END TABLE]
Definitions: 
"Voluntary Termination" means a termination initiated by the officer. 
"Voluntary Termination for Good Reason" occurs when, other than in connection with a Change in Control, employment is terminated by an officer for Good Reason. 
"Good Reason" means (1) an officer is assigned duties materially inconsistent with his position, duties, responsibilities and status, or his duties are materially diminished, during the 90-day period immediately preceding a Change in Control, (2) his position, authority, duties or responsibilities are materially diminished from those in effect during the 90-day period immediately preceding a Change in Control, (3) his annual base salary or total annual compensation opportunity are materially reduced, (4) the Company requires regular performance of duties beyond a 50-mile radius from the officer's current location, (5) the Company fails to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume and perform the relevant plan, or (6) any other material breach of the relevant plan. In the case of Mr. Brown, "Good Reason" also means (1) a failure to continue on the Board of Directors or a negative change in reporting structure, (2) Mr. Brown is not the sole Chief Executive Officer of Motorola Solutions on and after September 1, 2011, or (3) the failure of the successor to what is now Motorola Solutions to assume his employment agreement. 
"Voluntary Termination–Retirement" means, apart from any pension plan or STIP, for purposes of the awards under the Omnibus Plan prior to March 9, 2015 and the awards under the Motorola Solutions LRIP prior to February 11, 2015, retirement after reaching age 55 with at least 20 years of service, or age 60 with at least 10 years of service, or age 65; for purposes of awards under the Omnibus Plan on or after March 9, 2015 and awards under the LRIP, retirement after reaching age 55 with at least 10 years of service, or age 60 with at least 5 years of service, or age 65; for purposes of the STIP, retirement after reaching age 55 with 3 years of service; and for purposes of the Motorola Elected Officer Supplementary Retirement Plan, retirement after reaching age 60 (early retirement age for an unreduced benefit) or age 57 for a reduced benefit retirement, if applicable. 
"Involuntary Termination–Total and Permanent Disability" means termination of employment following entitlement to long-term disability benefits under the Motorola Solutions Disability Income Plan, as amended and any successor plan, or a determination of a permanent and total disability under a state workers compensation statute. 
"Involuntary Termination–For Cause" means termination of employment following any misconduct identified as a ground for termination in the Motorola Solutions Code of Business Conduct, or the human resources policies, or other written policies or procedures, including among other things, conviction for any criminal violation involving dishonesty, fraud or breach of trust or willful engagement in gross misconduct in the performance of the officer's duties that materially injures the Company. 
"Involuntary Termination–Not for Cause" means termination of employment for reasons other than "For Cause," Change in Control as defined below, death, Retirement or Total and Permanent Disability as defined above. 
"Involuntary Termination for Change in Control" occurs when, at any time (1) following a Change in Control and, assuming equity awards are not suitably replaced by a successor, prior to the second anniversary of a Change in Control or (2) during the 12 months prior to a Change in Control but after such time as negotiations or discussions that ultimately lead to a Change in Control have commenced, employment is terminated (a) involuntarily for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability or retirement under a mandatory retirement policy of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) by the officer after the occurrence of an event giving rise to Good Reason. For purposes of this definition, "Cause" means (1) conviction of any criminal violation involving dishonesty, fraud or breach of trust or (2) willful engagement in gross misconduct in the performance of the officer's duties that materially injures the Company, and "Disability" means a condition such that the officer by reason of physical or mental disability becomes unable to perform his normal duties for more than 180 days in the aggregate (excluding infrequent or temporary absence due to ordinary transitory illness) during any 12 month period. 
"Change in Control" (as used in the prior definition of "Involuntary Termination for a Change in Control") shall be deemed to have occurred if (1) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company, and no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of the "beneficial ownership," or changes therein, of the Company's securities by either of the foregoing), (2) there shall be consummated (a) any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the surviving or continuing corporation or pursuant to which shares of Common Stock would be converted into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Company in which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the merger have, directly or indirectly, at least a 65% ownership interest in the outstanding Common Stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, or (b) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company other than any such transaction with entities in which the holder of Common Stock, directly or indirectly, have at least 65% ownership interest, (3) the shareholders of the Company approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (4) as the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets, proxy or consent solicitation (other than by the Board), contested election or substantial stock accumulation (a "Control Transaction"), the members of the Board immediately prior to first public announcement relating to such Control Transaction shall thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board.

 CEO PAY RATIO 
[END TABLE]
Our CEO Pay Ratio, calculated in accordance with the requirements set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, is 211:1. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Material changes in our global workforce, largely driven by acquisitions, prompted the identification of a new median  employee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Brown's total annual compensation was $20,348,558 mostly due to our exceptional company performance resulting in  higher incentive payouts  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our new median employee's total annual compensation was $96,553  
[END TABLE]
Motorola Solutions is a global company with 15,306 employees, excluding the CEO, in 57 countries as of October 1, 2018. Our median employee was identified using the Company's global full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees employed on that date. As part of our methodology, and as permitted under the pay ratio rule, we excluded all employees in the following 18 countries (765 total employees excluded, which is 5.0% of our total workforce shown above): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Algeria      10   
 Argentina      43   
 Chile      400   
 Colombia      58

 Ukraine      4   
 Venezuela      1   
 Vietnam      3   
 Total Employees Excluded:      765   
[END TABLE]
We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 for the remaining employees. Annual base salary (converted to USD) and wages plus overtime were used as our consistently applied compensation measure to identify the median employee, and in doing so we annualized the compensation for our permanent full-time and part-time employees who were newly hired during 2018 and therefore not employed for the full measurement period. 
After identifying the median employee as described above, the median employee's total annual compensation was calculated in the same manner as for the NEOs in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table ("SCT") and the CEO's total annual compensation is the same as in the SCT.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
THE FOLLOWING "REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE" AND RELATED DISCLOSURE SHALL NOT BE DEEMED INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE BY ANY GENERAL STATEMENT INCORPORATING THIS PROXY STATEMENT INTO ANY FILING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY INCORPORATES THIS INFORMATION BY REFERENCE, AND SHALL NOT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED FILED UNDER SUCH ACTS. 
REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee (the "Committee") operates pursuant to a written charter that was amended and restated by the Board as of November 15, 2018. A copy of the Committee's current charter is available at www.motorolasolutions.com/investors. The responsibilities of the Committee include assisting the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities as they relate to the Company's accounting policies, internal controls, financial reporting practices and legal and regulatory compliance. The Committee also appoints and retains the independent registered public accounting firm. 
On March 7, 2019, the Board determined that each member of the Committee was independent within the meaning of relevant NYSE listing standards, SEC rules and the Motorola Solutions, Inc. Director Independence Guidelines. The Board also determined that (1) Mr. Jones, Ms. Lewent and Mr. Mondre are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules, whose expertise has been attained through relevant experience as discussed in "Our Board—Who We Are," and (2) each member of the Committee is "financially literate." 
The Committee fulfills its responsibilities through periodic meetings with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management. During 2018, the Committee met 9 times. The Committee schedules its meetings with a view toward ensuring that it devotes appropriate attention to all of its tasks. During certain of these meetings, the Committee meets privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, the chief financial officer, the director of internal audit, the chief ethics officer, the chief legal counsel and, from time to time, other members of management. Outside of formal meetings, Committee members had telephone calls to discuss important matters with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee also engages the independent registered public accounting firm to perform a review of the interim financial statements in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 100 and discusses the results of each review with the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Throughout the year, the Committee monitors matters related to the independence of KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm appointed for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. As part of its monitoring activities, the Committee reviews the relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company. After reviewing the relationships and discussing them with management, the Committee discussed KPMG's overall relationship with the Company, as well as KPMG's objectivity and independence. Based on its review, the Committee is satisfied with the registered public accounting firm's independence. The Committee also discussed with PwC matters related to its independence. 
KPMG also has confirmed to the Committee in writing, as required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding KPMG's communications with the Committee concerning independence, that, in its professional judgment, it is independent of the Company under all relevant professional and regulatory standards. The Committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the internal audit function's management, organization, responsibilities, budget and staffing. The Committee reviewed with both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors their audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks. 
The Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm all matters required by the standards of the PCAOB, including those described in Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees." With and without management present, the Committee discussed and reviewed the results of the independent registered public accounting firm's examination of the consolidated financial statements. The Committee also discussed the results of the internal audit examinations. The Committee reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the responsibility for the preparation and integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for the examination of those statements. Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. 
The Committee also reviewed management's report on its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Management is responsible for maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for auditing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and expressing an opinion thereon based on its audit. Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Committee recommended to the Board that management's report on its assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. 
As specified in the Audit Committee Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's consolidated financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. That is the responsibility of management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In giving its recommendation to the Board of Directors, the Committee has relied on: (1) management's representation that such consolidated financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and (2) the reports of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to such consolidated financial statements. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Judy C. Lewent, Chair 
Clayton M. Jones 
Gregory K. Mondre 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FEES 
On May 14, 2018 the Audit Committee appointed PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. There were no Audit or Audit-Related services rendered to the Company by PwC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018. 
KPMG served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The Audit Committee appoints and engages the independent registered public accounting firm annually and has appointed PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year. 
Fees Billed by KPMG 
The aggregate fees billed by KPMG for professional services to the Company were $6.4 million in 2018 and $7.1 million in 2017. The fees in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, the audit of internal controls over financial reporting, the review of the Company's quarterly financial statements, and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements are listed below under "Audit Fees." The fees for assurance and related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Company's financial statements, but not included under Audit Fees, are listed below under "Audit-Related Fees." Audit-Related Fees also include due diligence procedures performed in connection with merger and acquisition activities. Finally, the fees billed by KPMG for tax services, which primarily related to multi-national transfer pricing and tax services, are listed below under "Tax Fees." 
The following table further summarizes fees billed to the Company by KPMG during 2018 and 2017.

 Total     $6.4       $7.1   
[END TABLE]
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES 
In addition to retaining KPMG to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for 2018, KPMG and other accounting firms were retained to provide auditing and advisory services in 2018. The Audit Committee has historically engaged KPMG to provide divestiture and acquisition-related due diligence and audit services, audit-related assurance services, and certain tax services. The Audit Committee has further determined that the Company will obtain non-audit services from their independent registered public accounting firm only when the services offered by the firm are competitive with other service providers and do not impair the independence of KPMG. 
The Audit Committee Auditor Fee Policy requires the pre-approval of all professional services provided to the Company by KPMG. Below is a summary of the policy and procedures. 
The Audit Committee pre-approves the annual audit plan and the annual audit fee. The Audit Committee Auditor Policy includes an approved list of non-audit services that KPMG can provide, including audit-related services, tax services, and other services. The Audit Committee pre-approves the annual non-audit related services and budget. The Audit Committee allows the Company's Chief Accounting Officer to authorize payment for any audit and non-audit service in the approved budget. The Audit Committee also provides the Company's Chief Accounting Officer with the authority to pre-approve fees less than $100,000 that were not in the annual budget, but that are in the list of services approved by the Audit Committee. This approval is limited to a cumulative cap of $200,000 between Audit Committee meetings. This authority excludes approval over the annual integrated audit, internal controls over financial reporting services, and tax services. The Audit Committee Chair has the authority to pre-approve fees on the list of approved services, outside of the Chief Accounting Officer's allowable authorization, in advance of the Audit Committee meeting. The Chief Accounting Officer is responsible to report any approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee reviews, and if necessary, approves updated audit and non-audit services and fees in comparison to the previously approved budget at each regular Audit Committee meeting. 
In 2018, management did not approve any services that were not on the list of services pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Each director and certain officers of the Company are required to report to the SEC, by a specified date, his or her transactions related to our Common Stock. Based solely on a review of the copies of reports furnished to the Company or written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that, during the 2018 fiscal year, all reports required by Section 16(a) were timely filed by its officers and directors.

 PROPOSAL NO. 4 — SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL RE: "INDEPENDENT  DIRECTOR WITH HUMAN RIGHTS EXPERTISE" 
[END TABLE]
The Company has been advised that The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church or The Episcopal Church, beneficial owner of 40 shares, intends to submit the following proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. We have not modified the language of the shareholder's proposal. 
Independent Director with Human Rights Expertise 
WHEREAS, Motorola Solutions, Inc., a global corporation, faces increasingly complex problems as the international social and cultural context changes. 
Companies are faced with ethical and legal challenges arising from diverse cultures and political and economic contexts. Today, management must address issues that include human rights, workers' right to organize, non-discrimination in the workplace, protection of environment, and sustainable community development. Motorola Solutions itself does business in countries with human rights challenges including China, Singapore, Middle East, Israel and occupied Palestinian territories. 
We believe global companies must implement comprehensive codes of conduct, such as those found in Principles for Global Corporate Responsibility: Bench Marks for Measuring Business Performance, developed by an international group of religious investors (www.bench-marks.org). 
Human rights expertise at both management and board levels is critical to industrials companies' success because of significant issues associated with their operations. These impact shareholders, lenders, host country governments and regulators, as well as affected communities and indigenous peoples. Companies' ability to demonstrate policies and best practices reflecting internationally accepted human rights standards can lead to successful business planning or, if not in place, difficulties in raising new capital and obtaining the necessary licenses from regulators. 
We believe Motorola Solutions' Board of Directors would benefit by electing to its Board independent specialists versed in all business aspects of human rights. Just one authoritative figure with acknowledged expertise and standing could perform a valuable role in ways that would enable the Board to address more effectively the issues and risks inherent in its present business model regarding human rights. It would help ensure that the highest levels of attention are focused on developing human rights standards for new projects. 
RESOLVED, shareholders request that, as elected board directors' terms of office expire, the Motorola Solutions Board Nominating Committee nominate for Board election at least one candidate who: has a high level of human rights expertise and experience in human rights matters relevant to Company production and supply chain, related risks, and is widely recognized in business and human rights communities as such, as reasonably determined by the Board, and will qualify, subject to exceptions in extraordinary circumstances explicitly specified by the Board, as an independent director.* 
*A director shall not be considered "independent" if, during the last three years, she or he: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    was, or is affiliated with a company that was an advisor or consultant to Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    was employed by or had a personal service contract(s) with Company or senior management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    was affiliated with a company or non-profit entity that received the greater of  $2 million or 2% of its gross annual revenues from Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    had a business relationship with Company worth at least $100,000 annually;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    has been employed by a public company at which an executive officer of Company serves as a director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    had a relationship of the sorts described herein with any affiliate of Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    was a spouse, parent, child, sibling or in-law of any person described above.   
[END TABLE]
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST ADOPTION OF THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED ON YOUR PROXY, YOUR SHARES WILL BE VOTED AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROPOSAL. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and, for the reasons described below, believes adopting the shareholder proposal is unnecessary in light of the Company's existing policies and procedures. Moreover, the Company believes that as a matter of good governance, the Board's Governance and Nominating Committee should not be constrained in its assessment of which skills and experiences best serve the needs of the Board. 
As described in this proxy statement, our Governance and Nominating Committee considers a wide variety of skills, backgrounds and perspectives that, when taken together, provide the appropriate expertise to oversee the Company's business. Those qualifications include factors such as the ability to exercise sound judgment, be independent from management, and have high ethical standards and integrity. At the core of this approach is the belief that a Board should bring together a diverse set of skills and experiences that enable it to manage a large and complex organization in a manner consistent with the directors' fiduciary duty to the Company's shareholders. That set of skills must also be dynamic, and capable of adapting to shifting trends within the industry and corporate environment. Setting aside a specific seat for a director with human rights experience would, in our view, impede the ability of our Governance and Nominating Committee to nominate candidates that most benefit the Company as a whole. 
Our Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews the composition of the Board and its committees in order to determine whether additional directors with specific experiences or qualifications are in the best interest of the Company. The committee also, from time to time, engages outside search firms to assist in that effort. Further, the Company's Bylaws already provide an adequate means for recommending candidates for nomination. 
With respect to human rights matters, the Company already has in place a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that address human rights in our business. These policies and procedures, which are applied uniformly and consistently, are designed to ensure that the Company's global operations are conducted using high standards of integrity and ethical business conduct. 
The Company's policies include: the Motorola Solutions Code of Business Conduct, the Motorola Solutions Human Rights Policy, the Motorola Solutions Supplier Code of Conduct, the Anti-Human Trafficking Statement, the Anti-Human Trafficking Compliance Plan and the Motorola Solutions Environment, Health & Safety Policy. These specific policies are based upon internationally recognized human rights standards, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization, the United Nation's Global Compact, Social Accountability 8000 (SA 8000) standard, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
The Company has instituted a comprehensive trade compliance program that includes the screening of partners, customers and distributors to ensure the company is in compliance with restricted lists promulgated by the United States, United Nations, European Union and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 
The Board of Directors believes not only that the Company's policies effectively address the human rights matters described in the proposal, but also that the requested changes to the Company's director nomination process would be contrary to good governance practice. For these reasons and the others stated above, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the adoption of this shareholder-submitted proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL NO. 5 — SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL RE: "LOBBYING  DISCLOSURE" 
[END TABLE]
The Company has been advised that Mercy Investment Services, Inc., beneficial owner of 55 shares, intends to submit the following proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. We have not modified the language of the shareholder's proposal. 
Whereas, we believe in full disclosure of Motorola Solutions' (MSI) direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether MSI's lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and in the best interests of stockholders. 
Resolved, stockholders of MSI request preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.  Payments by MSI used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each  case including amount of payment and recipient.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    3.  MSI's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes  and endorses model legislation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    4.  Description of management's and Board's decision making process and oversight for making payments described in  sections 2 and 3 above.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to legislation or regulation. "Indirect lobbying" is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which MSI is a member. 
Both "direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at local, state and federal levels. 
The report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted on MSI's website. 
Supporting Statement 
We encourage transparency in MSI's use of corporate funds to lobby. MSI spent $17,366,262 from 2010—2017 on federal lobbying. These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where MSI also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, MSI had 141 lobbyists in 26 states in 2017 (http://www.followthemoney.org/), and MSI's lobbying in Florida has attracted media attention ("Motorola Solutions Awarded Statewide Law Enforcement Radio System Contract," Florida Politics, March 14, 2018). MSI's lobbying over Citizens Broadband Radio Service rules has also drawn scrutiny ("CII Groups, Motorola Continue to Lobby for Small Service Areas for CBRS Licenses," Radio Resources International, April 9, 2018). 
MSI belongs to the Business Roundtable (BRT), Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), which altogether spent $245,880,014 on lobbying for 2016 and 2017. Both the BRT and NAM are lobbying against shareholder rights to file resolutions. MSI does not comprehensively disclose its trade association memberships, nor payments and amounts used for lobbying on its website. Further, MSI does not disclose memberships in tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council. 
We are concerned that MSI's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. For example, MSI has committed to science-based targets in alignment with the Paris Agreement on climate change, yet the Chamber undermined the Paris climate accord. As shareholders, we believe that companies should ensure there is alignment between their own positions and their lobbying, including through trade associations. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST ADOPTION OF THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED ON YOUR PROXY, YOUR SHARES WILL BE VOTED AGAINST THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROPOSAL. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION 
The Board has considered the above proposal and believes that full implementation is not in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. The Company already discloses information about its lobbying, as required by existing law and regulations. Further, the Company offers greater transparency by providing additional information about government affairs, lobbying, and political contributions on its website as part of its annual Corporate Responsibility Report. 
The Company has many reasons to be engaged in the political process; it is subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels, its products are subject to government regulation, and it provides first responders with mission-critical communications equipment and services. The Company engages with public policymakers at all levels of government when it believes doing so will serve the best interests of the Company, its shareholders, its customers and the public. The Company is committed to participating in the political process as a good corporate citizen. In this regard, the Company has developed effective policies for the appropriate oversight and disclosure of its lobbying activities and is fully committed to complying with all laws governing lobbying activities, including laws requiring registration and reporting. 
Employees who engage in lobbying in support of the Company's objectives must first obtain approval from the Government Affairs organization ("GA"), after review of the scope of proposed lobbying activities, justification and applicable laws. Employees who wish to retain an independent contractor as a lobbyist must also obtain prior approval from GA and subcontracting by lobbyists is subject to further review. Lobbyists compensation must be commensurate with the value of the services provided by the lobbyist to the Company and contingent fee lobbying is discouraged. All lobbyists must enter into a signed consultant services agreement, subject to GA and legal counsel review, before representing the company. Because special lobbying rules may apply when the Company is seeking to do business with a government, GA conducts training on applicable laws and the Company's lobbying policies and processes for independent contractors and employees who engage in lobbying. GA is also responsible for ensuring that the Company and individual lobbyists acting on its behalf file all required reports, registrations, and disclosures in a timely manner. 
Under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, as amended, the Company submits quarterly reports outlining its federal lobbying activities, including lobbying expenditures for the quarter, the specific legislative items that were the topics of communications, and the individuals who lobbied on behalf of the Company. Those reports are available at: http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/ and http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/LDA_reports.htm. The Company files similar periodic reports with many state and local agencies reflecting its lobbying activities in those jurisdictions, which are also publicly available. 
Like most major corporations, the Company is a member of trade associations that represent its business priorities and which it believes can assist it in achieving its long-term strategic objectives. Although lobbying is not the primary purpose of many of those associations, the membership dues paid by the Company and other members may be part of the funds the associations use to engage in lobbying activities. Given the diverse membership in many of those associations, the Company may not agree with every public policy position and/or lobbying action taken by such associations. However, the primary purpose of membership in those trade associations is the policy, technical, and industry expertise they provide. The Company periodically reviews its association memberships, to evaluate alignment with the Company's goals and determine whether continued membership would be beneficial to the Company. The Company already discloses, as part of its Corporate Responsibility Report (http://responsibility.motorolasolutions.com/) the names of associations in the U.S. where annual dues are $50,000 or more. The Board believes that additional disclosure would not necessarily present an accurate reflection of the Company's positions on certain public policy issues. 
Efforts associated with legislative initiatives can provide insight into business interests, goals, and operations. Additional voluntary disclosure of such sensitive information beyond that compelled by law exposes the Company to competitive disadvantage by providing invaluable confidential and strategic information, at little or no cost or effort, to its competitors. Thus, requiring the Company to unilaterally expand its disclosure obligation will result in a wealth of business intelligence for competitors seeking to tip the scales in their favor, to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. 
By requiring expanded disclosure of lobbying activity, this proposal disregards the Company's existing policies and practices with regard to disclosure and compliance with the law. The Board believes the Company has robust policies and procedures in place relating to its lobbying activities, and therefore, this proposal is unnecessary. Furthermore, the Board believes this proposal is not in the best long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.

Holding Shares in the Name of a Bank, Broker or Other Nominee 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker, the broker, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote those shares in accordance with your instructions. Please check your voting instruction card or contact your bank, broker or nominee to determine whether you will be able to vote by Internet or telephone. If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker will be entitled to vote the shares with respect to "discretionary" items, but will not be permitted to vote the shares with respect to "non-discretionary" items (resulting in a "broker non-vote"). The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is the only "discretionary" item. The election of directors, the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation, and the shareholder proposals are "non-discretionary" items. 
Voting at the Annual Meeting as a Beneficial Owner 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee and want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to ask your bank, broker or other nominee to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the Annual Meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you. You will not be able to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting without a legal proxy. If you are provided a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the Annual Meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf. 
If you do not have a legal proxy, you can still attend the Annual Meeting with evidence of your stock ownership as of the record date; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote or instruct your broker to vote your shares in advance, even if you plan to attend. 
Changing Your Vote 
Registered shareholders can revoke their proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting another timely, later-dated proxy by Internet, telephone or mail;

Notice of Internet Availability 
The SEC has adopted rules for the electronic distribution of proxy materials. We have elected to provide our shareholders access to our proxy materials and 2018 Annual Report on the Internet instead of sending a full set of printed proxy materials to all of our shareholders. This enables us to reduce costs and lessen the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting by mailing most of our shareholders a Notice. If you receive a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request them by following the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. The Notice instructs you on how to access and review all of the information contained in the 2019 Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report. The Notice also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy over the Internet or by telephone. 
The Notice, which contains instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement, the form of proxy and the Company's 2018 Annual Report, is being mailed to shareholders on or about March 28, 2019. 
Other Matters at the Annual Meeting 
If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, and if you have voted your shares by Internet, telephone or mail, the persons named as proxies in your proxy will have the discretion to vote on those other matters for you. As of the date we filed this Proxy Statement, the Board did not know of any other matter to be raised at the Annual Meeting.

Also, the Company has retained Alliance Advisors, LLC to aid in soliciting proxies for a fee estimated not to exceed $27,500 plus expenses. The Company will, at its expense, request banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons. 
"Householding" of Proxy Materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies. 
As in the past few years, a number of brokers with accountholders who are Motorola Solutions shareholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice previously provided by these brokers to Motorola Solutions shareholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker or call 1-800-579-1639, email: sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or write us at Secretary, Motorola Solutions, Inc., 500 West Monroe Street, Chicago, IL 60661. 
Shareholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker. 
By order of the Board of Directors, 
Kristin L. Kruska
