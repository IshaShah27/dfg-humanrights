PROXY STATEMENT
Annual Meeting of Stockholders  May 2, 2019
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
The accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of Mueller Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for use at the annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at the Company's headquarters at 150 Schilling Boulevard, Second Floor, Collierville, Tennessee 38017 on Thursday, May 2, 2019, at 10:00 A.M. local time, or at any adjournment(s) thereof.
This Proxy Statement, together with the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, is first being mailed to stockholders on or about March 28, 2019. Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is providing access to its proxy materials over the Internet at http://www.proxyvote.com.
When a proxy card is returned properly signed, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the stockholder's directions appearing on the card. If the proxy card is signed and returned without directions, the shares will be voted for the nominees named herein and in accordance with the recommendations of the Company's Board of Directors as set forth herein. The discretion granted in the accompanying proxy card includes the authority to vote on all additional matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting as the persons named in the proxy deem appropriate. A stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by giving written notice to the secretary of the Annual Meeting or by casting a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by election inspectors appointed for the Annual Meeting. The election inspectors will also determine whether a quorum is present. The holders of a majority of the shares of common
Table of Contents stock, $.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), outstanding and entitled to vote who are present either in person or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. The election inspectors will treat abstentions as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and for purposes of determining the approval of any matter submitted. If a broker indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on a particular matter (i.e., a "broker non-vote"), those shares will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that matter, but will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on routine matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, without instructions from the beneficial owner of those shares; on the other hand, a broker may not be entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on certain non-routine items, such as the election of directors, and the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of the Company may solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise. The Company will reimburse brokers or other persons holding stock in their names or in the names of their nominees for their charges and expenses in forwarding proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of such stock.
VOTING SECURITIES
The Company had 56,624,732 shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on March 15, 2019, which are the only securities of the Company entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting. The record holder of each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019 will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws ("Bylaws") do not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors.
Table of Contents
On March 9, 2017, the Company paid a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") consisting of $3.00 in cash and $5.00 in principal amount of the Company's 6% Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the "Debentures") for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on February 28, 2017. In connection with the Special Dividend, in accordance with the Company's outstanding stock option plans and agreements, the Company adjusted the shares subject to and the per share exercise price with respect to outstanding options. This adjustment resulted in an increase in the number of shares subject to each outstanding option and an adjustment to the option purchase price designed to maintain the option holders' intrinsic value following issuance of the Special Dividend. References in this Proxy Statement to beneficial stock ownership or outstanding options for periods following March 9, 2017 reflect the equitable adjustment made to options outstanding on February 28, 2017.
PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS
As of March 15, 2019, the following parties were known by the Company to be the "beneficial owner" of more than five percent of the Common Stock:

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors proposes to elect the following nine persons, each as nominated by the Board of Directors, at the Annual Meeting to serve (subject to the Company's Bylaws) as directors of the Company until the next Annual Meeting (tentatively scheduled for May 7, 2020), or until the election and qualification of their successors: Gregory L. Christopher, Elizabeth Donovan, Paul J. Flaherty, Gennaro J. Fulvio, Gary S. Gladstein, Scott J. Goldman, John B. Hansen, Terry Hermanson and Charles P. Herzog, Jr. (collectively, the "Nominees"). If any such person should be unwilling or unable to serve as a director of the Company, which is not anticipated, the persons named in the proxy will vote the proxy for substitute nominees selected by them unless the number of directors has been reduced to the number of nominees willing and able to serve.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. "Plurality" means that the individuals who receive the greatest number of votes cast "For" are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the Annual Meeting. Consequently, any shares not voted "For" a particular director (whether as a result of a direction to withhold or a broker non-vote) will not be counted in such director's favor.
The Board of Directors has adopted a majority vote policy in uncontested elections. An uncontested election means any stockholders meeting called for purposes of electing any director(s) in which (i) the number of director nominees for election is equal to the number of positions on the Board of Directors to be filled through the election to be conducted at such meeting, and/or (ii) proxies are being solicited for the election of directors solely by the Company. The election of directors solicited by this Proxy Statement is an uncontested election. In the event that a nominee for election in an uncontested election receives a greater number of votes "withheld" for his or her election than votes "For" such election, such nominee will tender an irrevocable resignation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which will decide whether to accept or reject the resignation and submit such recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board of Directors no later than ninety (90) days following the uncontested election.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE THEIR SHARES FOR EACH OF THE NOMINEES.

Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors
During 2018, the Board of Directors held four regularly scheduled meetings and two special meetings. The Board of Directors established a standing Audit Committee and a Compensation and Stock Option Committee at its organizational meeting on February 13, 1991. On May 13, 1991, the Board of Directors created two committees (the "Plan Committees") to be responsible for administering the Company's 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Company's 1991 Incentive
Table of Contents
Stock Option Plan. On November 16, 1993, the Board of Directors established a standing Nominating Committee. On May 12, 1994, the Board of Directors created two committees to be responsible for administering the Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan and the Company's 1994 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, on February 12, 1998 created a committee to be responsible for administering the Company's 1998 Stock Option Plan and on February 12, 2002 created a committee to be responsible for administering the Company's 2002 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Option Plan Committees"). On February 12, 2004, the Board of Directors changed the name of the Nominating Committee to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
The Audit Committee is currently composed of three directors who are not officers or employees of the Company: Gary S. Gladstein (Chairman), Scott J. Goldman and John B. Hansen. Each member of the Audit Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to meet the standards for independence required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and applicable SEC rules. For more information on the NYSE standards for independence, see "Corporate Governance-Director Independence" in this Proxy Statement. The Board of Directors has further determined that (i)  all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and (ii) Gary S. Gladstein possesses accounting and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE, and therefore is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee (a)  appoints the Company's independent accountants, (b) reviews and approves any major change in the Company's accounting policies, (c) reviews the scope and results of the independent audit, (d) reviews and considers the independence of the accountants, (e) reviews the effectiveness of the Company's internal audit procedures and personnel, (f) reviews the Company's policies and procedures for compliance with disclosure requirements concerning conflicts of interest and the prevention of unethical, questionable or illegal payments and (g) makes such reports and recommendations to the Board of Directors as it may deem appropriate. The Audit Committee held six formal meetings during the last fiscal year, all of which were attended by the Company's independent auditors. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the scope and results of the annual audit and issues of accounting policy and internal controls.
Table of Contents
The Compensation and Stock Option Committee is currently composed of three directors who are not officers or employees of the Company: Gennaro J. Fulvio (Chairman), Scott J. Goldman and Charles P. Herzog, Jr. Each member of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to meet the NYSE's standards for independence. The Compensation and Stock Option Committee (i) provides assistance to the Board of Directors in discharging the Board of Directors' responsibilities relating to management organization, performance, compensation and succession and (ii) makes such recommendations to the Board of Directors as it deems appropriate. During fiscal year 2018, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee held four formal meetings.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is currently composed of four directors who are not officers or employees of the Company: Charles P. Herzog, Jr. (Chairman), Elizabeth Donovan, Paul J. Flaherty and Terry Hermanson. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to meet the NYSE's standards for independence. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the recommendation to the Board of Directors of director nominees for election to the Board of Directors. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending committee assignments and responsibilities to the Board of Directors, overseeing the evaluation of Board of Directors and management effectiveness, developing and recommending to the Board of Directors corporate governance guidelines, and generally advising the Board of Directors on corporate governance and related matters. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three formal meetings during fiscal year 2018.
The Board of Directors has currently implemented a leadership structure in which Mr. Christopher serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The Board has determined that having Mr.  Christopher serve in this dual capacity is in the best interest of stockholders at this time. The Company believes that this structure currently allows ultimate leadership and accountability to reside in a single individual, who has both extensive knowledge of the Company's business and critical relationships with the Company's customer base.
In order to coordinate the activities of the independent and non-management members of the Board of Directors, and to liaise between such directors and the Chairman of the Board, the Company has currently designated Mr. Hermanson to
Table of Contents serve as Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director's responsibilities are set forth in a formal charter, which can be obtained free of charge from the Company's website at www.muellerindustries.com or may be requested in print by any stockholder.
The Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect the Company. The full Board of Directors has retained the responsibility for general oversight of risks, but the Audit Committee primarily oversees those risks that may directly or indirectly impact the Company's financial statements. The Board of Directors receives reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company, as well as full reports by the chair of the Audit Committee regarding the Audit Committee's considerations and actions. The Board believes that through such open communication and access to information, it can sufficiently manage the risks facing the Company. The Board of Directors' administration of its risk oversight function has not affected the Board's leadership structure.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the purpose of defining independence, assigning responsibilities, setting high standards of professional and personal conduct and assuring compliance with such responsibilities and standards. The Company regularly monitors developments in the area of corporate governance. In July 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") which, among other things, established, or provided the basis for, a number of new corporate governance standards and disclosure requirements. In addition, following the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, the NYSE adopted changes to its corporate governance and listing requirements.
Director Independence
The standards relied upon by the Board of Directors in affirmatively determining whether a director is "independent," in compliance with the rules of the NYSE, are comprised, in part, of those objective standards set forth in the NYSE rules.
The Board of Directors, in applying the NYSE standards for independence, and after considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances, has affirmatively determined that the Company's current "independent" directors are: Elizabeth  Donovan, Paul J. Flaherty, Gennaro J. Fulvio, Gary S. Gladstein, Scott J. Goldman, John Hansen, Terry Hermanson and Charles P. Herzog, Jr. In the course of the Board of Director's determination regarding the independence of each non-management director, the Board considered for:

Compensation and Stock Option Committee
Independent Compensation Advisor
From November 2017 to March 2018, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee retained Willis Towers Watson ("Willis Towers") to review and advise regarding various provisions of the employment agreement between the Company and its Chief Executive Officer. The engagement of the independent advisory services of Willis Towers was made at the direction of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee in partial response to the results of the 2017 stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. The Compensation and Stock Option Committee did not utilize Willis Towers' services to benchmark executive compensation (or any component thereof) against any particular peer group.
During 2018, Willis Towers' aggregate fees in connection with advice relating to executive compensation were $16,392. In addition to providing services related to executive compensation in 2018, Willis Towers also provided non-executive compensation consulting services to the Company. The non-executive compensation consulting services provided by Willis Towers in 2018 included retirement advice, corporate risk and broking advice and health care consulting services. During 2018, Willis Towers' fees for these additional services were $312,973. Requests for non-executive compensation consulting services are made to Willis Towers by persons below the executive officer level within the departments of our Company that have a need for such services, and those requests are made without the involvement of our senior management or other personnel who may be associated with Willis Towers' engagement with executive compensation consulting.
The Compensation and Stock Option Committee assessed the independence of Willis Towers and, based on this assessment, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee determined that, given the nature and scope of these additional services, these additional services did not raise a conflict of interest and did not impair Willis Towers' ability to provide independent advice to the Compensation and Stock Option Committee concerning executive compensation matters.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and assesses the implementation and effectiveness of its diversity policy in connection with Board nominations annually to assure that the Board contains an effective mix of individuals to best advance the Company's long-term business interests.
Table of Contents
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not consider individuals nominated by stockholders for election to the Board. The Board believes that this is an appropriate policy because the Company's Bylaws allow a qualifying stockholder to nominate an individual for election to the Board, which proposal can be brought directly before a meeting of stockholders, as described below. In order for a qualifying stockholder to nominate an individual to the Board, written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination must be received by  the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal place of business (150 Schilling Boulevard, Suite 100, Collierville, Tennessee 38017) not less than 120 days and not more than (i) with respect to an election to be held at an annual meeting of stockholders, 150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting (unless the annual meeting date is advanced by more than thirty days or delayed by more than thirty days, in which case different deadlines apply) and (ii) with respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, not earlier than 90 days prior to the special meeting and not later than the later of (a) 60 days prior to such special meeting or (b) the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting, provided that in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by the Company at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it is delivered to the Secretary of the Company not later than the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company. To be a qualifying stockholder, the stockholder must be a stockholder of record at the time the notice was delivered to the Secretary of the Company. Each such notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or successor provisions) under the Exchange Act, including such
Table of Contents person's written consent to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder desires to be brought before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Company's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of Common Stock which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. See "Stockholder Nominations for Board Membership and Other Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting."
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal year 2018, Gennaro J. Fulvio, Paul J. Flaherty and Scott J. Goldman served on the Compensation and Stock Option Committee. No member of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee was, during fiscal year 2018, an officer or employee of the Company or was formerly an officer of the Company. In addition, no member of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee, during fiscal year 2018, had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company as a related party transaction under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. No executive officer of the Company served on any board of directors or compensation committee of any other company for which any of the Company's directors served as an executive officer at any time during fiscal year 2018.

Related party transactions may present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Company decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Management carefully reviews all proposed related party transactions (if any), other than routine banking transactions, to determine if the transaction is on terms comparable to terms that could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. Management reports to the Audit Committee and then to the Board of Directors on all proposed material related party transactions. Upon the presentation of a proposed related party transaction to the Audit Committee or the Board, the related party is excused from participation in discussion and voting on the matter.

Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders
It is the policy of the Company's Board of Directors to expect that all directors attend annual meetings of stockholders except where the failure to attend is due to unavoidable circumstances or conflicts discussed in advance with the Chairman of the Board. With the exception of Mr. Goldman, who was excused by the Chairman, all members of the Board of Directors attended the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Communication with the Board of Directors
Any stockholder or interested party who wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors, or specific individual directors, including the non-management directors as a group, may do so by directing a written request addressed to such directors or director in care of the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Mueller Industries, Inc., 150 Schilling Boulevard, Suite 100, Collierville, Tennessee 38017. Communication(s) directed to members of the Board who are not non-management directors will be relayed to the intended Board member(s) except to the extent that it is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate to do so pursuant to the procedures established by a majority of the independent directors. Communications directed to non-management directors will be relayed to the intended Board member(s) except to the extent that doing so would be contrary to the instructions of the non-management directors. Any communication so withheld will nevertheless be made available to any non-management director who wishes to review it.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides an overview of how our named executive officers were compensated in 2018, as well as how this compensation furthers our established compensation philosophy and objectives.
We believe in a pay for performance philosophy, such that a material portion of a named executive officer's compensation is dependent upon both the short-term and long-term strategic and financial performance of the Company, considered in light of general economic and specific Company, industry, and competitive conditions. For 2018, we continued to reward named executive officers in a manner
Table of Contents consistent with this philosophy by setting annual incentive targets based on the Company's achievement of a certain level of operating income. For the long-term component of compensation, we continued to grant equity awards, such that any long-term compensation opportunity will be directly tied to our stock performance. Moreover, as we have done since 2016, we included a performance criterion for vesting of a portion of the long term equity awards granted in 2018 to our named executive officers (other than Mr.  Millerchip). This feature is aimed at ensuring that any vesting of such grants is conditioned upon the Company's achievement of specified growth targets in either total stockholder return or diluted earnings per share.
Further, as explained in more detail below, our Compensation and Stock Option Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 to provide advice in designing and negotiating a new employment agreement for our Chief Executive Officer that would eliminate the "single-trigger" severance feature that certain of our stockholders identified as a cause of concern. These negotiations were ultimately successful and resulted in our entry into a new employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer on March 15, 2018 that, among other things, eliminated the single-trigger severance entitlement that existed under this prior agreement upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. Mr. Christopher's employment agreement is described in more detail below.
Compensation Policies and Objectives
In light of our pay for performance philosophy, we have designed our compensation programs for our executive officers to (i) reward our executive officers for the achievement of certain strategic and financial goals, (ii) align the long-term financial interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders, (iii) encourage our executive officers to continue their service with the Company, and (iv) provide a means to attract additional talented executive officers when necessary.
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, we held our annual non-binding stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation. Approximately 96% of our shares voted (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes) were in favor of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting.
Table of Contents
Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee will consider the outcome of this year's stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation as it makes future compensation decisions.
In accordance with the advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation submitted to stockholders at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2017, the Company will continue to hold a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of such votes which, in accordance with applicable law, will occur no later than the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2023.
Determination of Compensation
For 2018, compensation for our Chief Executive Officer was determined by our Compensation and Stock Option Committee. For 2018, compensation decisions for our other named executive officers were made by our Compensation and Stock Option Committee after consideration of the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee meets at least three times per year to determine all elements of our named executive officers' compensation, including base salary, annual incentive compensation, and long-term equity awards. Each element of compensation plays an important role in our compensation program, and we make compensation decisions regarding each element in the context of its effect on total compensation.
In determining the levels of compensation, we generally do not rely on formulaic guidelines but rather maintain a flexible compensation program that allows us to adapt components and levels of compensation to motivate and reward individual executives within the context of our desire to attain certain strategic and financial goals and control cost. This requires that we consider subjective factors including (i) an executive officer's performance against corporate objectives in recent years, (ii) the value of the executive officer's skills and capabilities in supporting the long-term performance of the Company, (iii) performance of each executive officer's specific management responsibilities, (iv) each executive officer's contribution as a member of the executive management team, and (v) whether each executive officer's total compensation potential and structure is sufficient to ensure the
Table of Contents retention of the executive officer when considering the compensation potential that may be available elsewhere. As such, we make reasoned subjective determinations about compensation levels.
In making compensation decisions, our Compensation and Stock Option Committee relies on the members' general knowledge of our industry, supplemented by advice from our Chief Executive Officer based on his knowledge of our industry in markets in which we participate. From time to time, we conduct informal analyses of compensation practices and our Compensation and Stock Option Committee may review broad-based third-party surveys to obtain a general understanding of current compensation practices.
In 2018, Mr.  Christopher's compensation was determined based on his management of the day-to-day activities of the Company and its subsidiaries. His incentive compensation was determined by the Company meeting specific adjusted operating income targets, as discussed below under the heading "Annual Incentive Compensation."
In 2018, Mr. Martin's compensation was determined based on his day-to-day management of corporate accounting, finance, credit, tax, investor relations and capital allocation initiatives. His incentive compensation was determined by the Company meeting specific adjusted operating income targets, as discussed below under the heading "Annual Incentive Compensation."
In 2018, Mr.  Millerchip's compensation was determined based on his management of the Company's European operations. His incentive compensation was determined by the Company meeting certain adjusted operating income targets, as discussed below under the heading "Annual Incentive Compensation."
In 2018, Mr. Moss's compensation was determined based on his management of our Trading products business. His incentive compensation was determined by the Company meeting specific adjusted operating income targets, as discussed below under the heading "Annual Incentive Compensation."
In 2018, Mr.  Sigloch's compensation was determined based on his strategic leadership of the Company's manufacturing activities, particularly its core brass rod and copper tube manufacturing. His incentive compensation was determined by the Company meeting specific adjusted operating income targets, as discussed below under the heading "Annual Incentive Compensation."
Table of Contents
Elements of Compensation
Our compensation program for our named executive officers is composed of six elements: (i) base salary, (ii) traditional benefits, (iii) annual incentive compensation, (iv) long-term equity incentive compensation, (v) perquisites, and (vi) post-employment and change-in-control compensation. Each element of compensation plays an important part in our overall compensation policies and objectives.
Base Salary and Traditional Benefits
We provide base salary and traditional benefits such as group health, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as matching contributions to our 401(k) plan, as a means of providing a base level of compensation for services performed, to encourage the continued service of our executive officers and to attract additional talented executive officers when necessary. Salaries paid to our named executive officers are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018. Base salary adjustments are determined by making reasoned subjective determinations about current economic conditions such as general wage inflation as well as the executive's qualifications, experience, responsibilities, and past performance. For 2018, Mr. Christopher's base salary was increased by 13.6% effective November 12, 2018; Mr. Martin's base salary was increased by 2.0% effective April 30, 2018, and by 9.7% effective May 14, 2018; Mr. Moss's base salary was increased by 2.5% effective April 30, 2018; Mr. Sigloch's base salary was increased by 2.0% effective April 30, 2018; and Mr. Millerchip's base salary was increased by 2.5% effective April 1, 2018.
Annual Incentive Compensation
Each of our named executive officers received annual incentive compensation in 2018, based upon the Company's actual performance for 2018 relative to the performance targets (as described below) established by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee on February 9, 2018.
For 2018, the amount of incentive compensation payable to each of our named executive officers was determined by multiplying (i) the named executive officer's actual base salary paid during 2018, (ii) the named executive officer's incentive grade level factor (125% for Mr.  Christopher; 90% for each of Messrs. Martin, Moss and Sigloch; and 75% for Mr.  Millerchip), and (iii) the named executive
Table of Contents officer's performance factor. The performance factor applicable to each of the named executive officers was determined based on the achievement level of the consolidated Company adjusted operating income target, as shown in the following table:
Table of Contents
As a result of 2018 performance, the annual incentive payments for the named executive officers, which are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018, equal the following percentages of each named executive officer's actual base salary paid during 2018: 162.5% for Mr. Christopher (125% grade level factor times a 130% performance factor); 117% for Mr. Martin (90% grade level factor times a 130% performance factor); 81% for Mr. Moss (90% grade level factor times performance factors of 130%, 0% and 100% weighted on a 50%-25%-25% basis respectively); 117% for Mr. Sigloch (90% grade level factor times a 130% performance factor)); and 97.5% for Mr. Millerchip (75% grade level factor times a 130% performance factor). In 2018, in addition to receiving annual incentive compensation, Mr. Moss received a discretionary bonus of $26,136. The discretionary bonus was paid in recognition of his outstanding service to the Company and leadership.
Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Program
Our long-term equity-based incentive compensation rewards our named executive officers for achievement of our long-term financial success as measured by our stock price. As such, it aligns the financial interests of our named executive officers with our stockholders and rewards our named executive officers for
Table of Contents increased stockholder value. Historically, we have granted restricted stock to our named executive officers, as discussed below. Generally, our equity incentive awards have been granted subject to three- or five-year vesting schedules, which we believe rewards outstanding service by our named executive officers and provides us with an effective mechanism to incentivize our named executive officers to achieve long-term financial success for the Company, to provide a strong retention incentive, and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the long-term interest of our stockholders.
Moreover, since 2016, we have added a performance criterion for vesting of a portion of the long term equity awards granted to Messrs. Christopher, Martin, Moss and Sigloch. The introduction of this feature was aimed at ensuring that any vesting of such grants is conditioned upon the Company's achievement of specified growth targets in either total stockholder return or diluted earnings per share over the reference period, which for the 2018 grants, was December 30, 2017 to the last day of the 2022 fiscal year. For this purpose, total stockholder return will be determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the 30-day trailing average closing price of a share of stock as of the applicable reference date, minus $35.91 (the 30-day trailing average closing price of a share of stock as of December 30, 2017), plus the value of any dividends and distributions paid during the reference period, by (ii) $35.91, and multiplying such amount by 100.
Long-term equity incentive awards to our named executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer (and in the case of Mr. Millerchip due to his residency in the United Kingdom, stock appreciation rights, which are treated as phantom shares for purposes of this Proxy Statement), are typically granted annually by our Compensation and Stock Option Committee based on the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. Long-term equity incentive awards to our Chief Executive Officer are granted annually based on the determinations of our Compensation and Stock Option Committee. In recent years, it has been the Company's practice to issue long-term equity incentive awards to certain executives and other employees in late July following release of the Company's second quarter and six-month operating results. In 2018, consistent with our historical practices, the named executive officers received annual grants in July 2018. In addition to Mr. Christopher's annual grant, the Compensation Committee determined to grant him a special performance-based restricted stock award in July 2018, in recognition of his outstanding service, leadership and commitment to the well-being of the Company. The Compensation
Table of Contents and Stock Option Committee has concluded that restricted stock awards (i) encourage key personnel to focus on sustainable long-term performance, (ii) strengthen the relationship between compensation and growth in the market price of the Company's common stock and thereby align management's financial interests with those of the stockholders and (iii) help attract and retain talented management personnel. In determining which named executive officers should receive restricted stock awards during 2018, and the size of these awards, our Compensation and Stock Option Committee made reasoned subjective determinations based upon the performance of the named executive officers, the importance of retaining their services, and their role in helping us work toward our long-term goals. There was no set formula for the granting of annual restricted stock awards to individual named executive officers or phantom shares to Mr.  Millerchip. In 2018, we granted shares of restricted stock to Messrs. Christopher, Martin, Moss and Sigloch covering an aggregate of 185,000 shares. In lieu of restricted stock, Mr. Millerchip received 13,000 phantom shares, which represent the right to receive a lump sum cash payment, as soon as administratively practicable following July 31, 2023, in an amount equal to (i) the product of (x) 13,000 and (y) the average of the highest and lowest trading prices for one share of the Company's common stock on July 31, 2023 (or, if July 31, 2023 is not a trading day, the trading day immediately preceding July 31, 2023) as reported on the principal national securities exchange on which the common stock is listed and traded on such date, plus (ii) the cash equivalent of any dividends paid in respect of 13,000 shares of common stock during the period commencing on August 1, 2018 and ending on July 31, 2023).
To foster retention, the 2018 equity-based awards generally vest over a five year period, subject to accelerated vesting on certain involuntary terminations and upon a change in control (as explained in more detail in the Grant of Plan Based Awards table below). The Compensation and Stock Option Committee elected to use a long-term vesting schedule, and included a performance based criterion for vesting with respect to certain of the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2018 to promote retention and to incentivize performance. Further, because total shareholder return and diluted earnings per share are metrics generally associated with stockholder value and long-term growth, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee determined to use those metrics as the underlying criteria for vesting of the performance-based long-term incentive awards. In addition, given the importance of long-term equity incentive awards in our compensation program, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee determined to provide for accelerated vesting to compensate our executive officers for their contributions to the Company
Table of Contents and to provide them with assurance that they will not be disadvantaged with respect to their equity awards in the event of a change in control or in connection with certain involuntary terminations of employment.
Perquisites
We offer certain perquisites to our named executive officers, which we view as an added element of our executive compensation program designed to attract, retain and reward our named executive officers. The perquisites we provided in fiscal year 2018 were as follows: estate and tax planning, certain club memberships, Company incentive trips, personal use of our Company airplane, and reimbursement of the income tax liabilities associated with certain perquisites. Estate and tax planning is provided to certain named executive officers to complement our various compensation elements for the purpose of ensuring the named executive officers understand the complexity of the long-term equity incentives and are thereby able to maximize the value of such benefits. We provide certain club memberships in part to facilitate networking with and entertainment of our business clients. Because of the nature of such memberships, our named executive officers gain some personal benefits. We offer Company incentive trips to reward top achievers in our organization. We maintain a Company-owned airplane primarily to provide efficient transportation to certain employees and customers for business travel. From time to time, when our plane is not being used for business purposes, we allow certain named executive officers to use the plane for personal travel.
2018 Compensation Decisions
As noted above, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee retained Willis Towers in November 2017, and worked with Willis Towers until March 2018, to review and advise regarding various provisions of the employment agreement between the Company and Mr.  Christopher. The engagement of the independent advisory services of Willis Towers was made at the direction of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee in partial response to the results of the 2017 stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. The Compensation and Stock Option Committee did not utilize Willis Towers' services to benchmark executive compensation (or any component thereof) against any particular peer group.
Table of Contents
On March 15, 2018, in response to the feedback we have received from our stockholders, we entered into an indefinite term employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Mr. Christopher, pursuant to which he will continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reporting directly to the Board. The Employment Agreement eliminates the "single-trigger" severance to which Mr. Christopher would have been entitled upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company under the prior employment agreement. In consideration for the payments and benefits provided under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Christopher agreed to be subject to certain restrictive covenants during the term of his employment and thereafter, including customary non-compete restrictions that apply for one year post-termination and customary non-solicitation restrictions with respect to current and prospective employees that apply for one year post-termination. In addition, during the term of his employment and for one year thereafter, Mr. Christopher is prohibited from contacting any customer or prospective customer of the Company, or any representative of the same, for the purpose of providing any service or product competitive with any service or product sold or provided by the Company.
Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain executive officers, subject historically to an exception for qualifying "performance-based compensation." The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, substantially modified Section 162(m) of the Code and, among other things, eliminated the performance-based exception to the $1,000,000 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018. As a result, as of 2018, compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 million is nondeductible, whether or not it is performance-based. In addition, beginning in 2018, the executive officers subject to Section 162(m) of the Code (the "Covered Employees") will include any individual who served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) for the taxable year, and once an individual becomes a Covered Employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will remain a Covered Employee for all future years, including following any termination of employment.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) of the Code described above will not apply to compensation
Table of Contents payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not materially modified after that date. To the extent applicable to our existing contracts and awards, we may avail ourselves of this transition rule. However, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition rule, no assurances can be given at this time that our existing contracts and awards, even if in place on November 2, 2017, will meet the requirements of the transition rule. Moreover, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the company, we do not limit our actions with respect to executive compensation to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code if we determine that doing so is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Compensation Risk Management
In establishing compensation programs for the Company's executive officers and non-executive employees, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and senior management of the Company, respectively, consider the potential effect(s) of such programs on the Company, as well as whether such programs create appropriate incentives. The only component of employee compensation that might pose a risk of having an adverse effect is annual cash incentive compensation, which is intended to incentivize our employees to achieve short-term financial performance objectives, and ties a portion of an employee's compensation to the achievement of such objectives. While annual cash incentive compensation encourages risk taking on the part of the Company's employees in their efforts to achieve these objectives, the Company believes that the risk is well managed and the level of risk is acceptable. Moreover, certain senior management members have a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of equity-based awards that are long-term in nature, including equity awards that are subject to achievement of long-term financial performance objectives. We believe this counter balances any motivation to unduly favor excessive short-term risk taking. We also believe that the applicable performance objectives create appropriate incentives for our employees from year-to-year. Risk is further reduced by the fact that annual cash incentives are awarded on a discretionary basis; any known excessive risk taking could result in a reduction or elimination of the annual payment. Furthermore, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are subject to clawback provisions under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
For these reasons we believe that our compensation policies and practices are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Pay Ratio
In 2018, the total compensation of Mr.  Christopher, our Chief Executive Officer, was $7,350,013, as reported in the "Summary Compensation Table for 2018." Based on the methodology described below, we determined that the median employee in terms of total 2018 compensation of all of our employees (other than Mr.  Christopher) received an estimated $35,587 in total compensation for 2018. Therefore, the estimated ratio of 2018 total compensation of Mr. Christopher to the median employee was 207:1.
In general, we offer employees base salary, company retirement plan contributions, the opportunity to receive incentive awards for performance, and other benefits. In accordance with SEC rules, the median employee compensation provided above reflects company retirement plan contributions, incentive awards for 2018 performance and other benefits, but does not reflect benefits relating to group life or health plans generally available to all salaried employees.
To determine median employee compensation, we took the following steps:

Employment Agreement with Mr. Christopher
On March 15, 2018, we entered into an indefinite term employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Mr. Christopher, pursuant to which he will continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reporting directly to the Board. The Employment Agreement replaced Mr. Christopher's prior employment agreement and, in so doing, eliminated the "single-trigger" severance to which Mr. Christopher would have been entitled upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company under the prior employment agreement.
The Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Christopher will receive a base salary of not less than $1,100,000 per year and will be eligible to receive an annual bonus award determined by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee. For each fiscal year, Mr. Christopher's target annual bonus will be 125% of his base salary upon achievement of target performance levels and he will be eligible for a maximum annual bonus of 250% of base salary when performance equals or exceeds 125% of the applicable performance objectives, with the actual annual bonus payable being based upon the actual level of achievement of annual Company and individual performance objectives for such fiscal year, as determined by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee. In addition, during the term of
Table of Contents
Mr. Christopher's employment, the Company will maintain a term life insurance policy for Mr. Christopher with a face value of at least $5 million, and Mr. Christopher will have the right to name the beneficiary of such term life insurance policy.
In the event that Mr. Christopher's employment is terminated for any reason (other than by the Company for "cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement)), he will, subject to his execution of a general release in favor of the Company and his continued compliance with certain restrictive covenants (the "Conditions"), be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: (i) any accrued but unpaid compensation and benefits; (ii) any unpaid annual bonus with respect to the previously completed fiscal year; (iii) subject to achievement of the applicable performance objectives for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, payment of a prorated annual bonus for such fiscal year; and (iv) continued medical, dental and hospitalization coverage (or payment in lieu of coverage if coverage is not permitted by applicable law or the terms of the applicable plan) for Mr. Christopher, his spouse and covered dependents until the latest of Mr. Christopher's 70th birthday, his spouse's 70th birthday, and the 3rd anniversary of such termination.
Additionally, if Mr. Christopher's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by Mr. Christopher for "good reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), Mr. Christopher will, subject to the Conditions, be entitled to (i) continued payment of his base salary for 36 months; except that if such termination occurs during the 24-months immediately following a "change in control" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), such amount will be paid in a lump sum on the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the 60th day following such termination; and (ii) an amount equal to 3 times Mr. Christopher's target annual bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which such termination occurs (or prior fiscal year, if greater), such amount to be paid in equal installments over the 3-year period following such termination at the same time such amounts would otherwise have been paid to Mr. Christopher had no termination occurred; provided that if Mr. Christopher's termination of employment occurs during the 24-month period following the consummation of a "change in control," such amount will be paid in a lump sum on the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the 60th day following such termination. The Employment Agreement does not provide for any "single-trigger" severance payments or benefits.
Table of Contents
The Employment Agreement does not provide any gross-up or tax assistance on the severance benefits. Instead, the Employment Agreement contains a "modified cutback" provision, which would act to reduce the benefits payable to Mr. Christopher to the extent necessary so that no "golden parachute excise tax" would be imposed on the benefits paid, but only if doing so would result in Mr. Christopher retaining a larger after-tax amount.
Mr. Christopher is subject to certain restrictive covenants during the term of his employment and thereafter, including customary non-compete restrictions that apply for one year post-termination and customary non-solicitation restrictions with respect to current and prospective employees that apply for one year post-termination. In addition, during the term of his employment and for one year thereafter, Mr. Christopher is prohibited from contacting any customer or prospective customer of the Company, or any representative of the same, for the purpose of providing any service or product competitive with any service or product sold or provided by the Company.
Change in Control Agreements with Messrs. Martin, Moss, Sigloch and Millerchip
On July 26, 2016, the Company entered into change in control agreements with certain key members of the management team, including Messrs. Martin, Moss, Sigloch and Millerchip. Pursuant to those agreements, if, upon or within two years following a "change in control", the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" (other than on account of death or Disability), or by the executive for "good reason", subject to execution of a general release of claims, the executive shall be entitled to: (i) an amount equal to two times the executive's base salary (as in effect immediately prior to the change in control or, if greater, the date of such termination); and (ii) an amount equal to two times the average annual bonus paid to the executive (including, for this purpose only, any amounts deferred) in respect of the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the change in control occurs (or the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year of such termination, if greater). The terms "change in control" and "cause" are defined in the 2014 Incentive Plan and the term "good reason" is defined in each executive's change in control agreement. The agreements also provide that for two years following termination under the circumstances described above, each of Messrs. Martin, Moss and Sigloch will receive (subject to the executive's election of COBRA continuation coverage under the Company's group health plan) continued coverage under the Company's group health plan at
Table of Contents the Company's cost (or at the direction of the Company, reimbursement for COBRA premiums) for two years following such termination. In the case of Mr. Millerchip, he will receive the cost of private health care, based upon costs incurred by the Company in the applicable year of termination, for two years following such termination.
2009 Stock Incentive Plan
In 2018, we maintained the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at our Annual Meeting in May 2009. Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee administers the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan and is authorized to, among other things, designate participants, grant awards, determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by awards and determine the terms and conditions of any awards, and construe and interpret the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan and related award agreements. The 2009 Stock Incentive Plan reserved 1,500,000 shares of our Common Stock for issuance, subject to adjustment in the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company or any other similar corporate transaction or event. The 2009 Stock Incentive Plan terminated as of February 12, 2019, and as such, there are no remaining shares issued thereunder that may be issued in the future.
2014 Incentive Plan
In 2018, we maintained the 2014 Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at our Annual Meeting in May 2014. Our Compensation and Stock Option Committee administers the 2014 Incentive Plan and is authorized to, among other things, designate participants, grant awards, including cash-based awards that historically were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by awards and determine the terms and conditions of any awards, and construe and interpret the 2014 Incentive Plan and related award agreements. The 2014 Incentive Plan reserved 1,500,000 shares of our Common Stock for issuance, subject to adjustment in the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company or any other similar corporate transaction or event.
We will continue to maintain the 2014 Incentive Plan and grant awards pursuant to it. The Mueller Industries, Inc. 2019 Incentive Plan, if approved by our stockholders, will be maintained in addition to the 2014 Incentive Plan.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The table below summarizes the total compensation we paid to our non-employee directors for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.
During the 2018 fiscal year, each of the non-employee directors received an annual fee of $60,000 in addition to fees of $2,000 per Board meeting. In his capacity as Chairman, Mr. Christopher received neither a retainer nor any meeting fees.
During the 2018 fiscal year, each director received $2,000 per Audit Committee meeting attended by such director. Also, each director received $1,000 per Compensation and Stock Option, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting attended by such director. In addition, each director received reimbursement for such director's expenses incurred in connection with any such Board or Committee meeting, and each Committee fee was paid whether or not such committee meeting was held in conjunction with a Board of Directors meeting.
Table of Contents
The Chairman of the Audit Committee received an annual fee of $15,000 while the Chairman of each of the Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees received an annual fee of $5,000.
In 2018, each non-employee director received a grant of options to purchase 4,000 shares of our Common Stock and was granted 2,000 shares of restricted stock pursuant to our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. Ms. Donovan was elected to the Board effective January 1, 2019, and as such, received no director compensation in respect of the 2018 fiscal year. Upon joining the Board on January 1, 2019, Ms. Donovan received a grant of options to purchase 2,000 shares of our Common Stock pursuant to our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. The options were fully vested as of their date of grant.
The Company has adopted stock ownership guidelines for its non-employee directors recommending that they hold equity interests of the Company (including vested and unvested interests, provided that with respect to options, only vested options that are exercisable within 60 days of the applicable measurement date will be counted) with a value equal to three times the annual cash director fee payable to each such director. The purpose of the stock ownership guidelines is to ensure that directors achieve and maintain a minimum level of stock ownership in order to further the Company's goal of aligning director economic interests with those of stockholders. All directors are expected to comply with the stock ownership guidelines within five years of being elected to the Board of Directors and current directors should comply as soon as practicable. Director compliance with the stock ownership guidelines is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Company's General Counsel.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process including the systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 1301. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from management and the Company, including the matters in the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Rule 3526, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services provided by the independent auditors with the auditor's independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee and the Board has re-appointed, subject to stockholder approval, Ernst & Young LLP, independent auditors, to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019.

APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") has been reappointed by the Audit Committee to audit and certify the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019, subject to ratification by the Company's stockholders. Ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. If the appointment of EY is not ratified by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the Audit Committee will reconsider its action and will appoint auditors for the 2019 fiscal year without further stockholder action. Further, even if the appointment is ratified by stockholder action, the Audit Committee may at any time in the future in its discretion reconsider the appointment without submitting the matter to a vote of stockholders. It is expected that representatives of EY will be in attendance at the Annual Meeting and will be available to answer questions and to make a statement if they desire to do so.
The following table sets forth fees for professional services rendered by EY for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for each of the two fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and fees for other services rendered by EY during those periods:
Audit Fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's consolidated annual financial statements and review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports and services that are normally provided by EY in connection with statutory filings. Audit Fees also include fees for professional services rendered for the audits of internal control over financial reporting in 2018 and 2017.
Audit-Related Fees include fees billed for assurance and other services not included in audit fees. The fees for 2018 and 2017 were for international accounting and reporting compliance.
Table of Contents
Tax Fees include fees billed for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning matters.
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chairman when expedition of services is necessary. The independent auditors and management are required periodically to report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. All of the services provided by the independent auditors during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively, under the categories Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees described above were pre-approved.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE THEIR SHARES FOR THE APPROVAL OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.
ADVISORY VOTE ON APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THECOMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, stockholders are being asked to vote on an advisory, non-binding basis, on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. This advisory vote gives stockholders another mechanism to convey their views about the Company's compensation programs and policies.
The Company's Compensation and Stock Option Committee is composed of knowledgeable and experienced independent directors, who are committed to regular review and effective oversight of our compensation programs. The Company's executive compensation program has been designed to motivate the Company's key employees to achieve the Company's strategic and financial goals and to support the creation of long-term value for stockholders. The Company's compensation policies and practices are centered on a pay for performance philosophy and reflect the belief that the Company's success continues to depend in substantial part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers. We encourage stockholders to read the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement, including the Compensation
Table of Contents
Discussion and Analysis and compensation tables, for a more detailed discussion of the Company's compensation programs and policies and how they are appropriate and effective in creating value.
The following resolution will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting. Stockholder approval of this proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Although the stockholder vote on executive compensation is not binding on the Board of Directors or the Company, the Company values the views of its stockholders. The Board of Directors and Compensation and Stock Option Committee will review the results of the vote and take them into consideration in addressing future compensation policies and decisions.
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers listed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in the proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting, as such compensation is disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in this proxy statement under the section titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," as well as the compensation tables and other narrative executive compensation disclosures thereafter."
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE THEIR SHARES FOR THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
APPROVAL OF THE 2019 INCENTIVE PLAN
The Company seeks stockholder approval of the Mueller Industries, Inc. 2019 Incentive Plan (the "2019 Incentive Plan"), which, if approved by our stockholders, will enable the Company to make future stock-based awards in furtherance of its broader compensation strategy, as discussed below.
Background
On March 13, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Incentive Plan, subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. The adoption of the 2019 Incentive Plan will not affect the terms and conditions of any outstanding awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan. If the 2019 Incentive Plan is not approved
Table of Contents by the stockholders, the 2019 Incentive Plan will be null and void, and the 2014 Incentive Plan will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions until May 1, 2024. The 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards (collectively, "awards") to our current and prospective employees, non-employee members of the Board of Directors, and other service providers. No awards will be granted pursuant to the 2019 Incentive Plan until it is approved by the Company's stockholders.
If the 2019 Incentive Plan is approved, the Company will be authorized to issue 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock, which represents approximately 3.5% of our outstanding Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis) as of December 29, 2018. The Company's stockholders have previously approved (i) the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, pursuant to which, as of February 12, 2019, all remaining shares granted thereunder expired, and (ii) the Company's 2014 Incentive Plan, pursuant to which, as of December 29, 2018, approximately 212,000 shares remained available for grant, plus the number of shares subject to awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan that are ultimately not delivered to participants. The Company will continue to maintain the 2014 Incentive Plan, whether or not the 2019 Incentive Plan is approved.
The Compensation Committee expects to continue to make equity award grants on an annual basis. The Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Incentive Plan because the number of shares currently available for grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan is insufficient to support the Company's desire to compensate its named executive officers and other employees, as well as future employees, with equity-based compensation, which the Company believes has been successful in aligning the interests of employees and the senior management team with those of the stockholders and instrumental in the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain team members. Based on a review of the Company's historical practices, the Board of Directors believes that the amounts available under the 2019 Incentive Plan will be sufficient to cover equity awards for participants for the next four to five years. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the number of shares of Common Stock underlying equity awards granted (including stock options and shares of restricted stock) was approximately 289,000, 374,000, and 418,000 shares, respectively. The Compensation Committee expects to continue to grant awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan consistent with the Company's historical share utilization rates.
Table of Contents
The Board of Directors believes that the 2019 Incentive Plan will serve a critical role in attracting and retaining the high caliber employees essential to the Company's success and in motivating these individuals to enhance our growth and profitability. The Board of Directors also believes that stock ownership by employees provides performance incentives and fosters long-term commitment to our benefit and to the benefit of our stockholders. Therefore, the Board of Directors urges stockholders to approve the 2019 Incentive Plan.
The following is a summary of the material features of the 2019 Incentive Plan, the complete text of which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.
Purpose
The 2019 Incentive Plan is designed to aid in the Company's ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified individuals to become and remain employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company, and to promote the creation of long-term value for the Company's stockholders by aligning the interests of such individuals with those of the stockholders. Given the entrepreneurial culture of the Company, the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors believe that talented employees create a competitive advantage and that recruiting, motivating, and retaining such talented employees requires that such individuals have a vested interest in the long-term success of the business. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has adopted the 2019 Incentive Plan as a part its broader compensation strategy, which has been and will continue to have a material portion of compensation in the form of long-term incentive opportunities.
Administration
The 2019 Incentive Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the authority to, among other things, designate participants, grant awards, determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by awards and determine the terms and conditions of any awards, and construe and interpret the 2019 Incentive Plan and related award agreements. The Compensation Committee is also permitted to delegate its authority under the 2019 Incentive Plan to officers or employees of the Company, although any award granted to any person who is not an employee of the Company or who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act must be expressly approved by the Compensation Committee.
Table of Contents
Shares Subject to the 2019 Incentive Plan
The Company has authorized 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan, which, as of March 15, 2019, had a fair market value of $31.94 per share. As discussed above, this proposed share reserve is based on the Company's projections of internal share requirements over the next several years to provide competitive and meaningful long-term incentive opportunities to employees of the Company. Awards and the shares authorized under the 2019 Incentive Plan are subject to adjustment as described below under "Changes in Capital Structure." Stock-based awards assumed or substituted by the Company or its affiliates as part of a corporate transaction (including from an entity that the Company merges with or into, acquires, or engages with in a similar corporate transaction) will not count against the number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the 2019 Incentive Plan except as may be required by Section 422 of the Code. If any award granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares to a participant, the undelivered shares will again become available for awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan.
Eligibility
The following individuals will be eligible to participate in the 2019 Incentive Plan: (i) each employee and officer of the Company or its affiliates, of which there are currently approximately 5,134, (ii) each non-employee director of the Company or its affiliates, of which there are currently eight, (iii) individuals who are not employees or directors of the Company or its affiliates but nonetheless provide substantial services to the Company or its affiliates, and who are designated as eligible by the Compensation Committee, and (iv) prospective employees of the Company or its affiliates, although such individuals may not receive any payment or exercise any rights relating to awards until they have actually commenced employment.
Grants of Awards
The Compensation Committee may grant awards of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards. Awards will vest in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. In addition, no
Table of Contents dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid on unvested awards, stock options or stock appreciation rights, or on vested restricted stock units prior to the actual delivery of shares of Common Stock.
Stock Options. The 2019 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and non-qualified stock options. A stock option granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan provides a participant with the right to purchase, within a specified period of time, a stated number of shares of Common Stock at the price specified in the applicable award agreement. The exercise price applicable to a stock option will be set by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, and to the extent intended to (i) avoid treatment as a "stock right" that does not provide for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) be an incentive stock option, will not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. In the case of a stock option that is a "substitute award" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan), the exercise price for such stock option may be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant provided that such exercise price is determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and, if applicable, Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, stock options may not be repriced without stockholder approval. Stock options will vest over a period of at least one year, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. The maximum term of an option granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan is ten years from the date of grant (or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder). Payment of the exercise price of an option may be made in cash, Common Stock, pursuant to a broker-assisted cashless exercise in accordance with procedures approved by the Compensation Committee, pursuant to a delivery of a notice of "net exercise," or in any other form of consideration approved by the Compensation Committee. The 2019 Incentive Plan provides that participants terminated for "cause" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan) will forfeit all of their stock options, whether or not vested. In addition, participants terminated by reason of a "qualifying retirement" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan) will have their stock options continue to vest according to schedule and such options will remain exercisable until they expire. Participants terminated for any other reason will forfeit their unvested options, retain their vested options, and will have one year (in the case of a termination by reason of death or disability) or 90 days (in all other cases) following
Table of Contents their termination date to exercise their vested options. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide for different treatment of stock options upon termination than that described above, as determined in its discretion.
No incentive stock options may be granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan following the 10th anniversary of the earlier of (i) the date the 2019 Incentive Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors and (ii) the date the stockholders of the Company approve the 2019 Incentive Plan.
Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right is a conditional right to receive an amount equal to the value of the appreciation in the Common Stock over a specified period. Except under extraordinary circumstances, at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, or pursuant to the 2019 Incentive Plan, stock appreciation rights will be settled in shares of Common Stock. The base price applicable to a stock appreciation right will be set by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, and to the extent intended to avoid treatment as a "stock right" that does not provide for a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, will not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. In the case of a stock appreciation right that is a "substitute award" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan), the base price for such stock appreciation right may be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant provided that such base price is determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The maximum term of a stock appreciation right granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan is ten years from the date of grant. Upon exercise of a stock appreciation right, payment in respect of such stock appreciation right may be made in cash, Common Stock, or property as specified in the applicable award agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in each case having a value in respect of each share of Common Stock underlying the portion of the stock appreciation right so exercised, equal to the difference between the base price of such stock appreciation right and the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on the exercise date. The 2019 Incentive Plan provides that participants terminated for "cause" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan) will forfeit all of their stock appreciation rights, whether or not vested. In addition, participants terminated by reason of a "qualifying retirement" (as such term is defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan) will have their stock appreciation rights continue to vest according to schedule and such
Table of Contents stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable until they expire. Participants terminated for any other reason will forfeit their unvested stock appreciation rights, retain their vested stock appreciation rights, and will have one year (in the case of a termination by reason of death or disability) or 90 days (in all other cases) following their termination date to exercise their vested stock appreciation rights. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide for different treatment of stock appreciation rights upon termination than that described above, as determined in its discretion.
Restricted Stock. An award of restricted stock is a grant of shares of Common Stock which are subject to limitations on transfer during a restricted period established in the applicable award agreement. Generally speaking, holders of restricted stock will generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder with respect to their restricted stock. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, in the event a participant is terminated for any reason, the vesting with respect to the participant's restricted stock will cease, and as soon as practicable following the termination, the Company will repurchase all of such participant's unvested shares of restricted stock at a purchase price equal to the original purchase price paid for the restricted stock, or if the original purchase price is equal to $0, the unvested shares of restricted stock will be forfeited by the participant to the Company for no consideration.
Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may award restricted stock units under the 2019 Incentive Plan, which are notional units representing the right to receive one share of Common Stock (or the cash value of one share of Common Stock) on a specified settlement date. When a participant satisfies the conditions of the restricted stock unit award, which the Compensation Committee will establish in the applicable award agreement, the Company may settle the award in shares, cash or property, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, in the event a participant is terminated for any reason, the vesting with respect to the participant's restricted stock units will cease, each of the participant's outstanding unvested restricted stock units will be forfeited for no consideration as of the date of such termination, and any shares remaining undelivered with respect to the participant's vested restricted stock units will be delivered on the delivery date specified in the applicable award agreement.
Table of Contents
Other Stock-Based Awards. The 2019 Incentive Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant other awards that may be denominated in, payable in, valued in, or otherwise related to shares of Common Stock. Such awards and the terms applicable to such awards will be set forth in award agreements.
General. All awards granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan will be subject to incentive compensation clawback and recoupment policies implemented by the Board of Directors from time to time. In addition, the Compensation Committee may adopt such procedures and sub-plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the 2019 Incentive Plan by individuals who are non-United States nationals or are primarily employed or providing services outside the United States, and may modify the terms of any awards granted to such participants in a manner deemed by the Compensation Committee to be necessary or appropriate in order that such awards conform with the laws of the country or countries where such participants are located.
No Repricing of Awards. No awards may be repriced without shareholder approval. For purposes of the 2019 Incentive Plan, "repricing" means any of the following: (i) changing the terms of the award to lower its exercise price or base price (other than on account of capital adjustments as described below under "Changes in Capital Structure"), (ii) any other action that is treated as a repricing under "generally accepted accounting principles," and (iii) repurchasing for cash or canceling an award in exchange for another award at a time when its exercise price or base price is greater than the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock.
Changes in Capital Structure
In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company, the declaration of any extraordinary dividend, or any change in applicable laws or circumstances which results or could result in the substantial dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the 2019 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee shall adjust the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be granted pursuant to awards, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by outstanding awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan, and the per-share price of outstanding awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an adjustment take the form of a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding award with respect to all
Table of Contents or part of an outstanding award, which payment will be subject to such terms and conditions (including timing of payment(s), vesting and forfeiture conditions) as the Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion.
Corporate Events
Under the 2019 Incentive Plan, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, in the event of a "corporate event" (as defined in the 2019 Incentive Plan), the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, provide for any one or more of the following: (i) require that outstanding awards be assumed or substituted in connection with such event, (ii) accelerate the vesting of any outstanding awards upon the consummation of such event, (iii) cancel outstanding awards upon the consummation of such event and provide award holders with the per-share consideration being received by the Company's stockholders in connection with such event in exchange for their awards, (iv) cancel all outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights and other awards subject to exercise, whether vested or unvested, not assumed or substituted in connection with such event as of the consummation of such event, and provide award holders at least 10 days to exercise each such stock option, stock appreciation right or other such exercisable award, as applicable, or (v) replace outstanding awards with a cash incentive program that preserves the value of the replaced awards and contains identical vesting conditions.
Non-Transferability of Awards
Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, the 2019 Incentive Plan provides that awards are generally nontransferable, including, without limitation, transfers to third party financial institutions, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and that restricted stock is generally nontransferable.
Termination and Amendment
The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate the 2019 Incentive Plan at any time, except that no amendment may, without stockholder approval, violate the stockholder approval requirements of the national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is principally listed. Unless sooner terminated, the 2019 Incentive Plan will terminate on the date before the tenth anniversary of the date the 2019 Incentive Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders.
Table of Contents
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a brief discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences for awards granted under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan is not subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and it is not, nor is it intended to be, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This discussion is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other things, does not describe state local or foreign taxes consequences, which may be substantially different. Holders of awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan should consult with their own tax advisors.
Non-Qualified Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. Except as noted below for corporate "insiders," with respect to nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights, (i) no income is realized by a participant at the time the award is granted; (ii) generally, at exercise, ordinary income is realized by the participant in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise or base price paid for the shares and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and the participant's employer is generally entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount subject to applicable tax withholding requirements; and (iii) upon a subsequent sale of the stock received on exercise, appreciation (or depreciation) after the date of exercise is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss) depending on how long the shares have been held, and no deduction will be allowed to such participant's employer.
Incentive Stock Options. No income is realized by a participant upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option, however, such participant will generally be required to include the excess of the fair market value of the shares at exercise over the exercise price in his or her alternative minimum taxable income. If shares are issued to a participant pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option, and if no disqualifying disposition of such shares is made by such participant within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the transfer of such shares to such participant, then (i) upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed to such participant as a long-term capital gain, and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (ii) no deduction will be allowed to the participant's employer for federal income tax purposes.
Except as noted below for corporate "insiders," if shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option are disposed of prior to the expiration of either holding period described above, generally (i) the participant will realize ordinary
Table of Contents income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of such shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the  disposition of such shares) over the exercise price paid for such shares and (ii) the participant's employer will generally be entitled to deduct such amount for federal income tax purposes. Any further gain (or loss) realized by the participant will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss), as the case may be, and will not result in any deduction by the employer.
Subject to certain exceptions for disability or death, if an incentive stock option is exercised more than three months following termination of employment, the exercise of the option will generally be taxed as the exercise of a nonqualified stock option.
Other Stock-Based Awards. The tax effects related to other stock-based awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan are dependent upon the structure of the particular award.
Withholding. At the time a participant is required to recognize ordinary compensation income resulting from an award, as described above, such income will be subject to federal and applicable state and local income tax and applicable tax withholding requirements. The Company will deduct or withhold, or require the participant to remit to his or her employer, an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local and foreign taxes required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of the 2019 Incentive Plan.
Section 409A. Certain awards under the 2019 Incentive Plan may be subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which regulates "nonqualified deferred compensation" (as defined in Section 409A). If an award under the 2019 Incentive Plan (or any other Company plan) that is subject to Section 409A is not administered in compliance with Section 409A, then all compensation under the 2019 Incentive Plan that is considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (and  awards under any other Company plan that are required pursuant to Section 409A to be aggregated with the award under the 2019 Incentive Plan) will be taxable to the participant as ordinary income in the year of the violation, or if later, the year in which the compensation subject to the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In addition, the participant will be subject to an additional tax equal to 20% of the compensation that is required to be included in income as a result of the violation, plus interest from the date that the compensation subject to the award was required to be included in taxable income.
Table of Contents
Certain Rules Applicable to "Insiders." As a result of the rules under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, depending upon the particular exemption from the provisions of Section 16(b) utilized, "insiders" (as defined in Section 16(b)) may not receive the same tax treatment as set forth above with respect to the grant and/or exercise or settlement of awards. Generally, insiders will not be subject to taxation until the expiration of any period during which they are subject to the liability provisions of Section 16(b) with respect to any particular award. Insiders should check with their own tax advisers to ascertain the appropriate tax treatment for any particular award.
New Plan Benefits
Because awards to be granted in the future under the 2019 Incentive Plan are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, it is not possible to determine the benefits or the amounts received or that will be received under the 2019 Incentive Plan by eligible participants.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table discloses information regarding the securities to be issued and the securities remaining available for issuance under the Company's stock-based incentive plans as of December 29, 2018 (shares in thousands). The amounts shown do not include the shares of Common Stock that would be available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan if this proposal is approved.

The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Participants such other Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based upon or related to Stock, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. The Committee may also grant Stock as a bonus (whether or not subject to any vesting requirements or other restrictions on transfer), and may grant other awards in lieu of obligations of the Company or an Affiliate to pay cash or deliver other property under this Plan or under other plans or compensatory arrangements, subject to such terms as shall be determined by the Committee. The terms and conditions applicable to such Awards shall be determined by the Committee and evidenced by Award Agreements, which agreements need not be identical.

Payments to holders pursuant to paragraph (3) above shall be made in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, and to the extent applicable, in the form of such other consideration necessary for a Participant to receive property, cash, or securities (or a combination thereof) as such Participant would have been
Table of Contents entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the transaction if the Participant had been, immediately prior to such transaction, the holder of the number of shares of Stock covered by the Award at such time (less any applicable exercise or base price). In addition, in connection with any Corporate Event, prior to any payment or adjustment contemplated under this subsection (b), the Committee may require a Participant to (A) represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to his or her Awards, (B) bear such Participant's pro-rata share of any post-closing indemnity obligations, and be subject to the same post-closing purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and similar conditions as the other holders of Stock, and (C) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably determined by the Committee.
The proceeds received from the sale of Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be used for general corporate purposes.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, no person shall be entitled to the rights and privileges of Stock ownership in respect of shares of Stock that are subject to Awards hereunder until such shares have been issued to that person.
Awards may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, including, without limitation, to third party financial institutions, other than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, and to the extent subject to exercise, Awards may not be exercised during the lifetime of the grantee other than by the grantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to Incentive Stock Options, Awards and a Participant's rights under the Plan shall be transferable for no value and only to the extent provided in an Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee.
Table of Contents
No individual shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan or, having been selected for the grant of an Award, to be selected for the grant of any other Award. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any individual any right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company.
The obligation of the Company to deliver Stock upon issuance, vesting, exercise, or settlement of any Award shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by governmental agencies as may be required. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any shares of Stock pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly registered for sale with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Company, that such shares may be offered or sold without such registration pursuant to an available exemption therefrom and the terms and conditions of such exemption have been fully complied with. The Company shall be under no obligation to register for sale or resale under the Securities Act any of the shares of Stock to be offered or sold under the Plan or any shares of Stock to be issued upon exercise or settlement of Awards. If the shares of Stock offered for sale or sold under the Plan are offered or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, the Company may restrict the transfer of such shares and may legend the Stock certificates representing such shares in such manner as it deems advisable to ensure the availability of any such exemption.
As a condition to the issuance, vesting, exercise, or settlement of any Award (or upon the making of an election under Section 83(b) of the Code), the Committee may require that a Participant satisfy, through deduction or withholding from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant, or through such other arrangements as are satisfactory to the Committee, the minimum amount of all federal, state, and local income and other taxes of any kind required or permitted to be withheld in connection with such vesting, exercise, or settlement (or election).
Table of Contents
The Committee, in its discretion, may permit shares of Stock to be used to satisfy tax withholding requirements, and such shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value as of the issuance, vesting, exercise, or settlement date of the Award, as applicable. Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold by considering the applicable minimum statutorily required withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates in the applicable Participant's jurisdiction, including maximum applicable rates that may be utilized without creating adverse accounting treatment under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor pronouncement thereto).
Table of Contents
The Board or the Committee may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless sooner terminated, the Plan shall terminate on the day before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date. No Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated; provided, however, that following any suspension or termination of the Plan, the Plan shall remain in effect for the purpose of governing all Awards then outstanding hereunder until such time as all Awards under the Plan have been terminated, forfeited, or otherwise canceled, or earned, exercised, settled, or otherwise paid out, in accordance with their terms.
The Plan is effective as of the Effective Date, subject to stockholder approval.
