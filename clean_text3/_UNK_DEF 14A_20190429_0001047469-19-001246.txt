Dear Shareholder: 
        You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of shareholders of Owl Rock Capital Corporation II (the "Company") to be held on April 29, 2019 at 8:15 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of the Company, 399 Park Avenue, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10022 (the "Annual Meeting"). 
        Your vote is very important! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save the Company significant additional expenses associated with soliciting shareholder votes.
        The Notice of the Annual Meeting and proxy statement accompanying this letter provide an outline of the business to be conducted at the meeting. The Annual Meeting is being held for the following purposes: 
          (i)  to elect three members of the board of directors of the Company to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; 
         (ii)  to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and 
        (iii)  to transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
        The Company's board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR each of the proposals to be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting.
        The Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials to certain of its shareholders over the internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. On or about March 14, 2019, the Company intends to mail to most of its shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the proxy statement and annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Annual Report"), and how to submit proxies over the internet. All other shareholders will receive a copy of the proxy statement and Annual Report by mail. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how you can elect to receive a printed copy of the proxy statement and Annual Report. The Company believes that providing its proxy materials over the internet will expedite shareholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs associated with the Annual Meeting and conserve resources. 
        It is important that your shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, be represented at the Annual Meeting. If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, I urge you to complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and promptly return it in the envelope provided, or follow the instructions printed on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy card to authorize a proxy through the internet. 
        Your vote and participation in the governance of the Company are very important. 
Sincerely yours, 
Craig W. Packer  Chief Executive Officer, President and Director

    GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING         
        The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Annual Meeting to be held at the offices of the Company, 399 Park Avenue, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10022, on April 29, 2019 at 8:15 a.m., Eastern Time. Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on February 27, 2019, which is the Record Date, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on the Record Date, we had 58,334,585 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), outstanding and entitled to vote. This proxy statement, including the accompanying form of proxy (collectively, the "Proxy Statement"), or a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the Proxy Statement and annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Annual Report"), and how to submit proxies over the internet, are first being sent to shareholders on or about March 14, 2019. The Annual Report and Proxy Statement can both be accessed online at www.proxyvote.com. 
        All proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. Unless contrary instructions are specified, if a proxy is properly executed and received by the Company (and not revoked) prior to the Annual Meeting, the Shares represented by the proxy will be voted (1) FOR the election of three members of the board of directors of the Company to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, and (2) FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Should any matter not described above be properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the named proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment as permitted. 
   Voting Rights  
        Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date. 
        The Annual Meeting is being held for the following purposes: 
        1.     To elect three members of the board of directors of the Company to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; 
        2.     To ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and 
        3.     To transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
   Quorum Required  
        A majority of the outstanding Shares must be present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order to have a quorum. If you have properly voted by proxy via internet or mail, you will be considered part of the quorum. We will count "abstain" and "withhold" votes as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. If at any time Shares are held through brokers, we will count broker non-votes as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding Shares for a beneficial owner votes on some matters on the proxy card, but not on others, because the broker does not have instructions from the beneficial owner or discretionary authority (or declines to exercise discretionary authority) with respect to those other matters. 
   Vote Required  
        The inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting will separately tabulate affirmative and "against" votes, "abstain" votes, and broker non-votes. 
   Voting  
        You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy in accordance with the instructions provided below. You also may authorize a proxy through the internet using the web address included in your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Authorizing a proxy through the internet requires you to input the control number located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. After inputting the control number, you will be prompted to direct your proxy to vote on each proposal. You will have an opportunity to review your directions and make any necessary changes before submitting your directions and terminating internet link. 
        When voting by proxy and mailing your proxy card, you are required to:
         Important notice regarding the availability of proxy materials for the Annual Meeting.    The Company's Proxy Statement, the proxy card, and the Company's Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how you can elect to receive a printed copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report. 
        If you plan on attending the Annual Meeting and voting your shares of the Company's common stock in person, you will need to bring photo identification in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting.
   Quorum and Adjournment  
        A quorum must be present at the Annual Meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date will constitute a quorum. 
        If a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, the Chairman may adjourn the Annual Meeting until a quorum is present. 
   Proxies for the Annual Meeting  
        The named proxies for the Annual Meeting are Victor Lopez and Alan Kirshenbaum (or their duly authorized designees), who will follow submitted proxy voting instructions. They will vote as the Board recommends herein as to any submitted proxies that do not direct how to vote on any item, and will vote on any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting in their judgment. 
   Expenses of Soliciting Proxies  
        The Company will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing and posting this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to the internet, and the cost of mailing the Notice of Annual Meeting, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, and any requested proxy materials to the shareholders.

    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS         
        Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting thereof, or to dispose or direct the disposition thereof or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. The following table sets forth, as of February 27, 2019, the beneficial ownership as indicated in the Company's books and records of each current director, the nominees for director, the Company's executive officers, the executive officers and directors as a group, and each person known to us to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
        The percentage ownership is based on 58,334,585 shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 27, 2019.

    PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES         
        At the Annual Meeting, shareholders of the Company are being asked to consider the election of three directors of the Company. Pursuant to the Company's bylaws, the number of directors on the Board may not be fewer than the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law, or greater than eleven. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, (the "Charter"), the directors are divided into three classes. Each class of directors holds office for a three-year term. However, the initial members of the three classes have initial terms of one, two, and three years, respectively. The Board currently consist of seven directors who serve in the following classes: Class I (terms ending at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders)—Brian Finn and Eric Kaye; Class II (terms ending at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders)—Douglas I. Ostrover and Christopher M. Temple; and Class III (terms ending at the Annual Meeting)—Edward D'Alelio, Alan Kirshenbaum, and Craig W. Packer. 
        Edward D'Alelio, Alan Kirshenbaum, and Craig W. Packer each have been nominated for election by the Board to serve a three-year term until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each director nominee has agreed to serve as a director if re-elected and has consented to being named as a nominee. 
        A shareholder can vote for, or against, any or all of the director nominees. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote such proxy FOR the election of each of the director nominees named below. If any of the director nominees should decline or be unable to serve as a director, the persons named as proxies will vote for such other nominee as may be proposed by the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the persons named as director nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve. 
   Required Vote  
        Each director nominee shall be elected by a majority of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote with respect to the Director Proposal. There will be no cumulative voting with respect to Proposal 1. 
   Information about the Nominees and Directors  
        Set forth below is information, as of February 27, 2019, regarding Messrs. D'Alelio, Kirshenbaum and Packer, who are being nominated for election as a director of the Company by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting, as well as information about our other current directors whose terms of office will continue after the Annual Meeting.

Corp. Mr. Temple holds a B.B.A., magna cum laude, from the University of Texas and an M.B.A. from Harvard.

    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE         
   Our Board of Directors  
   Board Composition  
        The Board consists of seven members. The Board is divided into three classes, with the members of each class serving staggered, three-year terms; however, the initial members of the three classes have initial terms of one, two and three years, respectively. The terms of our Class I directors will expire at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders; the term of our Class II directors will expire at the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders; and the terms of our Class III directors will expire at the Annual Meeting. 
        Messrs. Finn and Kaye serve as Class I directors (with terms expiring in 2020). Messrs. Temple and Ostrover serve as Class II directors (with terms expiring in 2021). Messrs. D'Alelio, Packer, and Kirshenbaum serve as Class III directors (with terms expiring at the Annual Meeting). 
   Independent Directors  
        Pursuant to the Company's Charter, a majority of the Board will consist of directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company, of the Adviser, or of any of their respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act ("Independent Directors"). 
        Consistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant transactions and relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and the Company, the Adviser, or of any of their respective affiliates, the Board has determined that Messrs. Finn, Kaye, Temple, and D'Alelio qualify as Independent Directors. Each director who serves on the Audit Committee is an independent director for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). 
   Interested Directors  
        Messrs. Ostrover, Packer, and Kirshenbaum are considered "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company since they are officers of the Adviser. 
   Meetings and Attendance  
        The Board met 5 times during 2018 and acted on various occasions by written consent. Each director attended all meetings of the Board (held during the period for which he has been a director), except for Mr. D'Alelio who did not attend one meeting of the Board and Mr. Ostrover who did not attend four meetings of the Board. 
   Board Attendance at the Annual Meeting  
        Our policy is to encourage our directors to attend each annual meeting; however, such attendance is not required at this time. All of our directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
   Board Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities  
        Overall responsibility for our oversight rests with the Board. We have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement") pursuant to which the Adviser will manage the Company on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Adviser and our other service providers in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and our charter. The Board is currently composed of seven members, four of whom are directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company or the Adviser as defined in the 1940 Act. The Board meets in person at regularly scheduled quarterly meetings each year. In addition, the Board may hold special in-person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. As described below, the Board has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and an Audit Committee, and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time, to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. 
        The Board has appointed Edward D'Alelio, an independent director, to serve in the role of Chairman of the Board. The Chairman's role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with the Adviser, counsel and other directors generally between meetings. The Chairman serves as a key point person for dealings between management and the directors. The Chairman also may perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board reviews matters related to its leadership structure annually. The Board has determined that the Board's leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over the matters under its purview and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of directors and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. 
        We are subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. Risk oversight forms part of the Board's general oversight of the Company and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the Adviser and other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), which carry out our investment management and business affairs. The Adviser and other service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various events or circumstances that give rise to risks, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each of the Adviser and other service providers has their own independent interest in risk management, and their policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions and business models. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Company or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. As part of its regular oversight of the Company, the Board interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the Adviser, our chief compliance officer, our independent registered public accounting firm and counsel, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Company and applicable risk controls. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. 
   Communications with Directors  
        Shareholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of the Board by mail. To communicate with the Board, any individual directors or any group or committee of directors, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or any such individual directors or group or committee of directors by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent to Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, 399 Park Avenue, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Secretary. 
   Committees of the Board  
        The Board has an Audit Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") and may form additional committees in the future. The Board does not currently delegate any authority to a compensation committee for executive officers because our executive officers will not receive any direct compensation from us. 
        A brief description of each committee is included in this Proxy Statement and the charters of the Audit, and Nominating Committees can be accessed on the Company's website at  www.owlrock.com. 
        As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the members of each of the Board's committees are as follows (the names of the respective committee chairperson are bolded): 
        Each of our directors who sits on the Audit and Nominating Committees is not considered an "interested person" of the Company as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Board has determined that Messrs. Temple and Finn each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K, as promulgated under the 1934 Act. Messrs. D'Alelio, Kaye and Temple meet the current independence and experience requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the 1934 Act. 
   Audit Committee Governance, Responsibilities and Meetings  
        In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board, the Audit Committee: 
        (a)   assists the Board's oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm; 
        (b)   prepares an Audit Committee report, if required by the SEC, to be included in our annual proxy statement; 
        (c)   oversees the scope of the annual audit of our financial statements, the quality and objectivity of our financial statements, accounting and financial reporting policies and internal controls; 
        (d)   determines the selection, appointment, retention and termination of our independent registered public accounting firm, as well as approving the compensation thereof; 
        (e)   pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided to us and certain other persons by such independent registered public accounting firm; and 
        (f)    acts as a liaison between our independent registered public accounting firm and the Board. 
        The Audit Committee had 8 formal meetings in 2018. Each member of the Audit Committee (during the period for which he has been a member of the committee) who served on such committee during the 2018 fiscal year attended all of the meetings held during 2018, except for Mr. Finn who did not attend one meeting of the Audit Committee and Mr. D'Alelio who did not attend four meetings of the Audit Committee. 
   Nominating Committee Governance, Responsibilities and Meetings  
        In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board, the Nominating Committee: 
        (a)   recommends to the Board persons to be nominated by the Board for election at the Company's meetings of our shareholders, special or annual, if any, or to fill any vacancy on the Board that may arise between shareholder meetings; 
        (b)   makes recommendations with regard to the tenure of the directors; 
        (c)   is responsible for overseeing an annual evaluation of the Board and its committee structure to determine whether the structure is operating effectively; and 
        (d)   recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to the independent directors of the Board. 
        The Nominating Committee will consider for nomination to the Board candidates submitted by our shareholders or from other sources it deems appropriate. 
        The Nominating Committee had one formal meeting in 2018. Each member of the Nominating Committee (during the period for which he has been a member of the committee) who served on such committee during the 2018 fiscal year attended the meeting held during 2018, except for Mr. D'Alelio who did not attend one meeting. 
   Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  
        We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to our executive officers, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as well as every officer, director and employee of the Company. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be accessed on our website at  www.owlrock.com.
        There have been no material changes to our corporate code of ethics or material waivers of the code that apply to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. If we make any substantive amendment to, or grant a waiver from, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website at  www.owlrock.com as well as file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   Election of Officers  
        Executive officers hold their office until their successors have been duly elected and qualified, or until the earlier of their resignation or removal. 
   Compensation Discussion and Analysis  
        We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the administration agreement between the Company and the Adviser (the "Administration Agreement"), as applicable. Our day-to-day investment and administrative operations are managed by the Adviser. Most of the services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio will be provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. 
        None of our executive officers will receive direct compensation from us. We will reimburse the Adviser the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). The members of the Investment Committee, through their financial interests in the Adviser, are entitled to a portion of the profits earned by the Adviser, which includes any fees payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, less expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
   Director Compensation  
        No compensation is expected to be paid to our directors who are "interested persons," as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Our directors who do not also serve in an executive officer capacity for us or the Adviser are entitled to receive annual cash retainer fees, fees for participating in in-person board and committee meetings and annual fees for serving as a committee chairperson, determined based on our net assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter. These directors are Edward D'Alelio, Christopher M. Temple, Eric Kaye and Brian Finn. Amounts payable under the arrangement are determined and paid quarterly in arrears as follows:

   Compensation of the Investment Adviser  
        On February 6, 2017, the Company entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser, which became effective on April 4, 2017, the date the Company met the minimum offering requirement. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for managing the Company's business and activities, including sourcing investment opportunities, conducting research, performing diligence on potential investments, structuring its investments, and monitoring its portfolio companies on an ongoing basis through a team of investment professionals. 
        The Adviser's services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. 
        Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company will pay the Adviser a base management fee and may also pay a performance based incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the Company's shareholders. 
        The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The management fee is payable at an annual rate of 1.75% of the average value of the Company's gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts at the end of the Company's two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial quarter is appropriately prorated. The determination of gross assets will reflect changes in the fair value of the Company's portfolio investments. The fair value of derivatives and swaps held in the Company's portfolio, which will not necessarily equal the notional value of such derivatives and swaps, will be included in the calculation of gross assets. 
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred management fees (gross of waivers) of approximately $6.5 million. 
        The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee will be based on the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income and a portion will be based on the Company's capital gains. The portion of the incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears and equals (a) 100% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income between 1.5% quarterly preferred return, and 1.875%, referred to as the upper level breakpoint, of adjusted capital, plus (b) 20% of pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of 1.875% of adjusted capital. Adjusted capital is defined as cumulative proceeds generated from sales of our common stock, including proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan, net of sales load (upfront selling commissions and upfront dealer manager fees) reduced for (i) distributions paid to our shareholders that represent a return of capital on a tax basis and (ii) amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program, if any, measured as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The quarterly preferred return of 1.5% and upper level breakpoint of 1.875% are also adjusted for the actual number of days in each calendar quarter. 
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred performance based incentive fees (gross of waivers) based on net investment income of $2.3 million. 
        The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the quarterly incentive fee on income: 
    Quarterly Incentive Fee on   Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income   (expressed as a percentage of adjusted capital)         
    Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income   Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee         
        The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, and equals 20% of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of each calendar year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fee for prior periods. In no event will the capital gains incentive fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), including Section 205 thereof. 
        While the Investment Advisory Agreement neither includes nor contemplates the inclusion of unrealized gains in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee, pursuant to the interpretation of the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants Technical Practice Aid for investment companies, the Company accrues capital gains incentive fees on unrealized gains. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to the Adviser if the Company's entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though the Adviser is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a reduction in performance based incentive fees (gross of waivers) based on capital gains of $19 thousand. 
        On June 8, 2018, the Adviser agreed, at all times prior to the date of the closing of a liquidity event, and beginning on April 1, 2018, to waive (A) any portion of the management fee that is in excess of 1.50% of our gross assets, excluding cash but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement, (B) any portion of the incentive fee on net investment income that is in excess of 17.5% of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income, which shall be calculated in accordance with the Investment Advisory Agreement but based on a quarterly preferred return of 1.50% per quarter and an upper level breakpoint of 1.818%, and (C) any portion of the incentive fee on capital gains that is in excess of 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, minus the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any portion of the management fee, incentive fee on net investment income and incentive fee on capital gains waived shall not be subject to recoupment. 
        On February 27, 2019, the Adviser agreed to waive 100% of the incentive fee on net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2018, as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any portion of the incentive fee on net investment income waived shall not be subject to recoupment. 
        Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is entitled to receive up to 1.5% of gross offering proceeds raised in the continuous public offering until all organization and offering costs paid by the Adviser or its affiliates have been recovered. The offering expenses consist of corporate and organizational expenses relating to offerings of shares of common stock, subject to limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement; the cost of calculating the Company's net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; the cost of effecting any sales and repurchases of the common stock and other securities; fees and expenses payable under any dealer manager agreements, if any; debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; costs of hedging; expenses, including travel expense, incurred by the Adviser, or members of the Investment Team, or payable to third parties, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, enforcing the Company's rights; escrow agent, transfer agent and custodial fees and expenses; fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; federal and state registration fees, any stock exchange listing fees and fees payable to rating agencies; federal, state and local taxes; independent directors' fees and expenses, including certain travel expenses; costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, including registration fees, listing fees and licenses, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing; the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to shareholders (including printing and mailing costs); the costs of any shareholder or director meetings and the compensation of personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; research and market data; fidelity bond, directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance and other insurance premiums; direct costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff; fees and expenses associated with independent audits, outside legal and consulting costs; costs of winding up; costs incurred in connection with the formation or maintenance of entities or vehicles to hold the Company's assets for tax or other purposes; extraordinary expenses (such as litigation or indemnification); and costs associated with reporting and compliance obligations under the Advisers Act and applicable federal and state securities laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company shall reimburse the Adviser (or its affiliates) for an allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to the Company's Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs (based on a percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business affairs of the Company). Any such reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. The Adviser is responsible for the payment of the Company's organization and offering expenses to the extent that these expenses exceed 1.5% of the aggregate gross offering proceeds, without recourse against or reimbursement by the Company. 
        For the year ended December 31, 2018, subject to the 1.5% organization and offering cost cap, the Company accrued initial organization and offering expenses of $5.4 million. 
        Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until April 4, 2020 and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, by a majority of independent directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company as defined in the 1940 Act. 
        The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment. In accordance with the 1940 Act, without payment of any penalty, the Company may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser upon 60 days' written notice and a majority vote of the directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company or the shareholders holding a majority (as defined under the 1940 Act) of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, without payment of any penalty, the Adviser may only be able to terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon 120 days' written notice. 
        From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. 
   Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  
        We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement and an expense reimbursement and conditional reimbursement agreement (the "Expense Support Agreement") with the Adviser. In addition, the Board has authorized us to enter into promissory notes with the Adviser. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee. See "—Compensation of the Investment Adviser" for a description of how the fees payable to the Adviser will be determined. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we will reimburse the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations. The purpose of the Expense Support Agreement is to ensure that no portion of our distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for tax purposes. Pursuant to the promissory notes we may borrow up to $50 million from the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees. 
        Our executive officers, certain of our directors and certain other finance professionals of Owl Rock Capital Partners also serve as executives of the Adviser, ORTA and ORCPFA (which we refer to collectively, together with Owl Rock Capital Partners, as "Owl Rock") and officers and directors of the Company and certain professionals of Owl Rock Capital Partners and the Adviser are officers of Owl Rock Capital Securities LLC ("Owl Rock Securities"), the dealer manager for our offering. In addition, our executive officers and directors and the members of the Adviser and members of its investment committee serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same, or a related, line of business as we do or of investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles managed by our affiliates. These investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles may have investment objectives similar to our investment objective. We may compete with entities managed by the Adviser and its affiliates, including ORCC, ORTFC and Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund L.P., a fund advised by ORCPFA, for capital and investment opportunities. As a result, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles managed by the Adviser or its affiliates or by members of the investment committee. However, in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties to each of its clients, the Adviser intends to allocate investment opportunities in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and is consistent with Owl Rock's allocation policy, so that we are not disadvantaged in relation to any other client, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments, cash on hand, existing commitments and reserves, the investment programs and portfolio positions of the participating investment accounts, the clients for which participation is appropriate, targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and any other factors deemed appropriate. 
   Policies and Procedures for Managing Conflicts  
        The Adviser and its affiliates have policies and procedures in place designed to manage the potential conflicts of interest between the Adviser's fiduciary obligations to us and its or its affiliates similar fiduciary obligations to other clients, including ORCC, ORTFC and Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund L.P. An investment opportunity that is suitable for multiple clients of the Adviser and its affiliates may not be capable of being shared among some or all of such clients and affiliates due to the limited scale of the opportunity or other factors, including regulatory restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act. There can be no assurance that the Adviser's or its affiliates' efforts to allocate any particular investment opportunity fairly among all clients for whom such opportunity is appropriate will result in an allocation of all or part of such opportunity to us. Not all conflicts of interest can be expected to be resolved in our favor. 
        The principals of the Adviser may manage investment vehicles with similar or overlapping investment strategies, such as ORCC, which the Adviser manages and whose investment strategy is similar to ours, ORTFC, which ORTA manages, and Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund L.P., which ORCPFA manages. In order to address these issues, Owl Rock has put in place an investment allocation policy that seeks to ensure the equitable allocation of investment opportunities and addresses the co-investment restrictions set forth under the 1940 Act. When we engage in co-investment opportunities as permitted by the exemptive relief described below, we will do so in a manner consistent with Owl Rock's allocation policy. In situations where co-investment with other entities managed by the Adviser or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest in different securities of the same issuer, the Adviser will need to decide whether we or such other entity or entities will proceed with the investment. The Adviser will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts in a manner that will be fair and equitable over time. 
        The Adviser's allocation of investment opportunities among us and any of the other investment funds sponsored or accounts managed by the Adviser or its affiliates may not always, and often will not, be proportional. In general, the Adviser's and its affiliates process for making an allocation determination includes an assessment by the Adviser or its affiliates, as applicable, as to whether a particular investment opportunity (including any follow-on investment in, or disposition from, an existing portfolio company held by the Company or another investment fund or account) is suitable for us or another investment fund or account including ORCC, ORTFC and Owl Rock First Lien Master Fund L.P. In making this assessment, the Adviser may consider a variety of factors, including, without limitation: the investment objectives, guidelines and strategies applicable to the investment fund or account; the nature of the investment, including its risk-return profile and expected holding period; portfolio diversification and concentration concerns; the liquidity needs of the investment fund or account; the ability of the investment fund or account to accommodate structural, timing and other aspects of the investment process; the life cycle of the investment fund or account; legal, tax and regulatory requirements and restrictions, including, as applicable, compliance with the 1940 Act (including requirements and restrictions pertaining to co-investment opportunities discussed below); compliance with existing agreements of the investment fund or account; the available capital of the investment fund or account; diversification requirements for business development companies or regulated investment companies; the gross asset value and net asset value of the investment fund or account; the current and targeted leverage levels for the investment fund or account; and portfolio construction considerations. The relevance of each of these criteria will vary from investment opportunity to investment opportunity. In circumstances where the investment objectives of multiple investment funds or accounts regularly overlap, while the specific facts and circumstances of each allocation decision will be determinative, the Adviser may afford prior decisions precedential value. 
        If, through the foregoing analysis, the Adviser and its affiliates determine an investment opportunity to be appropriate for multiple investment funds or accounts, the Adviser and its affiliates generally will determine the appropriate size of the opportunity for each such investment fund or account. If an investment opportunity falls within the mandate of two or more investment funds or accounts, and there are no restrictions on such funds or accounts investing with each other, then each investment fund or account will receive the amount of the investment that it is seeking, as determined based on the criteria set forth above. 
        Certain allocations may be more advantageous to us relative to one or all of the other investment funds, or vice versa. While the Adviser will seek to allocate investment opportunities in a way that it believes in good faith is fair and equitable to us, there can be no assurance that our actual allocation of an investment opportunity, if any, or terms on which the allocation is made, will be as favorable as they would be if the conflicts of interest to which the Adviser may be subject did not exist. 
   Co-Investment Opportunities  
        As a business development company, we are subject to certain regulatory restrictions in negotiating certain investments with entities with which we may be restricted from doing so under the 1940 Act, such as the Adviser and its affiliates, unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC. 
        On February 7, 2017, we, the Adviser and certain of our affiliates received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our affiliates' participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which we are investing. Owl Rock's investment allocation policy incorporates the conditions of the exemptive relief. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of ORCC, ORTFC and/or other funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief. 
   License Agreement  
        We have entered into a license agreement (the "License Agreement"), pursuant to which an affiliate of Owl Rock Capital Partners has granted us a non-exclusive license to use the name "Owl Rock." Under the License Agreement, we have a right to use the Owl Rock name for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the "Owl Rock" name or logo. 
   Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement  
        On February 6, 2017, we entered into the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser, the purpose of which is to ensure that no portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders will represent a return of capital for tax purposes. The Expense Support Agreement became effective as of April 4, 2017. 
   Dealer Manager Agreement  
        On February 8, 2017, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement (the "Dealer Manager Agreement") with Owl Rock Securities, an affiliate of Owl Rock Capital Partners. Under the terms of the Dealer Manager Agreement, Owl Rock Securities serves as the dealer manager for our continuous offering. As dealer manager, Owl Rock Securities will earn a maximum sales load of up to 5.0% of the price per share for combined upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, a portion or all of which may be reallowed to selling broker-dealers. In connection with purchases of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, the upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees will not be paid. 
        Owl Rock Securities will not make an independent review of us or our continuous offering. This relationship may create conflicts in connection with the dealer manager's due diligence obligations under the federal securities laws. Although the dealer manager will examine the information in any prospectus for accuracy and completeness, due to its affiliation with the Adviser, no independent review of us will be made in connection with the distribution of our shares. 
        Owl Rock Securities is registered as a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. 
        The Dealer Manager Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of a majority of our directors who are not "interested persons", as defined in the 1940 Act, and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of our distribution plan or the Dealer Manager Agreement or by vote a majority of the outstanding voting securities, on not more than 60 days' written notice to Owl Rock Securities and the Adviser. The Dealer Manager Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act. 
   Material Non-Public Information  
        Our senior management, members of the Adviser's investment committee and other investment professionals from the Adviser may serve as directors of, or in a similar capacity with, companies in which we invest or in which we are considering making an investment. Through these and other relationships with a company, these individuals may obtain material non-public information that might restrict our ability to buy or sell the securities of such company under the policies of the company or applicable law. 
   Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  
        Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's directors and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of its shares, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based on the Company's review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 filed by such persons and information provided by the Company's directors and officers, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons were timely filed. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE  DIRECTOR NOMINEES.  
    PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT   REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         
        KPMG LLP, New York, New York, has been appointed by the Board to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG LLP acted as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. The Company knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of KPMG LLP in the Company. A representative of KPMG LLP will be available to answer questions during the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. 
        Although action by the shareholders on this matter is not required, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it is appropriate to seek shareholder ratification of this selection in light of the role played by the independent registered public accounting firm in reporting on the Company's consolidated financial statements. If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the appointment of KPMG LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 is not ratified by the shareholders, the adverse vote will be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to appoint KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the succeeding fiscal year. 
   Fees  
        Set forth in the table below are audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and all other fees billed to the Company by KPMG LLP for professional services performed for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018:

   Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures  
        The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the auditor's independence. 
        Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. 
   Audit Committee Report  
        As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with both management and KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC as part of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Management advised the Audit Committee that all financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and reviewed significant accounting issues with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as amended, and by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
        The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by KPMG LLP. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and non-audit services performed by KPMG LLP in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the firm's independence. 
        Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by KPMG LLP to management. 
        The Audit Committee received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the audit fees paid by the Company to KPMG LLP. It has also reviewed non-audit services and fees to assure compliance with the Company's and the Audit Committee's policies restricting KPMG LLP from performing services that might impair its independence. 
        Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the appointment of KPMG LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

The material in this Audit Committee report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE  APPOINTMENT OF KPMG AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC  ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  
       OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE ANNUAL MEETING         
        The Board is not aware of any matters that will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting other than the matters set forth herein. Should any other matters requiring a vote of shareholders arise, it is intended that the proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy. 
    SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS         
   Inclusion of Proposals in Our Proxy Statement and Proxy Card Under the SEC's Rules  
        Any proposal of a shareholder intended to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy/voting instruction card for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the SEC's rules must be received by us on or before November 14, 2019. Such proposals must also comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC if such proposals are to be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy. All proposals should be addressed to the Victor Lopez, Secretary, Owl Rock Capital Corporation II, 399 Park Avenue, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
        Shareholder proposals or director nominations to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, other than shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to the SEC's Rule 14a-8, must be submitted in accordance with the advance notice procedures and other requirements set forth in our bylaws.
