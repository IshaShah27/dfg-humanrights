CHAIRMAN'S LETTER 
Dear Shareholders: 
As I reflect back on 2018, I see a year where we: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Established Delphi Technologies as a standalone enterprise.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Secured conquest wins in both our power electronics and software & controls portfolios with the world's largest  automakers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improved our Aftermarket margins and operating profits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broke ground on three new plants in Poland, Mexico and China to create new electronic capabilities closer to our  customer's growing needs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Announced key collaborations with PolyCharge and TomTom to give us technological advantages in future propulsion;  enabling vehicles to drive Cleaner. Better. Further.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Selected an experienced and successful chief executive officer for Delphi.  
[END TABLE]
But — let's be frank. We also struggled in 2018. The faster-than-expected shift in the light diesel segment and a significantly weaker China market were among the factors that influenced our bottom line and our stock performance. 
While I view these challenges as short-term, with many beyond our ability to control, it remains our job to create and operate a global company that's built to overcome such headwinds. We expect nothing less of ourselves. 
That is why in 2019, we are initiating definitive actions such as eliminating unnecessary costs and bureaucracy across the company, continuing to develop industry leading and cutting edge propulsion technology, and driving operational and financial performance using proven LEAN systems to meet such challenges with a sense of urgency and discipline. It's also why our new chief executive officer, Richard F. Dauch, is the best person to lead our team in these pursuits. Rick is a seasoned industry executive with an impressive background in operations and as a chief executive officer of both public and private companies. He is an established leader with an open, honest and performance-driven approach. He often sees what others miss; listens to what others don't want to hear; and acts when others don't. He is deliberate, decisive and driven to make a difference. 
He believes, as do I, that Delphi Technologies is keenly positioned to create shareholder value. We have much in our favor, including a broad portfolio of sought-after electric, hybrid, and internal combustion propulsion solutions. Our investment strategies are aimed at driving long-term growth and returns. We are committed to creating a lean, agile enterprise designed to capitalize on shifting market dynamics and deliver profit improving growth over the long term. 
In 2019 we will continue on our journey to a better tomorrow.

In order to help our shareholders better understand our Board practices, we are including the following description of current practices. The Governance Committee periodically reviews these practices. 
Size of the Board 
The Board currently consists of the 10 directors named in the "Election of Directors" section above. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that our Board must consist of a minimum of 2 directors. The exact number of directors is determined from time to time by our full Board. The culture of the Board enables the Board to operate quickly and effectively in making key decisions. Board meetings are conducted in an environment of trust, confidentiality, open dialogue, mutual respect and constructive commentary. 
Leadership Structure 
The Board believes it is important to retain flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chair and Chief Executive Officer in a manner that is in the best interests of the Company. Currently, the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to separate the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chair and to have an independent Non-Executive Chair. The Board believes this leadership structure affords the Company an effective combination of internal and external experience, continuity and independence, which will serve the Board and the Company well. Timothy M. Manganello currently serves as the Company's Independent Non-Executive Chair. 
Director Independence 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         The Board believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent, non-employee directors. Mr. Dauch, our Chief  Executive Officer, is our only non-independent director. When Mr. Nair was appointed to the role of Interim Chief Executive Officer in October 2018, he became the only non-independent director and stepped down from the Compensation and Human  Resources Committee ("Compensation Committee") and Finance Committee of the Board. Following the appointment of Mr. Dauch as our Chief Executive Officer in January 2019, Mr. Nair stepped down as Interim Chief Executive Officer  and has returned to serve as an independent director on the Company's Compensation and Finance Committees.   The Board has determined that each of its non-employee directors qualifies as an independent director under the director independence standards set forth  in the

 BOARD PRACTICES / GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
The Board has determined that (i) each of Mr. Adams, Mr. Cantie, and Ms. Connors meets the heightened independence standards for Audit Committee members set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE, and (ii) each of Mr. Haffner, Mr. Nair (other than during the three month period in 2018 when he served as Interim Chief Executive Officer and stepped down from all Board committees) and Ms. Wright satisfies the heightened independence standards for Compensation Committee members set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. 
Audit Committee Financial Expert 
The Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and that Messrs. Adams and Cantie each qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules and regulations of the SEC and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. 
Director Retirement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the retirement age for directors is 75, unless waived by the Board. No Director who is  or would be over 75 at the expiration of his or her current term may be nominated to a new term, unless the Board waives the retirement age for a specific Director. Once granted, such waiver must be renewed annually.   Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that non-employee  directors who significantly change their primary employment during their tenure as Board members must offer to tender their resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate the

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that non-employee  directors who significantly change their primary employment during their tenure as Board members must offer to tender their resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the new circumstances and make a recommendation to the Board as to  any action to be taken with respect to such offer. 
[END TABLE]
Evaluation of Board Performance 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for coordinating an annual evaluation process by which the directors evaluate the Board's and its Committees' performance and procedures. This self-evaluation is followed by a full Board discussion of the results. Each Committee of the Board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and procedures. 
Board Diversity 
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers individuals with a broad range of business experience and varied backgrounds. Although the Company does not have a formal policy governing diversity among directors, the Board strives to identify candidates with diverse backgrounds. The Board recognizes the value of overall diversity and consider members' and candidates' opinions, perspectives, personal and professional experiences, and backgrounds, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and country of origin. We believe that the judgment and perspectives offered by a diverse board of directors improves the quality of decision making and enhances the Company's business performance. We also believe such diversity can help the Board respond more effectively to the needs of customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.  BOARD PRACTICES / GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
Nomination of Directors 
The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends individuals for membership on the Board and will consider individuals recommended by shareholders. The Committee will review the qualifications and experience of each recommended candidate using the same criteria for candidates proposed by Board members and communicate its decision to the candidate or the person who made the recommendation. The process for evaluating and making recommendations for membership is as follows: 
Shareholder Nominations 
In accordance with procedures set forth in our Memorandum and Articles of Association, shareholders owning at least ten percent of the ordinary shares outstanding and who have the right to vote at general meetings of the Company may propose, and the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider, nominees for election to the Board at the next annual meeting by giving timely written notice to the Corporate Secretary, which must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business 5:00 PM GMT, on March 5, 2020, and no earlier than November 26, 2019. The notice periods may change in accordance with the procedures set out in our Memorandum and Articles of Association. Any such notice must include the name of the nominee, a biographical sketch and resume, contact information, such other background materials as the Nominating and Governance Committee may request and such other information as set out in our Memorandum and Articles. 
Executive Sessions 
Independent directors meet in executive session each Board meeting, without the Chief Executive Officer or any other employees in attendance. The Chair presides over each executive session of the Board. Each Committee also convenes an executive session at which Committee members meet without the Chief Executive Officer or any other employees in attendance. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board takes an active role in risk oversight related to the Company both as a full Board and through its Committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. While the Company's management is responsible for day-to-day management of the various risks facing the Company, the Board is responsible for monitoring management's actions and decisions. The Board, as apprised by the Audit Committee, determines that appropriate risk management and mitigation procedures are in place and that senior management takes the appropriate steps to manage all major risks.  BOARD PRACTICES / GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board believes that each director should hold a meaningful equity position in the Company and has established equity holding requirements for our non-employee directors. The holding requirement for each non-employee director is $500,000. Each new director will have up to five full years from his or her date of appointment to fulfill this holding requirement. Mr. Dauch has five years and the remaining non-employee directors have four years to fulfill this holding requirement. All directors have either satisfied or are on track to satisfy this holding requirement within the applicable period. 
Governance Principles 
The Board adopted a formal statement of Corporate Governance Guidelines, which sets forth the corporate governance practices for Delphi Technologies. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at delphi.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Code of Ethical Business Conduct 
The Company's Code of Ethical Business Conduct applies to all employees and directors, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethical Business Conduct is available on Delphi Technologies' website at delphi.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Code of Ethics" under the heading "Corporate Governance." Copies of our Code of Ethical Business Conduct are also available to any shareholder who submits a request to the Corporate Secretary at Delphi Technologies PLC, 1 Angel Court, 10th Floor, London, EC2R 7HJ, United Kingdom. We intend to satisfy any disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Ethical Business Conduct that applies to our directors or officers. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Anyone who wishes to communicate with the Board or any individual member of the Board (or independent directors as a group) may do so by sending a letter addressed to the director or directors in care of the Corporate Secretary at Delphi Technologies PLC, 1 Angel Court, 10th Floor, London, EC2R 7HJ, United Kingdom. All correspondence, other than items such as junk mail that are unrelated to a director's duties and responsibilities, will be forwarded to the appropriate director or directors.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Elements of Compensation 
During 2018, compensation for non-employee directors consisted of the elements described in the table below. We do not pay any other meeting fees. The Chair of the Board and Committee Chairs received additional compensation due to the increased workload and additional responsibilities associated with these positions. In particular, Mr. Manganello's compensation as Chair of the Board reflects the additional time commitment for this role, which includes, among other responsibilities, attending additional Committee meetings, meeting with the Company's investors, and attending additional meetings with the Company's senior management, including the CEO.

 Compensation and  Human Resources Committee Chair Fee      20,000   
 All Other Committee  Chair Fees      15,000   
[END TABLE]
From the date of the Company's complete legal and structure separation from Delphi Automotive PLC (now known as Aptiv PLC, or "Aptiv") (the "Spin-Off") until April 2018, each director's board retainer was paid 60% in equity in the form of Company restricted stock units ("RSUs") that vest one year after grant and 40% in cash paid quarterly. Additional committee and chairman fees were paid in cash. Following April 2018, total compensation, inclusive of committee and chairman fees, are paid 60% in equity in the form of RSUs and 40% in cash paid quarterly. A director may elect to receive a greater portion of his or her compensation in the form of RSUs. An annual grant of RSUs is made on the day of the Annual Meeting which vests on the day before the next Annual Meeting. Any non-employee director who joins the Board, other than in connection with the Annual Meeting, will receive prorated cash compensation and a prorated grant of RSUs, based on the date the director joins the Board. 
How Restricted Stock Units Work 
Each RSU represents the right to receive one ordinary share upon vesting. RSUs accrue dividends, which vest and pay out if and to the extent that the underlying RSUs vest and pay out. RSUs granted are determined as follows:

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Overview 
In this section, we describe and analyze: (1) the material components of the executive compensation programs for the "named executive officers," or "NEOs;" and (2) the material compensation decisions made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") and the key factors considered in making those decisions. 
Named Executive Officers 
For fiscal year 2018, the NEOs of Delphi Technologies were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Liam Butterworth, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Hari N. Nair, Interim Chief Executive Officer  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vivid Sehgal, Chief Financial Officer

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mary E. Gustanski, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• James D. Harrington, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer   
[END TABLE]
Significant 2018 Developments 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, several events occurred which impacted compensation decisions with respect to certain of the Company's NEOs. In October, Mr. Butterworth resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors. Mr. Nair served as Interim Chief Executive Officer for the remainder of the year, succeeding Mr. Butterworth. Due to the interim nature of his appointment, Mr. Nair did not receive an Annual Incentive Target or Long-Term Incentive Target Plan Award pursuant to the Company's incentive compensation programs described more fully below, but instead was compensated in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement. Following Mr. Butterworth's resignation, the Company entered into a retention agreement with Mr. Sehgal. For additional details on Mr. Nair's compensation and Mr. Sehgal's retention agreement, see "Nair Employment Agreement" and "Sehgal Retention Award" below. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Strategy 
The Committee, in consultation with management and the Committee's independent compensation consultant, oversaw our executive compensation philosophy and reviewed and approved compensation for our executive officers other than the CEO (including cash compensation, equity incentives and benefits). The full Board of Directors approves the CEO's compensation following a review by the Committee. 
Our executive compensation programs reflect our pay-for-performance philosophy, which we believe encourages our executive officers to make sound decisions to drive short-term and long-term shareholder value creation. The Committee utilizes a combination of fixed and variable pay elements in order to achieve the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Support the Company's overall business strategy and results to drive long-term shareholder value creation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Emphasize a pay-for-performance culture by linking incentive compensation to defined short- and long-term performance  goals;  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate key executives by providing competitive total compensation opportunities; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executive and investor interests by establishing market- and investor-relevant metrics that drive shareholder  value creation.  
[END TABLE]
Our goal for target total direct compensation (base salary, target annual and target long-term incentives) for officers, including the NEOs, is to approximate the median (50th percentile) of the market. Compensation for individual roles could be positioned higher or lower than the market median where the Company believes it is appropriate, considering multiple factors such as each executive's roles and responsibilities, labor market dynamics, the individual's performance over time, and the experience and critical skills the individual could bring to his or her role with the Company. 
Consideration of Risk 
Our executive compensation programs are balanced and also focused on the long term so that our named executives can achieve higher compensation through consistent superior performance over sustained periods of time. In addition, large amounts of compensation are usually realizable only upon the achievement of long-term performance goals, providing strong incentives to manage for the long term while avoiding excessive risk-taking in the short term. Our equity awards also have specific holding requirements for senior executives, which also discourages excessive risk taking. 
Balance Between Company and Business Unit Results 
The Committee believes that our corporate executives share the responsibility to support the Company's overall goals and performance. This compensation philosophy is most clearly reflected in our annual equity incentive grants, which tie executives' pay across our businesses to overall Company performance. In addition, the Committee believes that there should also be clear accountability for the performance of one's business division or function. As a result, under our annual incentive plan, those executives who had roles associated with our Aftermarket and Powertrain divisions are compensated based in-part upon the results of their respective divisions, while our corporate executives, including our NEOs, are compensated based upon overall Company results. 
Key Considerations in Setting Pay 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we received favorable support from over 94% of votes cast on our executive compensation program, which support we believe is a strong affirmation for our executive compensation program and pay-for-performance philosophy as more fully outlined below. The Committee intends to consider the outcome of future say-on-pay votes and other shareholder feedback when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers and will make adjustments to support Delphi Technologies' strategies and to remain market competitive. 
This past year was a difficult one for the Company, and management's execution of the Company's operating plan fell substantially short of expectations. As a result, the Committee approved pay-outs under the Annual Incentive Plan that were significantly less than target. 
2018 Peer Group Analysis 
Following the Spin-Off in December 2017, we approved a peer group consisting of the following 17 companies, whose aggregate profile was more comparable to Delphi Technologies as a stand-alone company as compared to the peer group used by Aptiv in determining 2017 compensation. This peer group was used to determine target compensation and set salaries and incentive targets for executives during 2018.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

In January 2019, as part of a periodic review of our peer group, we made further adjustments so that the group's aggregate profile continues to be comparable to the Company's and will use the revised peer group to determine 2019 compensation, see "2019 Compensation Decisions – Adjustments to Peer Group." 
2018 Performance Metrics 
We believe that Delphi Technologies' strategic, operational and financial performance over time, as evidenced by the following financial metrics, is reflected in its results and returns to shareholders. Accordingly, in 2018 we used these metrics to evaluate performance on a Company or division level under our annual and long-term incentive plans for executives (for detail regarding the calculation of each metric, see "Definition of Non-GAAP Performance Measures"):

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Annual Target Total Compensation Mix 
A majority of each NEO's total compensation opportunity is composed of performance-based pay. Our annual incentive awards and the performance-based RSU component of the long-term incentive awards are considered performance-based pay because the payout of these awards is dependent on the achievement of specified performance goals at Corporate, Division and/or individual levels. The time-based portion of the RSU awards is retentive while also aligning with Company performance as the final value realized is based on the Company's share price. 
The mix of compensation in 2018 for Mr. Butterworth and other NEOs is shown below and was calculated by dividing each compensation element by total target compensation. Target award level opportunities do not include any special one-time grants. Actual base salary and target compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table or 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table may reflect lower amounts if the NEO did not serve in such capacity for the full year period or if the NEO received an adjustment in base salary during the year. COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Annual Target Total Compensation Opportunities 
The following table depicts 2018 target annualized total compensation opportunities for the NEOs (other than Mr. Nair) based on their base salary as in effect at December 31, 2018. Actual base salary and target compensation earned during 2018 and as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table or 2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards Table is lower than the target opportunities for those NEOs who received an adjustment in base salary during the year, as discussed below.

2018 Annual Compensation Determination 
Individual base salaries and annual incentive targets for the NEOs were established based on the scope of each NEO's responsibilities, individual performance, experience and market pay data. 
Base Salaries. Base salary is intended to reward and be commensurate with each NEO's responsibilities, individual performance and experience. We periodically make base salary adjustments, and review  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
compensation competitiveness at least annually. As a result of our review during 2018, we made the following adjustments to each NEO's base salary:

2018 Annual Incentive Plan Awards. Our Annual Incentive Plan is designed to motivate our executives, including our NEOs, to drive earnings, cash flow and profitable growth by measuring the executives' performance against goals at the Corporate and relevant Division levels. The individual annual incentive target for each executive can be adjusted based on the executive's position, individual performance, and the size and scope of his or her responsibilities. Final payouts can range from 0% to 200% of each NEO's annual incentive target. The target annual incentive as a percentage of base salary for each NEO is reflected above. 
The Committee, working with management and its independent compensation consultant, set the underlying performance metrics and objectives for the preliminary annual incentive plan payout levels based on identified annual business objectives. The target annual incentive awards were initially funded under a performance formula at 1% of our net income, up to a maximum of $12 million per individual participant. 
For 2018, each executive's award payout was determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted Net Income (Corporate) or Operating Income (Division)      50%       50%       50%  
 Adjusted Net Income (Corporate) or Operating Income (Division)      50%       50%       50%  
 Bookings/Revenue      10        10        10   
 In  addition, discretionary adjustments can be applied based on qualitative factors and considerations.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For detail regarding the calculation of each metric, see "Definition of Non-GAAP Performance  Measures."  
[END TABLE]
Performance below the minimum threshold results in no payout and performance above the maximum level is capped at a maximum total payout of 200% of the target award. For the Adjusted Net Income/Operating  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Income and Cash Flow Before Financing (CFBF) /Simplified Operating Cash Flow (SOCF) metrics the threshold, target and maximum payout levels were 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively. Bookings/Revenue is treated differently in that if the Bookings/Revenue targets are achieved, the target payout for that metric is paid. If the Bookings/Revenue targets are not achieved, no portion of the Bookings/Revenue award is paid. 
The 2018 Corporate performance targets and actual performance by metric applicable to our NEOs were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Target        $413          $213          100/91%             
 Actual        389         124         100/91%             
 Payout Factor        81%          0%          100%             
[END TABLE]
With respect to the performance levels required for target payment, 2018 overall performance at the Corporate level produced a below-target payout of 50%. 
Following the determination of payout levels for the Corporate and Division metrics, the Committee assessed the eligible NEOs' performance with respect to the Strategic Results Modifiers ("SRM"). As part of the focus on strategic priorities, the SRM was approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year as part of the Annual Incentive Plan design. The SRM can range in the aggregate from plus or minus 10% of the total Annual Incentive Plan target opportunity. The SRM allows the Committee to consider strategic factors in addition to the financial metrics under the Annual Incentive Plan. In determining the final individual payouts, the Committee evaluated each eligible NEO's individual achievements along with his or her performance against the SRM assessment. The Committee did not elect to increase or decrease any NEO's award based on the SRM assessment. 
As a result of the analysis described above, the Committee approved the following 2018 annual incentive award payments for the eligible NEOs. As Mr. Butterworth resigned prior to the end of the year, he forfeited any payout in respect of his 2018 award under the Annual Incentive Plan.

Long-Term Incentive Awards. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is designed to reward performance on long-term strategic metrics and to attract, retain and motivate participants. 
Annual equity awards include both performance-based and time-based RSUs. The performance-based RSUs, which make up 75% of the NEOs' long-term awards, are settled after the results of a three-year performance period are determined. The time-based RSUs, which make up 25% of the NEOs' long-term awards, vest ratably over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The 2018 grant vests at the end of 2020 and will be settled in early 2021 after the outcomes of the performance period are determined and approved.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Each NEO may receive from 0% to 200% of his or her target performance-based RSU award based on performance against the following company-wide performance metrics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Average Return on  Net Assets (RONA))        50%  
 Cumulative Adjusted  Net Income (NI)        25

The Long-Term Incentive Plan allows for dividend equivalents to accrue on unvested RSUs; however, the dividend equivalents vest and pay out only if and to the extent that the underlying RSUs vest and pay out. 
2018 Grants Under the LTIP. The Committee established the 2018 annual target long-term incentive awards set forth in the table below taking into account scope of responsibilities, individual performance, retention considerations and market compensation data. In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off the Compensation Committee approved a one-time award, the Founders Grant, under the LTIP. For a description of the Founders Grant, see "Special One-time Awards," below. Mr. Nair did not receive a long-term incentive award under the LTIP but instead was entitled under the terms of his employment agreement to receive a fixed amount of ordinary shares for each month of service as Interim CEO, see "Nair Employment Agreement," below.

Special One-Time Awards 
Founders Grants. In February 2018, the Committee made Founders Grants under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan to Messrs. Sehgal, Clarke and Harrington and Ms. Gustanski (Mr. Butterworth received a Founders Grant in December 2017, which he forfeited as a result of his resignation). The awards consist of time-based RSUs that vest one-third on each of February 28, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and performance-based RSUs that will be measured based upon the Company's total relative shareholder return from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The target value of the Founders Grants (dollar amounts were converted to a number of  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
share equivalent units based on the average trading price for the 10 trading days prior to the effective date of the awards) made to the NEO's other than Messrs. Butterworth and Nair were as follows:

Sehgal Retention Award. On November 7, 2018, the Board entered into a Retention Agreement (the "Retention Agreement") with the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal. Pursuant to the Retention Agreement, Mr. Sehgal will be entitled to receive a retention bonus of $1,500,000 (the "Retention Bonus") payable in a single installment on February 28, 2020. If Mr. Sehgal's employment is terminated other than as a result of a death, disability, termination by the Company without cause, or termination by Mr. Sehgal for good reason (in each case a "Qualifying Termination") (all as more fully described in the Retention Agreement), he will have no rights to any portion of the Retention Bonus that has not vested as of such termination. If, however, his employment is terminated as a result of a Qualifying Termination, Mr. Sehgal will receive the full amount of the Retention Bonus. In addition, the Retention Agreement provides that in the event that after February 28, 2020, Mr. Sehgal voluntarily terminates his employment or there is a Qualifying Termination, a pro-rata portion (based on time of service during the applicable vesting period) of any equity awards granted pursuant to the LTIP that have been outstanding for at least one year as of such employment termination date will vest and become payable on the date and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable equity award. 
2016-2018 Performance-Based RSUs 
In February 2019, we paid out the performance-based RSUs for the 2016-2018 performance period. Due to Mr. Butterworth's resignation, he forfeited any payout in respect of these awards. As Messrs. Harrington and Sehgal did not join the Company until late 2017, they did not receive a grant of 2016-2018 performance-based RSUs. The following tables set forth: (1) the threshold, target and maximum levels, as well as the actual level achieved, for each performance metric; and (2) for each eligible NEO, the target total number of performance-based RSUs and actual number of performance-based RSUs earned. Because the performance period included both periods before and after the Spin-Off, the calculation of achieved results against each performance metric is determined by reference to the combined consolidated results of operations for both Aptiv and the Company for the two year period ended December 31, 2017 as if the Spin-Off had not occurred, and the results of operations for the Company for the one year period ended December 31, 2018.

Definition of Non-GAAP Performance Measures 
The following non-GAAP financial measures are used in establishing target performance levels under our incentive plans. In determining final awards, the Committee retains the discretion to make adjustments for incentive plan purposes to eliminate the impact (positive or negative) of items the Committee believes are not representative of management's execution of the Company's operating plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to the Company before discontinued operations,  restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Bookings/Revenue is based: (a) for the Powertrain Division, on future business booked in the current fiscal  year; (b) for the Aftermarket Division on the level of revenue as compared to the approved target for that year; and (c) for Corporate, the weighted average of the level of bookings in the Powertrain Division and revenue as compared to  target in the Aftermarket Division. In general, in the case of bookings, in order to achieve the target performance level, a specified percentage of planned future sales for the next two calendar years must be booked by the end of the measurement  period, in this case the end of fiscal year 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash Flow Before Financing (CFBF) represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing  operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Return on Net Assets is defined as tax-affected operating income (net income before interest expense), other  income (expense) net, income tax expense, equity income (loss) net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations net of tax, divided by average continuing operations net working capital plus average continuing operations net property, plant and  equipment, measured each calendar year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Simplified Operating Cash Flow (SOCF) is defined, on a Divisional basis, as earnings before interest, tax,  depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), plus or minus changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable, less capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset dispositions, plus restructuring expense, less cash expenditures  for restructuring.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total Shareholder Return was measured by comparing the average closing price per share of the Company's  ordinary shares for all available trading days in December of the final year of the performance period to the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for all available trading days in December of the year prior to the  beginning of the performance period, including the reinvestment of dividends, relative to the companies in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index. Prior to the Spin-Off, Aptiv measured total shareholder return by comparing the average closing price per  share of Aptiv's ordinary shares for all available trading days in the fourth quarter  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   of the final year of the performance period to the average closing price per share of Aptiv's ordinary shares for all available  trading days in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the beginning of the performance period, including the reinvestment of dividends, relative to the companies in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index. In the case of awards granted by Aptiv and  converted and assumed by the Company following the Spin-Off, for which the performance period began prior to the Spin-Off but concludes following the Spin-Off, total shareholder return is measured by using a weighted average of both methodologies.  For example in the case of the 2016-2018 Performance-Based RSUs which were settled in February 2019, performance was measured using a weighted average measure of performance, two-thirds of which is based on comparing the average closing price per  share of Aptiv's ordinary shares for all available trading days in the fourth quarter of 2015 to the average closing price of Aptiv's ordinary shares for all available trading days in the fourth quarter of 2017, and one-third of which is  based on comparing the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for all available trading days in the month of December of 2017 to the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for all  available trading days in the month of December of 2018, in each case including the reinvestment of dividends, and relative to the companies in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index for the same period using the same methodology.  
[END TABLE]
Other Compensation 
Additional compensation and benefit programs available to our NEOs are described below. Only those benefits and policies offered to the other salaried employee populations are available to our NEOs. 
Defined Contribution Plans and U.S. Salaried Retirement Savings Program ("SRSP"). Our employees are able to participate in defined contribution plans. Mr. Butterworth did, and Mr. Clarke and Mr. Sehgal continue to, participate in Delphi Technologies' defined contribution plan for UK employees. Ms. Gustanski and Mr. Harrington participate, and Mr. Nair participated, in our broad-based and tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the SRSP, which is a qualified plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). All contributions to the SRSP are subject to any contribution limits imposed by the Code. 
Salaried Retirement Equalization Savings Program ("SRESP"). Under the SRESP, eligible U.S. employees receive Delphi contributions in excess of the limits imposed upon the SRSP by the Code. No guaranteed or above-market rates are earned; the investment options available are a subset of those available to all employees under the SRSP. Additional details regarding benefits and payouts under this plan are provided in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" section. 
Other Benefits. We provide additional benefits, such as relocation and expatriate benefits to our NEOs, which in general, are the same benefits as those provided to similarly situated non-officer employees. Additional details are covered in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table". 
Nair Employment Agreement 
The Company entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Mr. Nair in conjunction with his appointment to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective October 5, 2018. The Employment Agreement provided Mr. Nair with a monthly base salary of $183,125 and monthly awards of 7,740 ordinary shares. The grant of ordinary shares relating to employment from the period beginning on October 5, 2018 through January 5, 2019 was awarded to Mr. Nair on January 5, 2019 in the amount of 23,220 shares. The shares were fully vested from and after the date of grant. As this award relates to compensation for service during 2018, these shares are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Both the monthly base salary and monthly award were to be pro-rated for each partial month of employment. The Employment Agreement did not have a fixed term or expiration date. The Employment Agreement also provided for Mr. Nair's participation in the benefit package offered to U.S. executives of the Company, the Company's tax equalization program for employees seconded from the United States to the United Kingdom, where the Company's principal executive office is located, and related tax preparation assistance. Mr. Nair was also eligible to receive payments under the Company's Executive Severance Plan or Change of Control Plan described elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, but did not participate in the Company's Annual or Long-Term Incentive Plans (other than the monthly award of shares). Mr. Nair's Employment Agreement terminated on January 6, 2019 and Mr. Nair resumed his status as an independent member of the Board. Mr. Nair did not receive any severance or other termination benefits in connection with the termination of his Employment Agreement. 
Governance Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. To support better alignment of our executives' interests with those of our shareholders, our Board believes that our officers should maintain an appropriate level of equity interest in Delphi Technologies. To that end, our Board has adopted the following stock ownership guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO is required to hold a minimum of six times base salary in Delphi Technologies shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our other most senior elected officers (generally, our other Section 16 officers, including all of our NEOs other  than the CEO) are required to hold a minimum of three times their base salaries in Delphi Technologies shares; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our elected Corporate staff officers are required to hold a minimum of one time their base salaries in Delphi  Technologies shares.  
[END TABLE]
Our officers, including our NEOs, are expected to fulfill the ownership requirement within five years from the time they are appointed to their position. Until such time as the required holding is met, officers may not sell stock, subject to limited exceptions. Once the ownership requirement has been met, an officer may sell stock, provided, however, that the minimum ownership requirement must continue to be met. The Committee reviews the ownership level for covered executives each year. 
Clawback. As a matter of policy, if our financial statements are materially misstated or in material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws, then the Committee will review the circumstances and determine if such misstatement or non-compliance was the result of misconduct by any participant in our incentive compensation plans. If the Committee determines that a participant knowingly engaged in and/or permitted or failed to prevent the misconduct, such misconduct was attributable to such participant's gross negligence or such participant is otherwise subject to the automatic forfeiture provisions (and not otherwise exempted) under United States federal securities laws, then in each such case, the participant will be required to repay any amounts paid to him or her under our incentive compensation plans relating to the periods impacted by such misstatement or noncompliance. In addition, the participant may forfeit certain future awards. 
Restrictive Covenants. All executives, including the NEOs, are required to sign confidentiality and non-interference agreements in order to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The non-interference agreements include non-compete and non-solicitation covenants, which prohibit executives from: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Working for a competitor or otherwise directly or indirectly engaging in competition with us for 12 months after leaving  Delphi Technologies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Soliciting or hiring employees for 24 months after leaving Delphi Technologies; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Soliciting customers for 24 months after leaving Delphi Technologies.  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
If the terms of the confidentiality and non-interference agreements are violated, Delphi Technologies has the right to cancel or rescind any final Long-Term Incentive Plan award, consistent with applicable law. 
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups. We do not provide any excise tax gross-ups specific to our officer population. Certain expatriate policy and relocation provisions, applicable to all salaried employees, allow for tax gross-ups as reimbursement for additional taxes or expenses incurred due to expatriate status or relocation expenses. 
No Hedging/No Pledging. The Company prohibits its directors, officers and employees from engaging in transactions having the effect of hedging the unvested portion of any equity or equity-linked award. In addition, the Company prohibits its directors, officers and employees from purchasing Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account. The Company also prohibits its directors, officers and employees from pledging the Company's securities as collateral for a loan. The Company's Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading is available on delphi.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Independent Compensation Consultant. The Committee retained Compensation Advisory Partners LLC ("CAP") as its independent compensation consultant at the time of the Spin-Off. CAP served in such capacity until the Committee decided to transition the work to Meridian Compensation Partners LLC ("Meridian"), beginning in September 2018. The scope of the work done by the consultants during 2018 included the following:

The Committee assessed the independence of CAP and Meridian pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent either consulting firm from independently representing the Committee. During the time each firm served as a consultant to the Committee, neither performed other services for the Company, and going forward, Meridian will not do so without the prior consent of the Chair of the Committee. Each firm met with the Committee Chair and the full Committee outside the presence of management. In addition, each participated in, and Meridian continues to participate in, Committee meetings and, when requested by the Committee Chair, in the preparatory meetings and the executive sessions. 
Compensation Risk Assessment. In 2017, the Aptiv Compensation Committee commissioned a risk assessment of its executive compensation programs, which programs were substantially mirrored by the Company following completion of the Spin-Off. In 2018, following the transition to Meridian as the Company's independent compensation consultant, the Committee asked Meridian to conduct a market review of the Company's compensation programs to identify any areas of concern or significant gaps from market practices in the Company's compensation policies, practices and programs. Although Meridian's market review provided insights considered by the Committee to further refine the Company's compensation programs for 2019 (see, "2019 Compensation Decisions"), the review did not identify any significant gaps from market practices that in Meridian's view encourage excessive risk taking. Based on the 2017 assessment and the Meridian market  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
review, the Committee concluded that the Company's compensation policies, practices and programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company or its subsidiaries. 
The assessment and Meridian's subsequent market review included consideration of the Company's incentive plan structures, pay practices, governance process including the Committee's oversight of such programs and interviews with executives representing Accounting, Finance, HR and Internal Audit. As part of this process, the following risk mitigating factors were considered with respect to our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive pay positioning at the 50th percentile of the market;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mix of fixed versus variable, cash versus equity-based and short-term versus long-term compensation with an emphasis on  long-term compensation programs comprised of equity-based pay;

• Incentive award opportunities, with performance-based awards capped at two times the target amount, that span both  annual and overlapping, multiyear time periods and with payout determined based on a range of financial metrics (including total shareholder return);

• Application of a clawback policy; and

Tax and Accounting Considerations. Prior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code generally limited the tax deductibility of compensation paid to the chief executive officer and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (excluding the CFO) that exceeds $1 million in any taxable year unless the compensation over $1 million qualified as "performance-based" within the meaning of Section 162(m). The ability to rely on the "performance-based" compensation exception under Section 162(m) was eliminated in 2017 and the $1 million limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all named executive officers (including the principal financial officer). As a result, we may no longer take a deduction for any compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million unless the compensation qualifies for the "performance-based" compensation exception and qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place on November 2, 2017. While we may qualify for transition relief, we cannot guarantee that will be the case and we expect that for those executives who are employed in the United States, compensation in excess of $1 million will no longer be deductible, however the Committee has determined that in many instances the benefit of such tax deductibility is outweighed by the need for flexibility or the attainment of other objectives. Accordingly, the Committee will continue from time to time to award compensation that is not tax deductible if the Committee determines that it is in our and our shareholders' best interests. 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. For 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $19,153 and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $7,107,925. Based on this information, for 2018 our CEO's annual total compensation was 371 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees. In making this calculation, we used the following methodology: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total CEO compensation was determined by aggregating the total compensation amounts paid to each of Mr. Butterworth  and Mr. Nair in respect of their service as Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer, respectively. In the case of Mr. Butterworth, we used the amount  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   shown in the "Total" column in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. In the case of  Mr. Nair, we used the amount shown in such column but less the amounts that were attributable to Mr. Nair's service as a non-employee director during the first part of 2018. For more detail on the determination of these amounts, see  "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the accompanying explanatory notes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that, as of October 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 19,199 full-time,  part-time, and temporary global employees. To identify the median employee from our global employee population, we first determined each employee's taxable wages as of October 31, 2018, as reflected in our payroll records and systems. We  then identified our median employee from our global employee population based on this compensation measure. We did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee. The median employee's total compensation represents  the amount of such employee's compensation as of October 31, 2018 that would have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K if the employee was a NEO for  2018.  
[END TABLE]
Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, as well as differences in business models and workforce strategies, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
This information is being provided for compliance purposes. Neither the Committee nor management of the Company used the pay ratio measure in making compensation decisions. 
2019 Compensation Decisions 
At the December 2018 Compensation Committee meeting, the Committee as advised by its independent compensation consultant, Meridian, refined the peer group used to determine 2019 compensation and approved certain adjustments to the Company's Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan, which became effective in January 2019. These adjustments were made to reinforce and strengthen our pay-for performance philosophy and to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• More closely align with the Company's go-forward strategic plan as a standalone company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Create a simpler program, which is easily understood by participants and more closely aligns with our strategic  priorities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deliver competitive compensation opportunities for executives, within appropriate cost controls; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consider incentive metrics and mix of vehicles that balances the Company's need to both retain and motivate its  executives.  
[END TABLE]
Adjustments to Peer Group. As part of a periodic review of our peer group, the Committee made some adjustments to ensure that the group's aggregate profile continues to be comparable to the Company's, including that the peer companies more closely reflect the size and scale of the Company's operations. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2018, the median revenue of the newly approved peer group and  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
the Company was $4,187 million and $4,858 million, respectively; placing Delphi in the 54th percentile of its peers. Below is the peer group to be used to determine 2019 compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.     Navistar International Corporation 
 Autoliv, Inc.     Oshkosh Corporation 
 BorgWarner Inc.     Pentair PLC 
 Colfax Corporation.     Rockwell Automation, Inc. 
 Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.     Sensata Technologies Holding, Inc. 
 Dana Incorporated     Tenneco Inc. 
 Dover Corporation     The Timken Company 
 Flowserve Corporation     TI Fluid Systems plc 
 Garrett Motion Inc.     Visteon Corporation 
 Meritor, Inc.     WABCO Holdings Inc. 
[END TABLE]
Adjustments to Annual Incentive Plan. For 2019, the Bookings/Revenue metric will no longer be used to assess performance under the plan; during 2018 performance against this metric had a minimal impact in calculating payout levels. Instead the remaining two metrics: Adjusted Net Income (Corporate)/ Operating Income (Division) and Cash Flow Before Financing (Corporate)/Simplified Operating Cash Flow (Division) will each be weighted 50% in determining performance. For a more detailed description of these metrics, see "Definition of Non-GAAP Performance Measures." 
Adjustments to Long-Term Incentive Plan. The LTIP program will continue to be comprised of both time-based and performance-based RSUs. However, beginning in 2019, the mix between these two elements will now be 67% performance-based RSUs and 33% time-based RSUs for the NEOs and all other members of the Executive Leadership Team. The time-based RSUs will continue to vest ratably over three years while the performance-based RSUs will continue to vest based on a three-year performance period. The performance-based RSUs will payout between 0%-200% of the award based on performance against two company-wide performance metrics: 50% Average Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and 50% Relative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) as compared to the 2018 plan which was composed of 50% Average Return on Net Assets, 25% Cumulative Adjusted Net Income and 25% RTSR. The comparator group for the RTSR will change for 2019 from the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index to a custom peer group of 22 companies classified in the "Auto Parts & Industry" GICS sub-industry. 
Additional information regarding the above adjustments (including the calculation of each metric) will be provided in connection with the discussion of 2019 compensation decisions in next year's proxy statement. 
CEO Employment Agreement. On January 7, 2019, Mr. Dauch began his appointment as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Dauch's employment agreement remains in effect until the date specified by one party to the other by means of a written notice. The agreement sets forth the terms of Mr. Dauch's compensation, which includes: (1) a base salary of $1,100,000 per year; (2) a target award under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2019 equal to 125% of base salary; (3) an equity award under the Long-Term Incentive Plan for the performance period 2019-2021 valued at $5,500,000 in the form of time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs; and (4) a one-time inducement award of a non-qualified stock option to purchase ordinary shares of the Company, which option had an approximate value of $5,000,000 (determined on a Black-Scholes basis) at an exercise price equal to the  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
fair market value of an ordinary share (determined as the average of the high and low trading prices for an ordinary share on the grant date). The option becomes exercisable in equal parts annually over a 5 year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date (and accelerated vesting upon termination of employment in limited circumstances). The option will be exercisable (subject to vesting) for a period of 10 years after the grant date, subject to earlier expiration in the event of termination of employment. 
The agreement also provides for Mr. Dauch's participation in the benefit package offered to U.S.-based executives of the Company, including the Company's Change-in-Control Severance Plan (see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control"), the Company's tax equalization program for employees seconded from the United States to the United Kingdom, where the Company's principal corporate office is currently located, tax preparation assistance, use of an apartment or other appropriate accommodations while Mr. Dauch is in London on Company business (for a period of up to twelve months after his employment commencement date), expense reimbursements, and a one-time perquisite allowance of $40,000. Mr. Dauch has waived his right to receive benefits under the Change-in-Control Severance Plan in the event that a change in control occurs as a result of a transaction between the Company and American Axle (or any of its affiliates). Mr. Dauch is not entitled to severance benefits under the Company's Executive Severance Plan; however, if his employment is terminated as a result of termination by the Company without cause or by him for good reason, he will be entitled to the following: (1) a cash severance payment in an amount equal to (A) the sum of (I) his base salary plus (II) his target annual bonus for the year in which his termination occurs, (B) divided by 12 and (C) multiplied by 18, and (2) a prorated portion of his then outstanding long-term incentive awards based on the portion of the vesting or performance period, as applicable, elapsed prior to this termination date. The foregoing severance benefits are subject to the signing of a general release. 
In connection with his employment, Mr. Dauch also entered into a Confidentiality and Noninterference Agreement that includes confidentiality provisions (that apply during employment and indefinitely thereafter), non-solicitation and non-interference provisions (that apply during employment and for twenty four months after termination) and non-competition provisions (that apply during employment and for twelve months after termination).  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
We, the undersigned members of the Compensation Committee, have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on such review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Although Mr. Nair acted as part of the Compensation Committee and reviewed and approved this Compensation  Discussion and Analysis, Mr. Nair did not serve on the Committee during his tenure as Interim CEO, and did not participate as a Committee or Board member in the determination of the terms of his Employment Agreement or the approval of any  payments of salary or awards of ordinary shares made to him.  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
As noted above, Hari N. Nair, prior to his appointment as Interim CEO, was an independent director and served on the Company's Compensation Committee. Upon his appointment as Interim CEO in October of 2018, Mr. Nair stepped down from his service on the Compensation Committee while continuing to serve as a management director on the Board. Accordingly, at no time did any member of the Company's Compensation Committee simultaneously serve during the fiscal year or at any other time as an officer or employee of the Company, nor have any other relationship required to be disclosed by the Company to comply with the disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. No executive officer of the Company served as a member of the compensation committee (or the board of directors or other board committee performing similar functions) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company.  2018 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 
The table below sets forth specified information regarding the compensation of the individuals (NEOs) who served for 2018 as President and Chief Executive Officer (Liam Butterworth until his resignation in October 2018, and thereafter, Hari Nair as Interim Chief Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Vivid Sehgal), and our next three most highly compensated executive officers (Michael J.P. Clarke, Mary E. Gustanski, and James D. Harrington).

   other than Messrs. Butterworth, and Nair, on February 28, 2018, the actual payouts will be based on three  performance metrics (Average Return on Net Assets, Cumulative Net Income and relative TSR) during the performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The performance-based RSUs granted as part of the Founders Grant vest  in December 2020 (together with the time-based RSUs granted the same date) and will be measured based upon the Company's total relative shareholder return from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020.

(3)  This column shows the number of time-based RSUs granted to our NEOs (other than Mr. Nair) in 2018 pursuant to our  Long-Term Incentive Plan excluding dividend equivalents. These time-based RSUs vest ratably over three years on the first, second and third anniversary dates of the date of grant. With respect to Mr. Nair, this column shows 3,211 time-based  RSUs, exclusive of dividend equivalents, attributable to his service as a non-employee director which vest on April 24, 2019, and 23,220 ordinary shares issued to Mr. Nair on January 5, 2019 as compensation for his service as Interim  CEO during 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  This column reflects the grant date fair value of each award determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718,  including, for performance-based awards, the target outcome of the performance conditions, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures and dividend equivalents. Except for the performance-based RSUs based on relative TSR (generally 25% of the  performance-based RSUs other than those under the Founders Grant which were based solely on relative TSR), the grant date value for the equity awards was determined based on the grant date closing price of our stock as quoted on the New York Stock  Exchange. If the grant is issued on a non-trading day, the grant date closing price was deemed to be the closing price of our stock on the last preceding date on which any reported sale occurred. The grant date closing price for awards made in  February 2018 was $47.75, for awards made in April 2018 was $48.98, and for awards made in January 2019 was $14.68. The grant date fair value for the relative TSR performance-based RSUs granted in February 2018 was determined using a Monte Carlo  simulation and was based on a price of $52.78.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
The SRESP is a non-qualified deferred compensation program available to all US-based employees whose compensation exceeds the IRS thresholds, including certain of the NEOs. Under the SRESP, participants receive Delphi contributions in excess of the limits imposed upon the SRSP, our 401(k) plan, by the Internal Revenue Code. 
Plan Benefits. Employees who were eligible for SRESP deferrals in 2018 were permitted to defer additional income above $275,000, which is the maximum income deferral level imposed upon the SRSP by the Internal Revenue Code in 2017, into a SRESP deferral account. Ms. Gustanski, and Messrs. Harrington and Nair were the only NEOs eligible to participate in 2018. Eligible employees also received the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All SRESP-eligible employees receive a Company contribution of 4% of their base salary and annual incentive award. This  contribution occurs even if the individual does not elect to make deferrals into the SRESP; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Eligible employees who made deferral contributions under the SRESP received an additional Company matching contribution  of 50% on the individual's voluntary deferrals up to 7% of the base salary and annual incentive award over the qualified plan limit, which constitutes a maximum contribution by the Company of 3.5% of each eligible employee's base salary.   
[END TABLE]
Investment Options. Participants in the SRESP may select investment options for their deferred amounts. The investment options consist of a small selection of index mutual funds and do not offer any guaranteed or above-market returns. 
Deferral Election Process. The SRESP deferral election process is conducted prior to the year in which eligible income is earned. For the 2018 plan, deferral elections were required to be made by December 2017. During this process, eligible employees were allowed to make deferral elections related to their 2018 base salary and any annual incentive award based on 2018 performance that would be scheduled to be paid in 2019 (but no later than March 15, 2019). 
Distributions. Eligible employees must also elect a distribution date for their deferred amounts. A base salary deferral must remain deferred for a minimum of one year, and any annual incentive deferral must remain deferred for a minimum of two years. 
Vesting. All employee deferrals and Company contributions are immediately vested.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Severance Plan and Change in Control Provisions 
The Company maintains an Executive Severance Plan for qualifying employees. During 2018, the only applicable change in control provisions were (i) the Executive Change in Control Severance Plan ("Change in Control Plan") adopted upon completion of the Spin-Off in November 2017 for qualifying employees, and (ii) those provided in the Company's incentive plans. Each executive who participates in the annual Long-Term Incentive Plan equity grant must sign a grant agreement, as well as a non-interference and confidentiality agreement, described above in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. The non-interference agreement includes both non-compete and non-solicitation covenants. 
The following definitions are applicable to the discussion of these arrangements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Qualifying Separation" means a separation of employment, including following a Change in Control, but in any  event not by the Company for Cause and not as a result of a voluntary termination by the executive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Change in Control" means a change in ownership or control of the Company resulting in (i) any person or  group other than the Company or an employee benefit plan acquiring securities of the Company possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the Company's equity securities outstanding after such acquisition; (ii) the  majority of the board as of the date of the Spin-Off is replaced by persons whose election was not approved by a majority of the incumbent board; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, in one or a series of  related transactions, to any person or group other than the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Cause" means with respect to any executive (i) the indictment for a felony or for any other crime that  has or could be reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on performance of duties to the Company or on the business or reputation of the Company; (ii) being the subject of any order regarding a fraudulent violation of securities laws;  (iii) conduct in connection with employment or service that is not taken in good faith and has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in material injury to the business or reputation of the Company; (iv) willful violation of  the Company's Code of Ethical Business Conduct or other material policies; (v) willful neglect in the performance of duties, or willful or repeated failure or refusal to perform these duties; or (vi) material breach of any applicable  employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Good Reason" means with respect to any executive (i) a material diminution in base salary; (ii) a  material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iii) relocation of the executive's principal place of employment more than 50 miles from the location  immediately prior to the Change in Control; or (iv) any other action or inaction that is a material breach by the Company of any agreement under which the executive provides services to us.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Severance Plan. The Executive Severance Plan provides for severance benefits in the event of a Qualifying Separation of an Eligible Executive's employment. Pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan, an Eligible Executive who incurs a Qualifying Separation would be entitled to receive severance payments during the applicable severance period, unless and until the Eligible Executive is employed by another employer. The Executive Severance Plan also provides a COBRA subsidy for a period of up to 18 months following a Qualifying Separation for U.S. Executives.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Change in Control Plan. Pursuant to the Change in Control Plan, an eligible executive who incurs a Qualifying Separation would be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (a) three times base salary in the case of the CEO and two times base salary in the case of an eligible executive other than the CEO; and (b) in the case of the CEO, three times the higher of the CEO's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, or in the case of an eligible executive other than the CEO, two times the higher of the eligible executive's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. In addition, an eligible executive who incurs a Qualifying Separation is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment representing the sum of 36 monthly COBRA premiums for the CEO and 24 monthly COBRA premiums for eligible executives other than the CEO. 
Annual Incentive Plan. In the event of a Change in Control, each executive's annual incentive target award will be prorated for the time period between the plan start date and the effective change in control date. A payment will also be calculated for that time period based on actual performance and compared to the prorated target, with the executive receiving the larger of the two values. Payment of the award will be made by March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which a change in control occurs. 
If involuntarily terminated without Cause, each executive, including the NEOs, will also be eligible for a prorated portion of his or her annual incentive award. The period used to determine the prorated award will be the beginning of the performance period to the individual's termination date. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan. An equity award must be outstanding for one year in order to receive any benefit at termination. Upon a termination without Cause, for Good Reason or due to death or disability, the time-based RSUs will be prorated over the period between the grant date and termination date. Any unvested pro-rata awards will be delivered at the next scheduled vesting date. 
Upon a termination without Cause, for Good Reason or due to retirement, death or disability, any outstanding performance-based RSUs will be prorated over the period between the grant date and termination date. The final performance payout will be determined at the end of the performance period and shares will be distributed at the time of the general distribution. 
If an executive voluntarily departs (with the exception of the retirement provisions discussed above) or is terminated for Cause, or in the event of any termination prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, all outstanding unvested equity awards will be canceled. 
Upon a Qualifying Separation within two years after a Change in Control, or upon a Change in Control if a replacement award is not provided, outstanding unvested equity awards will vest as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-based RSUs will vest in full; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After a determination by the Compensation Committee of the Company's performance at the time of the Change in  Control, the number of performance-based RSUs that will vest will be equal to the greater of (a) the performance-based RSUs earned through the change in control date, or (b) 100% of the performance-based RSUs granted.   
[END TABLE]
A replacement award is an award with respect to the stock of Delphi Technologies or its successor that is at least equal in value to the outstanding award, is a publicly traded security and has no less favorable terms than the outstanding award. A qualifying termination after a change in control includes any termination by the Company without cause, or by the NEO for good reason, or due to death or disability.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
The following table describes the payments each NEO (other than Mr. Butterworth whose employment terminated pursuant to his voluntary resignation in October 2018 and other than Mr. Nair, who did not receive any severance or other termination benefits in connection with the termination of his Employment Agreement in January 2019) would have earned on December 31, 2018, subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee, had his or her employment terminated on such date under various scenarios, including a Qualifying Separation of employment after a Change in Control of the Company.

All amounts are estimates only, and actual amounts will vary depending upon the facts and circumstances applicable at the time of the triggering event.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee consists of Mr. Cantie, Chair, Mr. Adams and Ms. Connors. All of the members of the Audit Committee meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and the additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules. The Board has determined that each of Mr. Cantie and Mr. Adams qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules of the SEC. 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is evaluated annually. The charter is available on the Company's website at delphi.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Primary Responsibilities 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, the performance of the Company's independent auditor and internal audit function, and the Company's code of business conduct and ethics. 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to hire, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the Company's independent auditor. In addition, in its capacity as a committee of the Board, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the independent auditor. Furthermore, in connection with the mandated rotation of the independent auditor's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee is directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner. 
Required Disclosures and Discussions 
The Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as our independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also discussed with EY those matters required to be discussed by EY with the Audit Committee under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"). The Committee also received the written disclosures and letter from EY required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding EY's communications with the Committee concerning independence. In addition, the Committee discussed EY's independence with EY. 
The Audit Committee also considered with EY whether the provision of non-audit services provided by EY to the Company during 2018 was compatible with EY's independence and concluded that such non-audit services did not affect EY's independence. The Committee concluded that EY was independent from the Company and management. 
Roles and Responsibilities 
In its oversight role, the Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for preparing the financial statements and other reports, and of the independent auditor, which is responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and has met and held discussions with management and EY. Management  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and EY and the Audit Committee's review of the representation of management and the report of EY to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC. 
Respectfully submitted,

The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM'S FEES 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of services provided by the independent auditor. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit services, engagement fees and terms and all permitted non-audit engagements, except as otherwise prohibited pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Chair of the Audit Committee is authorized to grant such pre-approvals in the event there is a need for such approvals prior to the next full Audit Committee meeting, provided all such pre-approvals are then reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. These services are actively monitored by the Committee to maintain the appropriate objectivity and independence in Ernst & Young LLP's ("EY") core work, which is the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal controls. 
The following table represents fees paid to EY for audit, audit-related, tax and other professional services. Prior to the separation of the Company from Aptiv in December 2017, Aptiv paid all audit, audit-related, tax and other fees of EY. As a result, the amounts reported for 2017 are not directly comparable with the fees the Company paid as a stand-alone Company in 2018 or the fees the Company would expect to pay its auditors and their related affiliates in future years.

 APPOINTMENT OF AND PAYMENT TO AUDITORS (PROPOSAL 11) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to reappoint Ernst &  Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, as the Company's auditors for the period ending with the Annual Meeting of the Company to be held in 2020 and to authorize the directors to determine the fees to be paid to the auditors.   Shareholders will also be asked to ratify the appointment of  Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's auditors for purposes of U.S. securities law reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of our Board has appointed EY as our auditors. As part of its annual evaluation of the independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EY's historical and recent performance on the Company's audit;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EY's global capabilities, technical expertise, and knowledge of the Company's global operations and industry;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• External data on audit quality and performance, including PCAOB reports on EY and its peer firms; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The appropriateness of EY's fees for audit and non-audit services, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its  peer firms.  
[END TABLE]
Based on its evaluation, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that retaining Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
A representative of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if the firm desires and to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the re-appointment of EY as our auditors, to ratify their appointment as our independent registered public accounting firm and to authorize the directors to determine the fees to be paid to the auditors.  ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 12) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve, on a non-binding  advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Compensation Committee") intends to consider the outcome of the say-on-pay vote and  other shareholder feedback when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. 
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. This annual vote is consistent with the overwhelming shareholder approval at the 2018 Annual meeting of the Board's recommendation that an advisory, non-binding vote on executive compensation occur each year. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to align executive and shareholder interests by reinforcing the long-term growth, value creation and sustainability of Delphi Technologies and to ensure that the majority of compensation opportunities are a result of pay-for-performance. 
The Company is presenting Resolution 12, which gives shareholders the opportunity to approve or not approve our compensation program for NEOs by voting for or against the following resolution (a "say-on-pay" vote). While the vote on the resolution is advisory in nature and therefore will not bind us to take any particular action, the Board and Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the shareholder vote resulting from the proposal in making future decisions regarding the Company's compensation programs. 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and narrative discussion." 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, on an advisory, non-binding basis.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS

 RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Board has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy. Pursuant to this policy, the Company's executive officers, directors and nominees for directors must promptly disclose any actual or potential material conflict of interest to our General Counsel, who will then assess and communicate the information to the Nominating and Governance Committee for evaluation and appropriate resolution. The Nominating and Governance Committee will generally not approve or ratify a related party transaction unless it has determined that, upon consideration of all relevant information, the related party transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If we become aware of an existing related party transaction that has not been pre-approved under our Related Party Transaction Policy, the transaction will be referred to the Nominating and Governance Committee, which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. 
Mr. Chris Gustanski, the brother of Ms. Gustanski, an executive officer of the Company, is employed by the Company but is not an executive officer of the Company. His compensation was established by the Company in accordance with its compensation practices applicable to employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions and without the involvement of Ms. Gustanski.

Presentation of Accounts 
Under Jersey law, the directors are required to present the accounts of the Company and the reports of the auditors before shareholders at a general meeting. Therefore, the accounts of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 will be presented to the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. 
Other Business 
We do not know of any other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting, except those set forth in this Proxy Statement. If other business is properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted by the persons named therein in accordance with their judgment on such matters.

Quorum

Voting Prior to the Annual Meeting 
If your shares are owned directly in your name in an account with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, you are considered the "shareholder of record" of those shares in your account. If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by proxy in any of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet or Telephone - If you have Internet or telephone access, you may submit your proxy by following the  voting instructions in the materials you receive. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you should not return your proxy card. If you vote over the Internet or by telephone, your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on  April 23, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail - You may vote by mail by completing, dating and signing your proxy card and mailing it in the envelope  provided. You must sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as officer of a corporation, guardian, executor, trustee or custodian), you must indicate your name and title or  capacity.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." 
As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct the broker, bank, or other nominee on how to vote the shares in your account. In order for your shares to be voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee by the deadline provided in the proxy materials you receive from your broker, bank, or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted on your behalf depends on the type of item being considered for vote. Under NYSE rules, brokers are permitted to exercise discretionary voting authority only on "routine" matters. Therefore, your broker may vote on Proposal 11 ("Appointment of and Payment to Auditors") even if you do not provide voting instructions, because it is considered a routine matter. 
Your broker is not permitted to vote on the other Agenda Items if you do not provide voting instructions because those items involve matters that are considered non-routine. 
Attending the Annual Meeting 
Only shareholders and authorized guests of the Company may attend the Annual Meeting, and all attendees will be required to show a valid form of ID (such as a government-issued form of photo identification). You must also provide proof of share ownership as of the record date, such as a recent brokerage statement or letter from your bank or broker.
