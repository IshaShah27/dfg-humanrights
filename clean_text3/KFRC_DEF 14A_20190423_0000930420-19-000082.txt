LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
At Kforce, we believe the selection, development and retention of Great People leads to Great Results for our clients, consultants, employees and you, our shareholders.
2018 marked a year of focus, execution and progression for our Firm and this year's Proxy Statement reflects our commitment toward building long-term, sustainable performance, transparent corporate governance and regular communication with our shareholders.
OUR COMPANY
We realize the power of a meaningful occupation and take pride in the work of our Great People. In 2018, our associates worked diligently to provide opportunities for over 34,000 highly skilled professionals with clients of all sizes, including 70% of the Fortune 100.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
While we focus on Great Results, a key aspect of our success is our commitment to corporate culture, exemplified by our core values of stewardship and community, respect, integrity, trust, and exceptional service. These values promote a sense of greater purpose and drive our commitment to our employees, our clients, and our communities. In 2018, Kforce and its employees supported numerous charities throughout the year, with a focus on organizations that provide education, human services and community development for those in need. In November, we held our annual Day of Giving, an impactful day where 1,600 employees nationwide volunteered over 5,400 hours at 70 different events in their local communities.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our commitment to shareholder engagement is grounded in open, effective and transparent communication. This year we have continued our efforts to simplify and improve the readability of our Proxy Statement. We encourage you to learn more about our governance and compensation practices by reading this Proxy Statement and visiting the Investor Relations page on our website at www.kforce.com. 
During 2018, we also conducted our annual shareholder outreach effort and spent time engaging with shareholders on a variety of topics. The feedback and perspective we received from our shareholders has and will continue to inform our corporate governance and executive compensation practices and strategies. We believe our programs create the proper incentives and rewards for executive officers while creating long-term value for our shareholders and expect our continued board refreshment and succession planning activities will promote a balanced mix of perspective and experience within our Board of Directors. We thank all of those who participated and remain open to and invite your feedback during 2019.
We thank you for your ownership and support of Kforce and for allowing us the privilege of serving you.

PROPOSAL 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
NOMINEES
The Nomination Committee has recommended, and our Board has approved, each of Randall A. Mehl, Elaine D. Rosen and Ralph E. Struzziero as nominees for election as Class I directors at the Annual Meeting. If elected, the Class I directors will serve until our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each of the nominees is currently a director of the Firm. For information concerning the nominees, please see the section titled "Biographical Information for our Director Nominees."
Each of the nominees is willing and able to stand for election at the Annual Meeting, and we do not know of any reason why any of the nominees would be unable to serve as a director. If any nominee becomes unable or unwilling to stand for election, the Board may reduce its size or designate a substitute. If a substitute is designated, proxies voting for the original nominee will be cast for the substituted nominee.
VOTE REQUIRED
We use a majority voting standard for uncontested elections. The election of directors at this year's Annual Meeting is an uncontested election and thus the majority voting standard applies.
To be elected, the votes "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes actually cast with respect to the director's election. Votes actually cast include votes where the authority to cast a vote for the director's election is explicitly withheld and excludes abstentions and broker non-votes.

At each regular Board meeting, various operational, strategic, financial and legal compliance areas, trends, progress and risks are reviewed by the Board, in conjunction with management, through management reports and dialogue with executive leadership on different areas of the business. 
Materials and updates provided regularly to the Board are set forth below.

COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY
Our Board exhibits a wide range of backgrounds, skills, attributes and experiences. Our directors have served in leadership and management positions across fields such as banking, executive compensation, healthcare, investment banking, strategic advisory, insurance, government, military and staffing. These fields enable valuable oversight of our business and promote a broad understanding of the markets, products and industries of our client base. Four of our directors qualify as audit committee financial experts, bringing important points of view and skills to the Board. The Nomination Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board and its committees to ensure a well-functioning mix of diverse backgrounds and expertise. 
The Nomination Committee strives to identify directors who will: (1) bring to the Board a variety of skills and backgrounds; (2) bring substantial senior management experience, financial expertise and other skills that would enhance the Board's effectiveness; and (3) represent the balanced, best interests of our shareholders as a whole and the interests of our stakeholders, as appropriate, rather than special interest groups or constituencies. In selecting individual nominees, the Nomination Committee assesses independence, character and integrity, potential conflicts of interest, experience, diversity of background and the willingness to devote sufficient time to carrying out the responsibilities of a director. While the Board has not adopted a formal policy on diversity, the Nomination Committee is committed to considering diversity during the director nomination process with the goal of creating a Board that best serves the Company and the interests of its shareholders.
9 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
The Nomination Committee has established a detailed director recruitment process by which it, the entire Board, the Firm's independent directors and key management personnel all play a role in the identification, review, screening and interviewing of director candidates. The Committee's procedures for identifying and selecting director candidates are designed to ensure each candidate is evaluated for their qualifications, independence, potential conflicts and other issues of import to the Firm and Board composition. When identifying candidates, the Nomination Committee takes into account overall board composition. The priorities for recruiting new directors are based on the Firm's strategic needs and the skills composition of the Board at any given time.
The Committee also understands the importance of Board refreshment and is committed to the process in a manner that promotes a balance of perspective, experience and continuity. Since 2014, we have advanced the refreshment and diversity of our Board through the addition of three new board members.
LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Our current leadership structure includes Mr. Dunkel's service as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Firm. This role is coupled with, and balanced by, a lead independent director as well as independent Audit, Compensation, Nomination, and Corporate Governance committees and a majority of independent directors. The Board believes that this structure has served our shareholders well historically and continues to provide the most effective, efficient and appropriate framework for board oversight and governance.
Mr. Dunkel has served as Kforce's Chairman, CEO and a director since the Firm's incorporation in 1994 and as a result he possesses a deep and unique understanding of the Firm's business and operations. The Board believes that this experience, coupled with his extensive knowledge of the staffing industry, provides strong, consistent leadership and allows him to serve as a highly effective bridge between the Board and management. In addition, in his capacity as CEO, Mr. Dunkel frequently meets with shareholders, clients and other Firm stakeholders to communicate our business and strategy and understands their various perspectives and insights, which he is then able to relay to the full Board for consideration and assessment. Mr. Dunkel's beneficial ownership of approximately 4% of Kforce's outstanding common stock further aligns his interests with those of our shareholders and the Board continues to believe that his in-depth knowledge and experience places him in the best position to both guide and implement the Board's direction.  
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines recognize the importance of a lead independent director in the absence of an independent Chairman and sets forth specific roles and responsibilities of the lead independent director, including: presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors; serving as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and CEO; and having oversight of CEO hiring and succession. In addition, the chairs and all members of the Board's Audit, Compensation, Nomination, and Corporate Governance Committees are independent directors. As a result, the oversight of the critical issues within the purview of these committees is entrusted to the independent directors and serves to further uphold effective governance standards. 
The Board remains open to, and regularly seeks, shareholder feedback with regard to governance topics such as its leadership structure and considers the feedback provided as part of its assessment process.
COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS
Our Board has established five standing committees consisting of an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nomination Committee, Corporate Governance Committee and Executive Committee. These committees facilitate a more in-depth assessment of certain important areas than can be addressed during a full Board meeting. The Board has determined that the chair and each of the committee members of its Audit, Compensation, Nomination, and Corporate Governance Committees are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ and SEC Rules. The committee members and independent directors meet regularly in executive session without management. Additional information regarding the composition and responsibilities of the committees is described below. Each Committee has the authority to retain or obtain the advice of legal counsel, accountants, and other advisors. Written charters of each committee are available at http://investor.kforce.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.

RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board, as a whole and at the committee level, has an active role in overseeing the management of the Firm's risks. The Board's primary mechanism for assessing overall risk to the Firm as well as management's actions to address and mitigate those risks is a comprehensive, integrated ERM program. The Firm's ERM program divides risk into four categories: financial/strategic risk, client risk, operational risk and employment/legal risk. The ERM risk assessment process is led by Kforce's Vice President of Risk and Compliance and coordinated by the compliance team, which, together with business unit leadership, delivers regular risk assessment reports to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews these reports with members of management as part of the process.
The Board exercises an oversight role with respect to risks facing our Firm and has designated the Audit Committee with the primary responsibility for overseeing the Firm's ERM program. The Audit Committee dedicates a portion of its meetings to reviewing and discussing specific areas of risk, focusing on high risk topics in greater detail. In particular, it engages in periodic reviews of how cybersecurity risk is assessed and mitigated by the company. These reviews include discussions with third party experts that have been engaged by management to perform various cybersecurity testing and assessments. The Audit Committee provides the Board with periodic reports on the Firm's risks and ERM program findings, including cybersecurity risk and incident issues. In addition, the Firm's internal audit function, which reports to the Audit Committee, sets forth a comprehensive internal audit plan that is approved by the Audit Committee on an annual basis. This plan is formulated based on internal audit's assessment of risks within Kforce, which is primarily based on financial asset protection and reporting, data security, and other ERM program findings, discussions with Kforce's officers, directors and other key personnel, and the results of their previous operational and financial audits. 
The individual committees also consider risk within their areas of responsibility as summarized below. The committee chairs provide reports of their activities to the Board at each regular Board meeting including apprising the Board of any significant risks within their areas of responsibility and management's response to those risks.

CODE OF ETHICS AND GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
The Board has adopted a Commitment to Integrity, which is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of Kforce, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. It is intended to help Firm personnel recognize and deal with ethical issues, deter wrongdoing and provide mechanisms to report dishonest or unethical conduct. The Firm also has a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines that sets forth the Firm's corporate governance policies and practices and serves to guide the operation and direction of the Board. These guidelines, together with the charters for the standing committees of the Board and the Commitment to Integrity, are available at http://investor.kforce.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions that Kforce is required to disclose in accordance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K. The Board believes that the Audit Committee's practices and processes around the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related persons provides adequate evaluations of all potential related party transactions, including considerations on whether the transaction is on terms that are in the best interests of Kforce and our shareholders. The following related party transactions have been reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.

Mr. Struzziero's son had no involvement in management decisions of Kforce.

[END TABLE]
During 2018, Kforce:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attained 99.9% of our target revenue and 109% of our target diluted earnings per share (EPS). 
• Attained above target performance for our long-term incentive (LTI) metric; Kforce's relative total shareholder return (TSR) over the past three years (January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018) of 31% ranked 2nd versus our industry peer group of 7 direct competitors, and attained a 50th percentile ranking versus our separately designated peer group. 
• Continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives including implementing new and upgrading existing technologies, improving our alignment of revenue-generating talent, and executing a Kforce brand refresh. 
[END TABLE]
As a result of our overall financial and TSR performances, our Committee approved:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Above target annual incentive payouts, based on the performance against our financial metrics (payouts were slightly below target for revenue and above target for EPS) and on individual performance objectives (payouts were above target). 
• LTI payouts for the CEO and the President at target based on median relative TSR performance versus our separately designated peer group, and LTI payouts for the other NEOs above target based on above median relative TSR performance versus our industry peer group.

Our Executive Compensation Philosophy and Practices
Our executive compensation philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives who are able to maximize shareholder value. To carry out this philosophy, we have embraced the following principles intended to guide compensation design and administrative decisions made by the Committee, the Board and management.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Attract and Retain Key Executives   Attracting and retaining key executive talent is critical to the success of a staffing firm in which people represent the true "assets" of such a company. The Committee believes an understanding of competitive market pay levels is essential to hiring and retaining qualified executives able to drive our long-term profitable growth and long-term shareholder value. The Committee further believes it is important to be knowledgeable concerning best practices and how comparable organizations compensate their executives. 
Target Annual NEO Compensation at Market Median   The executive compensation plan is designed to target the total pay level for our NEOs at the median of comparable companies. To effectively accomplish this, the Committee annually reviews compensation data from several independent sources. Our competitive market for executive talent is primarily staffing organizations; however, the Committee also reviews pay data for other professional service and consulting organizations of comparable size and similar business models. 
Provide Pay-for-Performance by Paying Higher Compensation for Above Median Performance and Lower Compensation for Below Median Performance   The Committee believes executive compensation should align with our revenue, profit and TSR performance and provide superior cash and equity compensation opportunities for superior performance. The Committee also believes the design of our compensation programs provides incentives for our NEOs to exceed targeted performance, which results in significant relative shareholder value creation and creates a positive perception of Kforce in the highly competitive market for executive talent. Accordingly, the opposite is true for below median performance resulting in lower compensation. 
Ensure Performance-Based Compensation is the Largest Part of Total Compensation   The Committee designs the compensation framework with significant emphasis on performance-based compensation over fixed compensation to motivate our NEOs to drive operational performance without encouraging unreasonable risk. Performance-based compensation at target comprised 73% of target total direct compensation for our CEO and between 64% to 73% for our other NEOs in 2018. 
Ensure Equity-Based LTI Compensation is a Significant Component of Performance-Based Compensation   The Committee believes equity-based LTI compensation should be a significant component of performance-based compensation to further focus executive efforts on long-term shareholder returns. Target equity LTI ranged from 60% to 67% of target total performance-based compensation for our NEOs in 2018. We believe the opportunity to earn the designated equity LTI performance objectives motivates the achievement of higher relative TSR; it also serves to retain our executives for the long-term, given the denomination of earned equity LTIs as time-based restricted stock. 
Require Share Ownership   The Committee believes our executives should have a personal financial stake in Kforce's ongoing future success, primarily driven by a desire to match their interests with those of our shareholders. In addition to equity-based LTIs playing a significant role in our executive compensation program, all employees, including the NEOs, are eligible to purchase stock through the Kforce Inc. 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. To further align the interests of executives and long-term shareholders, our Board has adopted formal ownership guidelines, set forth below.

To further align the interests of executives and long-term shareholders, our Board has adopted formal ownership guidelines, set forth below.
Consider Tax Deductibility in Compensation Plan Design   The Committee considers all possible tax consequences in the design of our executive compensation programs. Our NEO compensation framework was structured so that our performance-based annual incentive and LTI awards would be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) resulted in the elimination of performance-based compensation exemptions, except with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements granted prior to November 2, 2017. As a result, this has limited the tax deductibility of NEO compensation beginning in 2018. Although the use of the Kforce Inc. Amended and Restated Performance Incentive Plan previously approved by our shareholders was not historically the exclusive method of making annual incentives, its use has been discontinued as a result of the elimination of the compensation exemptions. Despite the changes to Section 162(m), we expect the structure of our NEO compensation program will continue to include a significant portion of performance-based compensation, which is consistent with our compensation philosophy of linking pay to performance and aligning executive interests with those of our shareholders.

Set Challenging Performance Objectives   We work to set difficult but attainable financial growth performance objectives for our NEOs in the context of the annual incentive plan as evidenced by the fact that threshold and target goals and objectives have not been met in every plan year.

The Company's compensation program has the following features for alignment with best practices:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Minimum Required Share Ownership Guidelines   Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include a stock ownership policy for our directors and executives. The minimum level of holdings for each position is as follows: 
      Target Holding Level (Lesser Of) 
    Position   Annual Retainer / Salary OR Shares 
    Director   3x   5,000 
    Chief Executive Officer   5x   200,000 
    President   3x   100,000 
    Chief Financial Officer   2x   50,000 
    Chief Operations Officer   2x   30,000 
    Other members of Kforce's Executive Leadership Team   0.5x   10,000 
    As of the Record Date, all directors, NEOs and other members of our executive leadership were in compliance with the policy. In accordance with the policy, directors have three years from the effective date of joining the Board, and executives have two years from the effective date of a promotion or salary increase, to attain the ownership level. 
Clawback Policy   Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include a clawback policy applicable to all executive officers. Accordingly, in the event of a restatement of our financial statements because of a material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, the Board will, if determined appropriate, recover from current executives any incentive-based compensation paid for any applicable performance periods beginning after March 30, 2012. 
Equity Plan Features   The Committee believes Kforce's equity plans are structured to avoid problematic pay practices and features that could be detrimental to shareholder interests. None of our Stock Incentive Plans (as approved by shareholders in 2013, 2016 and 2017 and pending approval of Proposal 4 in 2019) permit repricing or cash buyouts of underwater options or stock appreciation rights without shareholder approval. The 2017 and 2019 Plans require a minimum vesting period of one year on all award types. In addition, the 2019 Plan requires a minimum holding period of one year after exercise of any options and stock appreciation rights for all NEOs; we will also apply this policy to any awards granted outside of this plan.

Insider Trading, Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging   Our Insider Trading Policy governs the trading in our securities by directors, officers and employees and other persons who have or may have access to material, nonpublic information. The policy has the following restrictions:  
    s No trading while in the possession of material, nonpublic information s No trading during designated black-out periods s No trading without pre-approval (certain insiders) 
    s No margin accounts s No pledging s No hedging (including, but not limited to, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds)  
    s No trading in any interest or position relating to future stock price, such as a puts, calls or short sales 
Elimination of Excise Tax Gross-Up   In 2009, the Committee resolved to not enter into any new employment agreements, or materially amend any existing employment agreements with its executives that contain excise tax gross-up provisions in the event of a change-in-control event going forward. Since the Committee's resolution, all new or amended executive employment agreements have excluded excise tax gross-up provisions. As a result, the only remaining employment agreements which continue to include excise tax gross-up provisions are with Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore; both of these agreements were most recently amended in 2008.

It is also responsible for reviewing and approving Kforce's overall compensation, inclusive of employee benefit policies and practices. The Committee has concluded the compensation policies and practices of the Firm do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Kforce.

Overall, the independent compensation consultant assists with various items, including evaluating and providing guidance with respect to: compliance with the approved compensation framework and alignment with performance; effectiveness of the compensation framework; and competitiveness of our executive compensation (including salary and annual and long-term incentives) as compared to the market.
The Committee has retained Pay Governance LLC, a national independent consulting firm, to serve as the Committee's  compensation consultant. The Committee assessed Pay Governance's independence based on various factors and determined Pay Governance's engagement, and the anticipated services to be provided to the Committee, did not raise any conflicts of interest. Except for the services provided to the Committee, Pay Governance did not provide any other services to the Firm.
Peer Groups and Benchmarking
Kforce historically used two distinct peer groups for the purposes of assessing and determining its executive compensation structure: (1) an industry peer group and (2) a separately designated peer group. The Committee has used both peer groups as a source for executive compensation benchmarking data and comparisons to Kforce's executive compensation levels; for further insight into external compensation practices; and for determining specific financial growth objectives for our performance-based compensation. 
While the use of multiple peer groups may appear atypical, we believe the two peer groups as described below have historically supported a strong executive compensation program. However, to simplify the program in the future, the Committee approved a prospective structural change, as described in the "2019 NEO Compensation Plan Changes" section below.
Industry Peer Group
In determining the industry peer group, we focus on selecting publicly-traded professional staffing companies active in recruiting and placing similar skill sets at similar types of clients. The specialty staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies, most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base. A report published by Staffing Industry Analysts in 2018 indicated that Kforce is one of the 10 largest publicly-traded specialty staffing firms in the U.S. In addition to the specific staffing industry in which we operate, other primary criteria for this peer group selection includes customers, revenue footprint (i.e., revenue derived from different industries as a percentage of total revenue), geographical presence, talent, domestic presence, complexity of operating model and companies with which we compete for executive level talent. Most importantly, we consider the companies in the industry peer group as our direct business competitors on a day-to-day basis and, as a result, their size and scope vary considerably.
In addition to using this peer group for the reasons noted above, the industry peer group is specifically used in relative TSR performance-based objectives to determine LTI compensation. The industry peer group is also considered in more depth and has a greater impact on the annual incentive performance growth objective target settings than the separately designated peer group, due to the closer relationship to our industry and our desire to set such incentive performance growth objectives at or higher than industry expectations.
The 2018 Industry Peer Group (which was unchanged from 2017) consisted of the following companies:

Separately Designated Peer Group
The separately designated peer group is based on a broader set of peers, which are more similar in terms of size (revenue and market capitalization) but may not be in the staffing industry. The primary objective for peer selection in this group is to benchmark the composition of compensation and total compensation levels relative to performance. We believe this is consistent with how potential investors and institutional shareholder advisory firms consider appropriate peer groups, which consist of similar industry classification codes, revenue and market capitalizations.
In addition to using this peer group for the reasons noted above, the separately designated peer group is specifically used as a part of the relative TSR performance-based objectives to determine the ultimate payout for the LTI compensation for the CEO and the President.

Consideration of Shareholder Feedback
We believe shareholder feedback helps to strengthen our governance practices and compensation framework. The feedback from both our annual shareholder outreach program, as well as the results of our advisory votes on executive compensation, enhances our understanding of our shareholders' concerns and areas of focus. We remain committed to open and transparent communication and engagement with our shareholders and take feedback into consideration. Our shareholders are invited to communicate with our directors either individually or as a group by writing to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at Kforce Inc., 1001 East Palm Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33605. Such communications will be delivered directly to Kforce's Board.
As an ongoing annual practice, we reach out to our top 25 institutional shareholders (representing more than half of our shares outstanding) to solicit feedback on various topics, including corporate governance practices, Board composition and refreshment and executive compensation, among others. During our 2019 Proxy season outreach, we offered a conversation with management and with the Compensation Committee Chair and/or other members of the Committee or Board. A few of our top shareholders did request a meeting with management, and management shared the results of those conversations with the Board for consideration. Based on this engagement, there were no negative comments or suggestions for changes to our NEO compensation programs.
Over the past several years, our "say on pay" proposal has received substantial support from our shareholders. The following shows the percentage of votes (excluding brokers non-votes) cast "for" the advisory vote to approve executive compensation:
The Compensation Committee believes the 2018 voting results reflect our shareholders' support of our overall NEO compensation framework and indicates approval of executive compensation paid in the context of our performance results.

2018 NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
Financial and Operational Summary
In 2018, we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Implementing new and upgrading existing technologies that we believe will allow us to more effectively and efficiently serve our clients, consultants and candidates and improve the scalability of our organization. We completed the deployment of a new time and expense application for our consultants and clients as well as a new expense application for our associates. In addition, we continue to make enhancements to our business and data intelligence capabilities as well as our customer relationship management system. We expect these initiatives to benefit us in 2019 and beyond.  
• Improving our alignment of revenue-generating talent to the markets, products, industries and clients that present the greatest opportunity for profitable revenue growth.  
• Executing a Kforce brand refresh to reinforce our core values with a consistent message and identity.  
[END TABLE]
The following presents our adjusted revenue and adjusted diluted EPS over the past three years.
*Represents non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue for 2017 and Adjusted Diluted EPS for 2017 and 2016. The calculation of these figures, and their reconciliation to the applicable GAAP figures, are set forth in Appendix B to this Proxy Statement. For 2018, there were no adjustments, so Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Diluted EPS were equal to GAAP figures as reported.
Our 2018 revenue increased 4.4% year over year, driven by our largest business, Tech Flex. Our 2018 adjusted diluted EPS grew 46.5%, primarily because of the continued improvements in our SG&A expenses as well as a lower effective tax rate resulting from the TCJA. Our income before income taxes increased 20.4% year over year. Our 2018 financial performance resulted in a revenue incentive payout slightly below target and an EPS incentive payout above target for our NEOs.
The following presents our three-year TSR performance versus our peer groups over the past two measurement periods.
Kforce's three-year TSR results in absolute terms and relative to our peer groups improved during 2018. These results generated higher LTI awards for our NEOs in 2018.

Additionally during 2018, we improved our operating cash flows to $87.7 million, from $29.3 million in 2017 and $39.8 million in 2016, which enabled us to return capital to our shareholders by completing four quarterly dividend payments ($0.12 per share during the first two quarters of the year and $0.18 during the last two quarters of the year for a total of $0.60 per share during 2018) and repurchasing 553 thousand shares under our Board-authorized common stock repurchase program. The dollar amounts of these activities are as follows:
We believe the financial and operational results as discussed above are reflected in the payouts made for 2018 to our NEOs, which are illustrated within the Earned Compensation Table and in the Summary Compensation Table below.
2018 NEO Compensation Components, Results and Determinations
The following section discusses the compensation components, results and determinations as it relates to the 2018 NEOs and reflects the 2016-2018 NEO compensation framework design. Our historical practice has been to develop a three-year NEO compensation framework. The framework for the 2016-2018 period, as approved by the Committee, targets total annual NEO compensation at the market median for market median performance. See the "2019 NEO Compensation Plan Changes" section below for proposed future changes to the development of a three-year framework.
The components of the 2016-2018 framework include salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based annual incentive compensation is primarily measured on revenue and EPS growth targets, which we believe serve to drive shareholder returns and, to a lesser extent, on individual performance objectives. 
• LTI compensation is 100% performance-based, and is measured on Kforce's TSR performance over a three-year measurement period relative to the specified peer groups.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee emphasizes the use of variable performance-based compensation over fixed compensation to effectively motivate our NEOs to drive operational performance. The charts below show fixed compensation (equal to salary), annual incentive and LTI compensation, each as a percentage of total direct compensation (TDC) for the CEO and for the other NEOs in the aggregate for 2018. We define TDC as the amount of total compensation derived from salary, annual incentives and LTI. The charts below show the amounts for annual incentives and LTIs at target:

Annual Incentive Compensation
Annual incentive compensation for 2018 was targeted at the median of our peer groups. Actual payout levels of the annual incentive awards may be above or below target based on actual performance. In addition, our annual incentive awards require minimum performance thresholds for any payout to occur for specific performance measures and objectives. We believe the annual incentive effectively motivates our NEOs to drive operational performance without encouraging unreasonable risk. The Committee believes the attainment of year-over-year revenue and EPS growth goals will result in sustainable long-term shareholder value creation.
The annual incentive compensation for our NEOs consists of two performance-based components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. A financial metric incentive (the Financial Performance Incentive). The 2018 Financial Performance Incentive represented 80% (50% for Mr. Thomas) of the total target incentive award and required attainment of annual year-over-year revenue growth and year-over-year diluted EPS growth performance goals. 
2. An objectives-based incentive for individual accomplishments and management business objectives (the MBO Incentive). The MBO Incentive represented 20% (50% for Mr. Thomas) of the total target incentive award.

[END TABLE]
The following table provides the potential Financial Performance Incentive payout ranges as determined by the Committee, based on revenue growth and diluted EPS growth performance. The Committee determines revenue and diluted EPS growth performance ranges based on expected market conditions and expected growth rates in the staffing industry and among the companies in our peer groups. Total revenue and diluted EPS amounts and related year-over-year growth rates that fall between the noted Threshold and Maximum performance levels in the table below are interpolated. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Maximum   $1,487 9% 200%   $2.48 58% 200% 
(1) The incentive payout ranges for Mr. Thomas were modified beginning in September 2018 due to his additional responsibilities of leading the human resources, compensation and benefits organizations. For the first eight months of 2018, the interpolated payout percentages between Threshold and Target varied slightly from the last four months of 2018.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, Kforce had revenue of $1,418 million and diluted EPS of $2.30, therefore attaining 99.9% of target revenue and 109% of target diluted EPS. As a result, overall payments for the Financial Performance Incentive were above target (payouts were slightly below target for the revenue metric and above target for the EPS metric).
For purposes of the MBO Incentive, the Committee considered each individual's accomplishments based on management business objectives and overall operational performance. As with the Financial Performance Incentive goals, the Committee strives to set the individual goals at levels intended to effectively motivate superior operational performance without encouraging unreasonable risk. During 2018, our executive team's MBO metrics were focused around our strategic objectives of achieving above-market revenue growth, making prudent investments to enhance efficiency and effectiveness within our operating model and significantly improving levels of operating profitability. We have made progress on various initiatives including implementing enhanced technologies, improving the productivity of our associates, re-balancing and further diversifying our client portfolio and executing a Kforce brand refresh, as well as improving our operating cash flows. The significant progress on these strategic initiatives, as discussed above, resulted in the MBO payout percentages.

26 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
In 2018, the LTI compensation for our CEO and President was in part based on Kforce's TSR performance relative to our 2018 Separately Designated Peer Group during the measurement period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. Based on this separate performance metric, there is a potential adjustment to our CEO's and President's respective LTI awards, either by a reduction in the award value or by a supplement to their restricted stock awards with a cash LTI component. The adjustment was based on a performance multiplier determined by our TSR performance percentile ranking within the 2018 Separately Designated Peer Group. This performance metric for LTI compensation was incorporated into the compensation framework for our CEO and President to align pay to the performance of a broader set of peers that are reasonably similar in terms of size but may not be in the staffing industry.

For 2018, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore did not receive a cash LTI payout. As reflected in the performance multipliers table above, the values of Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore's respective restricted stock awards were reduced by 25% because of the 50th percentile ranking of Kforce within the Separately Designated Peer Group.
Earned Compensation Table for Corresponding Year of Performance
We believe the presentation in the SCT does not accurately reflect the actual compensation earned by the NEOs in any given year based on that year's performance. We believe the misalignment between the disclosures in the SCT and the actual earned compensation results from the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The values from pension and other compensation columns of the SCT are not performance-based and change based on factors unrelated to performance such as changes in long-term interest rates (a key factor in calculating pension values). 
• For 2016, the LTI restricted stock grants historically occurred on the first business day of each fiscal year and were based on our relative TSR performance for a measurement period ending in the prior year. As a result, the value of the awards were reflected as compensation in the SCT in the year of grant rather than in the performance year the award was earned. In order to rectify the misalignment created by our historical grant date practices and to create a more clear and transparent picture of our NEO compensation, the Committee approved a change in the timing of the grant date for the LTI restricted stock awards during 2016, which resulted in two LTI award grants in 2016, one on the first business day of the year (old method) and one on the last business day of the year (new method designed to match the performance year with the grant year). 2016 is the only year for such an occurrence and this misalignment no longer exists in 2017 and 2018. 
[END TABLE]

The following Earned Compensation for Corresponding Year of Performance Table (ECT) corrects these misalignments and provides a more appropriate measure and comparison for our shareholders. 
We believe the ECT currently provides a better illustration of the pay-for-performance measures built into our executive compensation programs. As such, we believe the following ECT should be used by our shareholders in their evaluation and vote on our executive compensation proposal (Proposal 3) within this Proxy Statement. However, due to the shift in the timing of the LTI grants as discussed above, it is our intention to remove this additional table in future years, as the SCT will eventually have the same values as the ECT below once the new method for reporting LTI grants is fully effective.

(1) Reflects the realignment of equity LTI awards to the corresponding year of performance for 2016. The equity LTI awards made on the first business day of 2016 related to 2015, which corresponds to the performance period for those awards. No adjustment was made to the 2017 and 2018 amounts; thus, these amounts are consistent with the SCT. 
(2) Total direct compensation is the sum of salary, annual incentive and LTI earned for the corresponding year of performance. 
(3) Represents non-GAAP Adjusted Revenue for 2017 and Diluted EPS for 2017 and 2016. The calculation of Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Diluted EPS, and the reconciliation to the applicable GAAP figures, for 2017 and 2016 are set forth in the Appendix B within this Proxy Statement. For 2018, there were no adjustments and balances noted above are reported in accordance with GAAP.

CEO Pay Ratio
We calculated the ratio of our CEO's total annual compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees under applicable SEC rules, using a reasonable estimate. As of December 31, 2018, Kforce employed approximately 2,400 associates and 11,400 consultants on assignment providing flexible staffing services and solutions to our clients. Approximately 92% of the consultants are employed directly by Kforce; the other 8% consists of qualified independent contractors. In order to determine our median employee, we compiled a list of all employees from our payroll records including all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees who were employed as of December 31, 2018, which included our consultants that were directly employed by Kforce as of that date but did not include the independent contractors. We examined all wages as reportable on Form W-2 for 2018 for these individuals, excluding our CEO. We annualized the compensation for any full-time and part-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. However, it is important to note that our consultants work on temporary assignments of different types and durations, and since these employees are considered temporary, we did not annualize their compensation; therefore, our employee population included a majority of individuals that did not have a full year of compensation due to the short-term nature of their assignments.
Mr. Dunkel had $4,289,262 in total annual compensation for 2018, as reflected in the SCT included in this Proxy Statement. Our median employee, one of our consultants, had total annual compensation of $39,585 for 2018, which was calculated on the same basis as Mr. Dunkel's compensation for the purposes of the SCT. As a result, we estimate Mr. Dunkel's total compensation for 2018 was about 108 times that of our median employee. Given the different methodologies that various companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio and given the uniqueness of our temporary employee population, we do not believe that this estimated ratio should be used as a basis for comparison with other companies.

Other Compensation Practices, Policies and Information

Kforce Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan  Kforce maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which eligible management and highly compensated key employees, as defined by IRS regulations, may elect to defer all or part of their compensation to later years. Amounts deferred are indexed to investment options selected by the eligible employees and the increase or decrease in value is based upon the performance of the selected investments. Eligible employees are permitted to change investment options and scheduled distributions annually. Kforce has insured the lives of certain participants in the deferred compensation plan to assist in the funding of the deferred compensation liability. Employer matching contributions to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are discretionary and are funded annually as approved by the Board.

Employer matching contributions to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are discretionary and are funded annually as approved by the Board. 
Kforce Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan During 2006, Kforce adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for all NEOs. Of the NEOs, only Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore participate in the SERP. The Committee previously decided to not allow any additional participants into the SERP. The primary goals of the SERP are to create an additional wealth accumulation opportunity, restore lost qualified pension benefits due to government limitations and retain our covered executive officers. The SERP will be funded entirely by Kforce, and benefits are taxable to the executive officer upon receipt and deductible by Kforce when paid. Benefits payable under the SERP upon the occurrence of a qualifying distribution event, as defined, are targeted at 45% of the covered executive officers' average salary and annual incentive, as defined, from the three years in which the covered executive officer earned the highest salary and annual incentive during the last 10 years of employment, which is subject to adjustment for retirement prior to the normal retirement age and the participant's vesting percentage. Benefits under the SERP are based on the lump sum present value but may be paid over the life of the covered executive officer or 10-year annuity, as elected by the covered executive officer upon commencement of participation in the SERP. Normal retirement age under the SERP is defined as age 65. Vesting under the plan is defined as 100% upon a participant's attainment of age 55 and 10 years of service and 0% prior to a participant's attainment of age 55 and 10 years of service. Full vesting also occurs if a participant with five years or more of service is involuntarily terminated by Kforce without cause or upon death, disability or a change in control. Certain conditions allow for early retirement as early as age 55. The benefits under the SERP are reduced for a participant who has not either reached age 62 and 10 years of service or age 55 and 25 years of service with a percentage reduction up to the normal retirement age. On each anniversary of the effective date, each NEO is credited with a year of service. The NEOs were not credited with any years of service prior to December 31, 2006, the effective date of the plan. The Committee believes the SERP provides significant retention benefits for the participants.

The NEOs were not credited with any years of service prior to December 31, 2006, the effective date of the plan. The Committee believes the SERP provides significant retention benefits for the participants.
Employment, Severance and Change in Control Agreements Kforce has employment agreements with each of its NEOs, which provide for severance payments under certain termination circumstances, including termination following a change in control, as defined in the employment agreements. The Committee has determined it is in Kforce's and its shareholders' best interests to recognize the contributions of the NEOs to Kforce's business and to retain the NEOs' services. The specific amounts the NEOs would receive under the employment agreements are described in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section below. The Committee believes the employment agreements are an essential component of the executive compensation program and are helpful in attracting and retaining executive talent in a competitive market. The Committee periodically reviews the benefits provided under the employment agreements to determine that they continue to serve Kforce's interests in providing significant retention benefits to these key executives, are consistent with market practice and are reasonable. In 2009, the Committee resolved to not enter into any new employment agreements or materially amend any existing employment agreements with its executives that contain excise tax gross-up provisions going forward. At this time, only Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore have excise tax gross-up provisions in their existing employment agreements. In 2017, the Committee resolved to not enter into any new employment agreements or materially amend any existing employment agreements with its executives that contain provisions for severance payments that exceed 1x cash compensation or change in control severance payments that exceed 2x cash compensation. The amended and restated employment agreement for Mr. Thomas was effective January 1, 2013, but was publicly filed as a result of his NEO designation in 2018. Refer to Exhibit 10.21 to the Company's report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2019. There have been no amendments or modifications to his employment agreement since January 1, 2013 and he did not become party to any pre-existing arrangement as a result of becoming an NEO.

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits Kforce does not generally provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to its NEOs. During 2017, Kforce provided for Ms. Mitchell's relocation to our corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida from the Washington D.C. area; the value of this relocation is included within the "All Other Compensation" column of the SCT.

2019 NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION CHANGES
2019 NEO Compensation Plan Changes
Although our historical practice has been to develop a three-year NEO compensation framework, the Committee continually monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the NEO compensation framework relative to its stated compensation philosophies and the Firm's initiatives and makes any necessary adjustments. During 2018, the Committee reviewed the NEO compensation framework to develop the framework for the 2019-2021 period and determined the three-year structure did not provide for enough flexibility and timely restructuring of the framework based on changes in the Company's business strategies. Therefore, the Committee decided to evaluate the NEO compensation framework on an annual basis going forward. This change also allows the Committee to respond more promptly to changes in the constantly evolving executive compensation landscape to ensure that our compensation practices align with both our Firm objectives and market compensation. The following describes the NEO compensation framework structure and changes for 2019. 
The 2019 framework continues to target total annual NEO compensation at the market median and emphasizes the use of variable performance-based compensation over fixed compensation to effectively motivate our NEOs to drive operational performance. The primary components of the structure continue to include salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI compensation. In addition to the MBO Incentive related to progressing our operational and strategic objectives as a component of the annual incentive compensation for 2019, the Committee has also provided for an additional one-time cash MBO bonus potential for Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore, which is based upon the successful completion of a transaction to sell our federal government solutions business.
The most notable changes in the NEO compensation plan structure for 2019 include: (1) creating a single peer group (2019 Peer Group) rather than relying on two distinct peer groups; and (2) eliminating the separate LTI compensation performance metric for the CEO and the President, which was formerly based on Kforce's relative TSR performance versus the Separately Designated Peer Group.
2019 Peer Group
The peer group for 2019 will include the following companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. Resources Connection, Inc. 
ASGN Incorporated Huron Consulting Group Inc. Robert Half International Inc. 
Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. Kelly Services, Inc. TrueBlue, Inc. 
Computer Task Group, Incorporated Korn/Ferry International Volt Information Sciences, Inc. 
The Hackett Group, Inc. Manpower Group Inc.   
[END TABLE]
Most of the companies listed in the 2019 Peer Group above are from the prior Industry and Separately Designated Peer Groups, plus appropriate new companies. All companies were chosen based on similarity to Kforce in staffing industry business models, as well as their current revenue and market capitalization. The new peer group includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All seven companies from the prior Industry Peer Group, which reflect prominence in the staffing industry; 
• Four companies from the prior Separately Designated Peer Group, which are all of comparable size to Kforce and with similar business models to Kforce, including Korn/Ferry International, Volt Information Sciences, Inc., Huron Consulting Group Inc., and Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc.; and 
• Three new companies, which are also of comparable size and business model, including AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., Cross Country Healthcare, Inc., and The Hackett Group, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
The 2019 Peer Group had the following financial statistics for 2018 (in thousands, except percentile rank): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Revenue   Market Capitalization 
25th Percentile   $ 776,070     $ 474,930   
Median   $ 1,418,353     $ 821,248   
75th Percentile   $ 2,949,494     $ 2,441,862   
Kforce Inc.   $ 1,418,353     $ 804,971   
Percentile Rank   50     42   
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives
The previous compensation framework included a component that could result in a potential reduction to our CEO's and President's respective LTI restricted stock awards, or a supplement to their restricted stock awards with a cash LTI component. This component was determined by a performance multiplier that was based on a three-year TSR performance metric versus a separately designated peer group. With the elimination of the separately designated peer group, this performance metric and potential for adjustments to LTI awards for our CEO and President have also been eliminated. The Committee has structured the new 2019 LTI payout chart based on the 2019 Peer Group shown above and provided for an appropriate leverage to provide higher compensation for above median performance and lower compensation for below median performance.

(1) These amounts represent the estimated payouts under the 2018 annual incentive compensation plan. The threshold, as defined in Item 402(d) of Regulation S-K, represents the minimum amount payable upon attaining minimum performance thresholds established by the Committee each year. If the minimum performance thresholds are not attained, there would be no payout. The maximum payout is 200% of the target multiplier for all components of the 2018 annual incentive compensation plan. Actual payments for annual incentive compensation earned during 2018 are listed in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the SCT. 
(2) The equity LTI awards granted in the form of restricted stock under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan on December 31, 2018 have a four-year vesting period with 25% of the award vesting annually, except for Mr. Dunkel's award which has a three-year vesting period with 33% of the award vesting annually. Restricted stock awards contain the right to forfeitable dividends in the form of additional shares of restricted stock at the same rate as the cash dividend on common stock and containing the same vesting provisions as the underlying award. The fair market value of restricted stock is determined based on the closing stock price of Kforce's common stock at the date of grant. The stock price and grant date fair value for the December 31, 2018 awards was $30.92. The grant date fair value of the awards is included within the amounts presented in the "Stock Awards" column of the SCT. 
(3) As a result of attaining the 50th percentile ranking for the relative TSR performance versus the 2018 Separately Designated Peer Group, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore did not receive LTI cash bonuses and had their equity LTI grant amounts reduced by 25%.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
This section describes amounts that would have been payable to the NEOs for various service termination or change in control (CIC) scenarios on December 31, 2018. In 2009, the Committee resolved to not enter into any new employment agreements or materially amend any existing employment agreements with its executives that contain excise tax gross-up provisions going forward. In 2017, the Committee resolved to not enter into any new employment agreements or materially amend any existing employment agreements with its executives that contain provisions for severance payments that exceed 1x cash compensation or change in control severance payments that exceed 2x cash compensation.
The employment agreements for each NEO have been publicly filed and condition receipt of certain severance and CIC benefits on confidentiality and client and employee non-solicitation provisions, as specified in those agreements; the typical length of the non-solicitation restrictions is two years. In addition, the Firm's standard severance and release agreements include condition receipt of severance benefits on continuing to honor these restrictions; these severance agreements also include standard non-disparagement clauses.
The amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Thomas was effective January 1, 2013, but was publicly filed as a result of his NEO designation in 2018. Refer to Exhibit 10.21 to the Company's Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2019. There have been no amendments or modifications to his employment agreement since January 1, 2013 and he did not become party to any pre-existing arrangement as a result of becoming an NEO.
Employment Agreement Severance Based on Termination By Employer For Cause or By Employee Without Good Reason
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement and of the SERP, upon a termination either by the employer for cause or by the employee without good reason, the NEOs would be eligible to receive all earned and accrued salary, annual incentive, and employee benefits such as paid-time off, as of the termination date and would also have the ability to exercise, if necessary, all plan-based awards that were vested as of the termination date. Under this scenario, none of the NEOs would be eligible for a severance payment or accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards. As a result, a column for this scenario has been omitted from the table below.

Table of Contents
Employment Agreement Severance Based on Termination By Employer Without Cause or By Employee For Good Reason
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, upon a termination by the employer without cause or by the employee for good reason, the NEO would be eligible for a severance payment. For Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore, the severance is calculated using a factor (2.99 for Mr. Dunkel and 2.00 for Mr. Liberatore) and applying it to the sum of their salaries on the date of termination plus the average of their cash bonuses over a period of time (three years for Mr. Dunkel and two years for Mr. Liberatore). For Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell, the severance is calculated as the sum of their salaries on the date of termination plus (1) the average of their cash bonuses over a period of two years and (2) the lesser of the average value of any stock, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or alternative LTI over a period of two years, or $200,000.
Employment Agreement Severance Based on Termination By Employer Without Cause or By Employee For Good Reason - Following a Change in Control
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, upon a termination by the employer without cause or by the employee for good reason following a CIC, the NEO would be eligible for a severance payment, calculated differently from the scenario directly above. For Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore, the severance is calculated using a factor of 2.99 and applying it to the sum of their salaries on the date of termination plus the average of their cash bonuses and the value of any stock, restricted stock or stock options over a period of three years. For Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell, the severance is calculated using a factor of 2.00 and applying it to the sum of their salaries on the date of termination plus (1) the average of their cash bonuses over a period of two years and (2) the average value of any stock, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or alternative LTI over a period of two years. 
Each of the respective employment agreements also provides for health care benefits after a CIC for a period of one year.
Pursuant to the terms of all of the NEOs' outstanding restricted stock award agreements, the remaining unvested restricted stock would immediately vest upon a CIC.
Pursuant to the provisions of the SERP, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore are credited with up to 10 years of additional cumulative years of service upon a CIC.
Change in Control
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, there would be no severance payment subsequent to a CIC in the absence of a termination.
Pursuant to the terms of all of the NEOs' outstanding restricted stock award agreements, the remaining unvested restricted stock would immediately vest upon a CIC.
Death or Disability
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, none of the NEOs would be eligible for a severance payment upon death or disability.
Each of the respective employment agreements for our NEOs provides for a continuation of salary under certain situations. Upon death, the NEOs' beneficiary would continue to receive the NEO's salary for a period of time (2.99 years for Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore and one year for Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell). Upon disability, the NEO's salary would be continued until the earlier of (1) death, (2) the NEO's 65th birthday or (3) 2.99 years for Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore and 2 years for Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell.
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, health care benefits would be provided upon death (provided to the NEO's family) for a period of one year and upon disability for a period of two years.
Pursuant to the terms of all of the NEOs' outstanding restricted stock award agreements, all unvested restricted stock would immediately vest upon death or disability. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the SERP, upon termination due to disability, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore would be entitled to a continuation of crediting of additional years of cumulative service for a period of 2.99 years. Upon death or disability, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore are entitled to continuation of base salary pursuant to their employment agreements. If this benefit is less than the benefit otherwise payable under the SERP, the SERP benefit is net of the related benefit under their employment agreements.
Retirement
Pursuant to the provisions of each NEO's respective employment agreement, none of the NEOs would be eligible for a severance payment upon retirement. 
Pursuant to the terms of all of the NEOs' outstanding restricted stock award agreements, there would be no accelerated vesting of any unvested equity awards. 
35 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the provisions of the SERP, certain conditions allow for early retirement as early as age 55 and vesting under the plan is defined as 100% upon a participant's attainment of age 55 and 10 years of service. Since the SERP was adopted on December 31, 2006, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore have both attained the years of service requirement. At December 31, 2018, only Mr. Dunkel has attained the age requirement for vesting and is eligible for early retirement under the plan, which would be paid following a six-month period after retirement.
As there are no potential payments due to retirement at December 31, 2018, a column for this scenario has been omitted from the table below.
At Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018 
The following table displays the amounts that would have been payable to the NEOs for various service termination or CIC scenarios on December 31, 2018. The amounts that would actually be payable to the NEOs if employment termination or a CIC were to occur in the future would be different than those set forth below, which are calculated under the assumption that the event occurred on December 31, 2018 and based on the closing price of Kforce's common stock on the last trading day of the year. We note that such payments are contingent upon various factors in place at the time of the occurrence of the assumed event, including, but not limited to: each executive's current salary rate, annual incentive bonus awards and annual LTIs; the amount and type of unvested equity and other incentive awards held by the executive; the trading price of Kforce's common stock; the cost of providing employee benefits; the executive's elections of employee benefits; the executive's age and/or years of service with Kforce; the date of termination; the circumstances of the termination; and the executive's historical salary, bonuses and LTIs.

(1) If any payment or distribution by Kforce to Messrs. Dunkel or Liberatore is determined to be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, Messrs. Dunkel or Liberatore would be entitled to receive from Kforce a payment in an amount sufficient to place them in the same after-tax financial position that they would have been if they had not incurred any excise tax. The severance amounts do not include any excise tax gross up for Messrs. Dunkel or Liberatore as each of the respective calculations resulted in no excise tax amount. Employment agreements with Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell do not contain excise tax gross-up provisions and, thus, no amounts were included in the tables above. 
(2) The amounts represent the number of applicable unvested restricted stock shares on December 31, 2018, multiplied by $30.92, which was Kforce's closing stock price on that date. 
(3) For purposes of the Disability scenario, we have used 2.99 years for Mr. Liberatore and 2.00 years for Messrs. Kelly and Thomas and Ms. Mitchell as these are deemed to be the most probable outcomes if a disability occurred on December 31, 2018, given their current ages. Mr. Dunkel's amount is considered de minimus due to his current age. The annual payment amounts have been discounted at a rate of 4.25%, which is the lump sum conversion rate that was utilized for the SERP benefit at December 31, 2018. 
(4) These amounts represent the value of Kforce's portion of the health care benefits provided to each respective NEO consistent with those benefits received as of December 31, 2018. For purposes of the Disability scenario, Mr. Dunkel's portion is considered de minimus due to his current age. The annual benefit amounts have been discounted at a rate of 4.00%, which is the discount rate that was utilized for the SERP benefit at December 31, 2018. 
(5) These amounts represent the lump sum present value of the future monthly vested benefit as determined pursuant to the SERP, using a lump sum conversion rate of 4.25%. Upon death or disability, Messrs. Dunkel and Liberatore are entitled to continuation of base salary pursuant to their employment agreements. If this benefit is less than the benefit otherwise payable under the SERP, the SERP benefit disclosed is net of the related benefit under their employment agreements.

PROPOSAL 3. ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs, as disclosed in this proxy statement.
As described in the CD&A above, Kforce's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain our NEOs who are able to maximize shareholder value in an industry where we believe people represent the true "assets" of Kforce. Our Board believes that executive compensation levels are commensurate with Kforce's performance and shareholder return, promote a pay-for-performance philosophy and are strongly aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say On Pay" proposal, is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation disclosure rules.
This advisory vote on executive compensation is not binding, however, the Board and Compensation Committee value the opinions expressed by our shareholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions on our executive compensation.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Kforce's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter. An abstention is considered as present and entitled to vote and will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. A broker non-vote is considered not entitled to vote and will not affect the voting.

PROPOSAL 4. APPROVAL OF THE KFORCE INC. 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
Since the completion of its Initial Public Offering in August 1995, Kforce has had a series of key employee equity incentive plans, with the most recent being the Kforce Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2017 SIP). These plans were designed to provide an additional incentive to and for the retention of executives, employees and directors that we believe are key to the success of Kforce, especially given that we consider our people to be the true "assets" of Kforce. The Board believes these plans have been effective in providing such incentive and retention benefits. The Board also believes that for Kforce to continue to attract and retain outstanding individuals, it must continue to have incentive plans of these types in place. The remaining shares available for grant under the 2017 SIP are limited and will not satisfy Kforce's needs over the next two to three years.

The insufficiency of the remaining shares available for grant under the 2017 SIP would result in a critical element of our overall compensation structure either not being available or significantly limited. In addition, the Board believes that certain technical and design changes to the previous plans would be beneficial to the administration of the Plan. For these reasons, the Board believes it is in the best interests of Kforce and its shareholders to adopt a new 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2019 SIP) rather than amending the prior plans. Accordingly, in March 2019, the Board adopted the 2019 SIP, subject to shareholder approval. Therefore, the 2019 SIP will become effective only upon the shareholder approval. 
If the 2019 SIP is approved, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards under the 2017 SIP (the Share Reserve) will be: (1) 1,170,000 shares, plus (2) any shares of common stock that, as of the date this plan is approved by the shareholders of the Firm, are reserved and available for grant or issuance under the 2017 SIP, and are not issued or subject to outstanding grants (the 2017 SIP Reserved Shares). Upon the approval of the 2019 SIP by the shareholders of the Firm, no additional grants shall be made under the 2017 Plan. As of the date of the adoption of the 2019 SIP by the Board, the number of 2017 SIP Reserved Shares is 1,613,423 Shares. Therefore, as of the date of the adoption of the 2019 SIP by the Board, the Share Reserve is 2,783,423, subject to adjustment to reflect the grant, termination, cancellation, or forfeiture of outstanding awards under the 2017 SIP after the date of adoption of the 2019 SIP by the Board and prior to the approval by our shareholders. Each option or SAR granted shall reduce the Share Reserve by one share; and each full value share shall reduce the Share Reserve by 2.72 Shares. The aggregate number of shares of common stock available under the 2019 SIP is expected to last two to three years.
DESCRIPTION OF THE 2019 SIP, SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL
The following summary of the 2019 SIP is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the 2019 SIP as set forth in Appendix A.
Purposes. The purposes of the 2019 SIP are to attract and retain highly qualified individuals for and in positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to the Firm's employees and consultants in contributing to the success and progress of the Firm, and to align participants' interests directly to those of the Firm's shareholders through increased stock ownership.

Table of Contents
Awards. The 2019 SIP provides for awards of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock units), SARs, and other stock-based awards. The Board may adopt sub-plans applicable to particular foreign subsidiaries. With limited exceptions, the rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of the 2019 SIP.
Stock Subject to the 2019 SIP. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards under the 2019 SIP, subject to adjustment upon a change in capitalization, is 2,783,423, which includes shares that are reserved and available for grant and issuance under the 2017 SIP, and are not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2017 SIP. If any portion of an award under the 2019 SIP or the 2017 SIP, for any reason expires, is terminated, is canceled or is forfeited, the shares allocable to the expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited portion of the award will become available for future awards under the 2019 SIP at a rate of 2.72 shares for each expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited share. Each option or SAR granted under the 2017 SIP will reduce the number of shares available for future awards by one share, and each full value award share will reduce the available shares by 2.72 shares. Such shares may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired shares of common stock.
Administration. The 2019 SIP will be administered by the Committee. Subject to the other provisions of the 2019 SIP, the Committee has the power to determine the terms of each award granted, including the type of award, the exercise price of options, the number of shares subject to the award and the exercisability, vesting or settlement thereof.
Eligibility. The 2019 SIP provides that the Committee may grant awards to associates of the Firm and its subsidiaries, and to consultants, including non-employee directors. The Committee may grant incentive stock options only to employees. There are currently approximately 2,400 associates and 11,400 consultants (including nine non-employee directors) who are eligible to receive grants of awards under the 2019 SIP. A grantee who has received a grant of an award may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, receive additional award grants. The Committee selects the grantees and determines the number of shares of common stock to be subject to each award.
Maximum Awards for Non-Employee Directors. The 2019 SIP includes annual limits on the value of awards that may be granted to non-employee directors. A non-employee director may not receive options and SARs with an aggregate grant date fair value of more than $220,000 during any calendar year, and may not receive stock awards and other stock-based awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of more than $250,000 in any calendar year.
Maximum Term and General Terms and Conditions of Awards. With respect to any grantee who owns stock possessing ten percent or more of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Firm, the maximum term of any incentive stock option granted to such grantee must not exceed five years. The term of all other awards granted under the 2019 SIP may not exceed ten years, except that permissible deferrals of awards may extend beyond ten years. Each award granted under the 2019 SIP is evidenced by a written or electronic agreement between the grantee and Firm.
An award agreement may set forth the manner in which the grantee's death or termination of continuous status as an employee or consultant and related events will affect the award. However, in the absence of an explicit provision in the applicable award agreement, the 2019 SIP provides the default manner in which the grantee's termination will affect the grantee's awards. The default provisions in the 2019 SIP provide that upon a grantee's termination of continuous status as an employee or consultant for any reason, all of the grantee's outstanding unvested awards will be forfeited. If the grantee's continuous status as an employee or consultant is terminated for cause, all of the grantee's unexercised options and SARs will be forfeited. In the event of the grantee's death or termination of continuous status as an employee or consultant as a result of disability, the vested portions of the grantee's outstanding options and SARs may be exercised within 90 days following the grantee's death or termination, whichever is applicable. In the event of termination of the grantee's continuous status as an employee consultant for a reason other than death, disability, or cause, the vested portions of the grantee's outstanding options and SARs may be exercised within 30 days following the grantee's termination. Except as described below, an award granted under the 2019 SIP is not transferable by the grantee, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the grantee's lifetime only by the grantee. In the event of the grantee's death, an option or SAR may be exercised by a person who acquires the right to exercise the award by bequest or inheritance. To the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law and the Committee, a grantee may transfer an award to certain family members and other individuals and entities, but a transfer to a third party for value is not permitted.
Minimum Vesting Requirement. Except with respect to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the shares subject to the 2019 SIP, and except for a provision in the 2019 SIP or an individual award agreement or an employment agreement with the grantee for an acceleration of vesting in the event of the death or disability of the grantee or a change in control, no award will provide for vesting that is any more rapid than vesting on the one (1) year anniversary of the date of grant or, with respect to a performance-based award, a performance period that is less than twelve (12) months.
Options. The Committee will not grant to any employee in any calendar year options to purchase more than 500,000 shares of common stock, and will not grant to any consultant (excluding non-employee directors, who are subject to the annual limits on the value of options and SARs described above) in any calendar year options to purchase more than 100,000 shares. Each option granted under the 2019 SIP is subject to the following terms and conditions (the award agreement may contain other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the 2019 SIP, as determined by the Committee).
39 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Exercise Price. The Committee determines the exercise price of options to purchase shares of common stock at the time the options are granted. As a general rule, the exercise price of an option must be no less than 100 percent (110 percent for an incentive stock option granted to a grantee who owns stock possessing ten percent or more of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Firm) of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted. The closing market price per share of the common stock as of the Record Date was $38.61 per share. The 2019 SIP provides exceptions for certain options granted in connection with an acquisition by the Firm of another corporation.
Exercise of the Option. Each award agreement specifies the term and vesting of the option. The vesting provisions are determined by the Committee, subject to the minimum vesting requirement described above. An option is exercised by giving written or electronic notice of exercise to the Firm, specifying the number of full shares of common stock to be purchased and by tendering full payment of the purchase price to the Firm.
Form of Consideration. The award agreement specifies the option exercise procedures. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee in the award agreement, the acceptable form of consideration when exercising an option generally may consist of any combination of cash, personal check, wire transfer, other shares of Firm's common stock, or net exercise. 
Value Limitation. If the aggregate fair market value of all shares of common stock subject to a grantee's incentive stock option which are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the excess options will be treated as nonqualified options. For this purpose, fair market value is determined as of the grant date.
Holding Requirement. Each grantee who is an NEO will be required hold the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an option for a minimum period of one year following the date of exercise.
Stock Appreciation Rights. The exercise of a SAR will entitle the grantee to receive the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over the base price for each share with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The base price of a SAR must be no less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the SAR is granted. The closing market price per share of the common stock as of the Record Date was $38.61 per share. The terms of the vesting of a SAR are determined by the Committee, subject to the minimum vesting requirement described above. During any calendar year, the Committee will not grant to any employee SARs covering more than 500,000 shares, and will not grant to any consultant (excluding non-employee directors, who are subject to the annual limits on the aggregate value of options and SARs described above) SARs covering more than 100,000 shares. Payment upon exercise of a SAR may be in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee. SARs may be exercised by the delivery to the Firm of a written or electronic notice of exercise. Each grantee who is an NEO will be required hold the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of a SAR for a minimum period of one year following the date of exercise.
Stock Awards. A stock award may be made in shares of common stock or in units representing rights to receive shares. During any fiscal year of the Firm, no stock awards covering more than 500,000 shares of common stock may be granted to any employee, and no stock awards covering more than 100,000 shares may be granted to any consultant (excluding non-employee directors, who are subject to the annual limits on the aggregate value of options and other stock-based awards described above). Subject to the minimum vesting requirement described above, the award agreement will set forth any vesting, forfeiture, settlement, or payment conditions applicable to the stock award. Conditions for effectiveness or vesting may be time-based, performance-based, or both time-based and performance-based. A stock award made in shares may be designated as an award of restricted stock, and a stock award denominated in units may be designated as an award of restricted stock units or RSUs. An award of restricted stock generally entitles the grantee to voting rights, and may entitle the grantee to dividend and other ownership rights, during the period in which the award is subject to forfeiture conditions. Although an award of RSUs generally will not provide any shareholder rights to the grantee until such time, if any, as the underlying shares are actually issued to the grantee, the Committee may provide in a restricted stock unit award agreement for the payment of dividend equivalents. However, the grantee will not receive payment of any dividends or dividend equivalents unless and until the stock award has become vested.
Other Stock-Based Awards and Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may grant other stock-based awards in such amounts, on such terms and conditions, and for such consideration, including no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, as the Committee determines in its discretion. Other stock-based awards may be denominated in cash, in shares of common stock or other securities, in units, in securities or debentures convertible into common stock, or in any combination of the foregoing, and may be paid in cash, in shares of common stock or other securities, or in any combination of the foregoing, all as determined in the discretion of the Committee. Subject to the minimum vesting requirement described above, the terms and conditions of any other stock-based award may include, without limitation, terms and conditions relating to dividend and voting rights, as well as time-based and/or performance-based, or other condition(s) on the effectiveness or vesting of the award. However, the grantee will not receive payment of any dividends or dividend equivalents unless and until the award has become vested. During any calendar year, no other stock-based awards covering more than 500,000 shares of common stock may be granted to any employee, and no other stock-based awards covering more than 100,000 shares may be granted to any consultant (excluding non-employee directors, who are subject to the annual limits on the aggregate value of stock awards and other stock-based awards described above). The maximum amount that a grantee may earn by satisfaction of performance goals during any calendar year under other stock-based awards that are denominated in cash or any medium other than shares or units representing rights to receive shares is $7,500,000. For purposes of the limitation stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year in which the applicable performance goal(s) is satisfied is the calendar year in which the limitation applies, without regard to the duration of the performance period or any additional time-based vesting conditions or other terms or conditions relating to the payment of the other stock-based award.

Table of Contents
Performance-Based Awards. The Committee may grant options, SARs, stock awards and/or other stock-based awards with respect to which the amount, grant, vesting, or settlement is contingent upon the achievement of specific performance goals. The Committee will determine the performance goal(s), the performance period, and the performance measure(s) that will be applied with respect to each such award at the time of grant. 
The Committee will establish the performance goal or goals for the applicable performance period based upon the performance measure selected by the Committee to apply to each award and a formula or matrix prescribing the extent to which such award will be granted and/or vested based upon the level of achievement of such performance goal or goals. The Committee may establish different performance goals for different grantees and different awards. The performance goals with respect to such performance measurement criteria may be established at such levels and in such terms as the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including in absolute terms, as a goal relative to performance in prior periods, or as a goal compared to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies. The performance goals may be established in terms of Firm-wide objectives or objectives that are related to the performance of the individual grantee or the subsidiary, division, department, or function within the Firm or subsidiary in which the Grantee is employed, or any other manner that the Committee determines appropriate in its discretion. Performance goals need not be based on audited financial results.
Notwithstanding the achievement of any performance goal and any contrary provision of the 2019 SIP, the Committee may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of compensation otherwise to be paid or earned in connection with an award. The Committee may determine performance before payment of bonuses, capital charges, non-recurring income or expense, items of an unusual nature or of a type that indicates infrequency of occurrence, or other financial and general and administrative expenses for the performance period, and may measure the attainment of the performance goal by appropriately adjusting the evaluation of performance goal performance to exclude the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Firm's or a business unit's reported results. The Committee may establish additional rules and procedures relating to the Committee's ability to adjust aspects of a performance-based award, including the ability to increase or decrease the amount of compensation payable under the award, and the Committee's certification or other determination of the extent to which performance goals have or have not been achieved.
Adjustment upon Changes in Capitalization.  In the event of changes in the common stock by reason of any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, or other change in the capital structure of Firm or extraordinary dividend, spinoff, or similar event affecting the value of common stock, an appropriate adjustment will be made by the Board in the number of shares of common stock subject to the 2019 SIP, the number of shares subject to any award outstanding under the 2019 SIP, the exercise price of any such outstanding award, any share-based performance condition, and the annual per-person limitations on awards. The determination of the Board as to which adjustments will be made will be conclusive.
Change in Control. In the event of a change in control of the Firm, then the following provisions apply:
Vesting. In the event of a change in control of the Firm, the Board may accelerate the vesting of any outstanding award that is not fully vested on the date of the change in control.
Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Firm, all outstanding awards will terminate immediately before the consummation of such proposed action. The Board may, in the exercise of its discretion in such instances, declare that any option or SAR will terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each grantee the right to exercise his option or SAR as to all or any part of the shares covered by such award, including shares as to which the award would not otherwise be exercisable.
Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the firm with or into another corporation, the sale of substantially all of the assets of the firm or the acquisition by any person, other than the Firm or other named persons expressly excluded in the 2019 SIP, of 50 percent or more of the Firm's then outstanding securities, each award will be assumed or an equivalent award will be substituted by the successor corporation; provided, however, if such successor or purchaser refuses to assume the then outstanding awards, the Board may accelerate the vesting of any outstanding award that is not fully vested on the date of the change in control.
Restriction on Repricing. The 2019 SIP expressly prohibits any modification or amendment of an option or SAR that constitutes a "repricing" under the NASDAQ listing rules, unless the Firm's shareholders approve the modification or amendment. For this purpose, a "repricing" is generally defined as lowering the exercise or base price of an option or SAR after it is granted, any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles, or granting a new award or cash in exchange for the cancellation of an option or SAR with an exercise price or base price that exceeds the current fair market value of the underlying stock, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction. The definition of "repricing" also includes any other action that has the same effect as one of these prohibited actions. Adjustments to the exercise price or number of shares subject to an option or SAR to reflect the effects of a stock split or other extraordinary corporate transaction will not constitute a "repricing."
Amendment and Termination of the 2019 SIP. The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the 2019 SIP. The Firm will obtain shareholder approval of any amendment to the 2019 SIP in such a manner and to such a degree as is necessary and desirable to comply with any applicable law or regulation, including the requirements of any exchange on which the common stock is listed or quoted. Under these laws and regulations, however, shareholder approval will not necessarily be required for all amendments which might increase the cost of the 2019 SIP or broaden eligibility. Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the 2019 SIP will terminate on April 23, 2029. Any awards outstanding under the 2019 SIP at the time of its termination will remain outstanding until they expire by their terms.

Tax Consequences. The federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2019 SIP are complex and subject to change. The following discussion is only a summary of the general tax rules applicable to the 2019 SIP.
Options. Options granted under the 2019 SIP may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Options that are designated as incentive stock options are intended to qualify as such under Section 422 of the Code. With respect to incentive stock options, neither the grant nor the exercise of the option will subject the employee to taxable income, other than under the Alternative Minimum Tax (Section 56(b)(3) of the Code), which is not discussed in detail in this summary. There is no required tax withholding in connection with the exercise of incentive stock options. Upon the ultimate disposition of the stock obtained on an exercise of an incentive stock option, the employee's entire gain will be taxed at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided the employee has satisfied the prescribed holding periods relating to incentive stock options and the underlying stock. This treatment will apply to the entire amount of gain recognized on the sale of the stock, including the portion of gain that reflects the spread on the date of exercise between the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant and the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise.
The Firm does not receive a compensation deduction for tax purposes with respect to incentive stock options. However, if the employee disposes of the stock purchased on exercise of the incentive stock option prior to the expiration of the applicable holding periods required by Section 422 of the Code, the Firm will be entitled to a deduction equal to the employee's realization of ordinary income by virtue of the employee's disqualifying disposition.
Non-qualified stock options granted under the 2019 SIP will not qualify for any special tax benefits to the option holder. An option holder generally will not recognize any taxable income at the time he or she is granted a non-qualified option. However, upon its exercise, the option holder will recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price. The income realized by the option holder will be subject to income and other employee withholding taxes.
The option holder's basis for determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized as a result of the exercise of such option. Upon disposition of any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the difference between the sale price and the option holder's basis in the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be characterized as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year at the time of their disposition.
In general, there will be no federal income tax deduction allowed to the Firm upon the grant or termination of a nonqualified stock option or a sale or disposition of the shares acquired upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option. However, upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option by a holder, the Firm will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that an option holder is required to recognize as a result of the exercise, provided that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under the Code.
Stock Awards and Stock Appreciation Rights. With respect to stock awards and SARs that may be settled either in cash or in shares that are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee will realize ordinary taxable income, subject to tax withholding, equal to the amount of the cash or the fair market value of the shares received. The Firm will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount and at the same time as the compensation income is received by the grantee. With respect to restricted stock award shares that are both nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the award recipient will realize ordinary taxable income equal to the fair market value of the shares at the first time the shares are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The Firm will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount and at the same time as the ordinary taxable income realized by the grantee. 
Some awards, such as restricted stock unit awards, may be considered to be deferred compensation subject to special federal income tax rules under Section 409A of the Code. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements under Section 409A of the Code for such awards would result in the acceleration of income and additional income tax liability to the grantee, including certain penalties. The 2019 SIP and awards under the 2019 SIP are intended to be designed and administered so that any awards that are considered to be deferred compensation will not result in negative tax consequences to the grantees under Section 409A of the Code.
All of the above-described deductions are subject to the limitations on deductibility described in Section 162(m) of the Code. Therefore, there can be no assurance that compensation attributable to 2019 SIP awards will be fully deductible under all circumstances. In addition, as a result of the provisions of Section 280G of the Code, compensation paid to certain employees resulting from vesting of awards in connection with a change in control of the Firm also may not be deductible.
The foregoing is only a summary of the effect of federal income taxation upon the award recipient and the Firm with respect to the grant and exercise of awards under the 2019 SIP, does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax consequences of the recipient's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which a recipient may reside.
New Plan Benefits. All awards under the 2019 SIP are made at the discretion of the Committee. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the 2019 SIP in the future are not determinable at this time.

RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD
The Board believes that the proposed 2019 SIP is necessary to ensure that a sufficient number of shares will be available to fund our compensation programs. If our shareholders do not approve this Plan, we will experience a shortfall of shares available for issuance that we believe may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and reward NEOs and other key employees who contribute to our long-term success.
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter. An abstention is considered as present and entitled to vote and will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. A broker non-vote is considered not entitled to vote and will not affect the voting.

There are no statutory or contractual rights of appraisal or similar remedies available to those shareholders who dissent from any matter to be acted on at the Annual Meeting.
Who is entitled to vote?

How do I vote?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Kforce's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (Computershare), then you are the shareholder of record with respect to those shares and you may vote your shares by any one of the following methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee then you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name" and your bank, broker or nominee is the shareholder of record, however, as the beneficial owner you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. If you hold your shares in street name then please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, broker or nominee when voting your shares. Please note, if you hold your shares in street name you must obtain a legal proxy in your name from your bank, broker or other nominee to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.
Can I change my vote?
You may change your vote at any time before the Annual Meeting by using the Internet or telephone methods described above, in which case only your latest submission will be counted. You may also change your vote by signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date, attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, or sending written notice of revocation before the Annual Meeting to our Corporate Secretary at the Firm's principal executive offices located at 1001 East Palm Avenue, Tampa, Florida 33605.
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares entitled to vote will constitute a quorum.

Table of Contents
How are my shares voted if I submit a proxy but do not specify how I want to vote?
If you are the shareholder of record and you submit a valid proxy without specifying how you want to vote, then the person(s) designated as proxy holders will vote your shares as recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and at their discretion on all other matters properly presented. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide your bank, broker or nominee with specific voting instructions then the organization that holds your shares may generally vote in their discretion on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares in a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Which proposals are considered "routine" or "non-routine"?
Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Firm's independent registered public accountant for 2019 (Proposal 2) is considered a routine matter under applicable rules and each of the other proposals are considered non-routine. Therefore, if your shares are held in "street name" by your broker or other nominee and you do not provide instructions on how to vote your shares then your broker or nominee will permitted to vote its shares only with regards to Proposal 2 and will not be permitted to vote on the other matters.
Assuming that a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, what is the required vote for the proposals to pass?
Please see the respective proposal for a description of the vote required for it to pass.
Who will count the vote?
A representative of Computershare, an independent tabulator, will count the vote and act as the inspector of elections.
Who is paying the costs of this proxy solicitation?
Kforce will pay the costs of soliciting these proxies on behalf of the Board. We have engaged Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies and we anticipate that the costs associated with this engagement will be approximately $12,500 plus out-of-pocket expenses. We will also pay brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to our shareholders and obtaining beneficial owners' voting instructions. In addition to mailing proxy solicitation material, our directors and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by electronic communication.
How can I find the results of the Annual Meeting?
Preliminary results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Final results will be published in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

3. Stock Subject to the Plan. Subject to the provisions of Section 12 of the Plan, the aggregate number of Shares of Common Stock that may be subject to awards under this Plan (the "Share Reserve") is (i) 1,170,000 Shares, plus (ii) any Shares of Common Stock that, as of the date this Plan is approved by the shareholders of the Firm, are reserved and available for grant and issuance under the Kforce Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan"), and are not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2017 Plan (respectively, the "2017 Plan Reserved Shares").

As of the date of the adoption of this Plan by the Board, the number of 2017 Plan Reserved Shares is 1,613,423 Shares. Therefore, as of the date of the adoption of this Plan by the Board, the Share Reserve is 2,783,423, subject to adjustment to reflect the grant, termination, cancellation, or forfeiture of outstanding awards under the 2017 Plan after the date of adoption of this Plan by the Board and prior to the approval of this Plan by the shareholders of the Firm. In no event shall the number of Shares issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options exceed the Share Reserve. Each Option or SAR granted shall reduce the Share Reserve by one Share; and each full value share (Stock Award) shall reduce the Share Reserve by 2.72 Shares. Such shares of Common Stock may be authorized, but unissued, or reacquired shares of Common Stock. The Shares issued by the Firm under the Plan may be, at the Firm's option, either (i) evidenced by a certificate registered in the name of the Grantee, or (ii) credited to a book-entry account for the benefit of the Grantee maintained by the Firm's stock transfer agent or its designee.
If any portion of an Award granted under the Plan for any reason expires, is terminated, is canceled or is forfeited (including those forfeited as a result of not being earned pursuant to the Award's performance criteria), then (i) with respect to Options and SARs, the Shares underlying such Award shall be restored to the Share Reserve on a one-for-one basis and shall become available for future Awards under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated); and (B) with respect to each Award other than an Option or SAR, the Shares underlying such Award shall be restored to the Share Reserve at a rate of 2.72 Shares for each expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited Share and shall become available for future Awards under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated).  If any portion of an outstanding award that was granted under the 2017 Plan or any other prior plan maintained by the Firm for any reason expires, is terminated, is canceled or is forfeited on or after the date on which the shareholders of the Firm approve this Plan, then (i) with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, the Shares underlying such award shall be added to the Share Reserve on a one-for-one basis and shall become available for future Awards under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated); and (B) with respect to each award other than an option or stock appreciation right, the Shares underlying such award shall be added to the Share Reserve at a rate of 2.72 Shares for each expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited Share and shall become available for future Awards under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). With respect to an Option and SAR, if the payment upon exercise of an Option or SAR is in the form of Shares, the Shares subject to the Option or SAR shall be counted against the Share Reserve as one Share for every Share subject to the Option or SAR, regardless of the number of Shares used to settle the Option or SAR upon exercise.

(vi) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan (including the minimum vesting provision in Sections 5(c) of the Plan and the holding requirements applicable to certain Options and SARs in Section 6(f)(ii) and 7(e) of the Plan), of any Award granted under the Plan. Such terms and conditions, which need not be the same for each Award or for each Grantee, include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Options and SARs may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), the extent to which vesting is suspended during a leave of absence, any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Committee shall determine;  
(vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards;  
(viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, rules and regulations relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local and foreign laws and procedures;

(ix) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 14 of the Plan). However, the Administrator's authority to modify or amend an Award is expressly limited in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c). Therefore, any modification or amendment of an Option or SAR that would be treated as a "repricing" under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) shall not be effective without the approval of the shareholders of the Firm. For purposes of this Section 4(b)(ix) of the Plan, "repricing" means any of the following or any other action that has the same effect:  
a. lowering the exercise price of an Option or SAR after it is granted;  
b. any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles; or c. canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares, in exchange for another Award or cash, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off, or other similar corporate transaction; 
(x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Firm any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Committee;  
(xi) to determine the terms and restrictions applicable to Awards;  
(xii) to make such adjustments or modifications to Awards granted to Grantees who are Employees of foreign Subsidiaries as are advisable to fulfill the purposes of the Plan or to comply with Applicable Law;  
(xiii) to delegate its duties and responsibilities under the Plan with respect to sub-plans applicable to foreign Subsidiaries, except its duties and responsibilities with respect to Employees who are also Officers or Directors subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act;  
(xiv) to correct any defect or supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, or in any Award Agreement, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective;  
(xv) to provide any notice, agreement or other communication required or permitted by the Plan in either written or electronic form; 
(xvi) subject to the minimum vesting provision in Sections 5(c) of the Plan, to determine the vesting period during which each Award shall be subject to a risk of forfeiture upon a voluntary termination of employment or service, or termination in other specified circumstances, and the terms upon which such risk will end (i.e., "vesting" will occur), at a stated date or dates or on an accelerated basis in specified circumstances; and  
(xvii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.  
(c) Effect of Administrator's Decision. The Committee's decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Grantees and any other holders of Awards.  
[END TABLE]
5. Eligibility and General Conditions of Awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Eligibility. Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to Employees and Consultants. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. If otherwise eligible, an Employee or Consultant who has been granted an Award may be granted additional Awards. Modifications to outstanding Awards may be made without regard to whether the Grantee is then currently eligible for a new Award. 
(b) Maximum Term; Deferral. Subject to the following provision, the term during which an Award may be outstanding shall not extend more than 10 years after the Date of Grant and shall be subject to earlier termination as specified elsewhere in the Plan or Award Agreement. The Committee may permit or require a Grantee to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due by virtue of the grant of or the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Awards other than Options and SARs. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Committee shall establish such rules and procedures for such deferral, including rules and procedures implemented pursuant to Section 21 of the Plan for compliance with Code Section 409A. Any deferral of a cash payment or of the delivery of Shares that is permitted or required by the Committee may, if so permitted or required by the Committee, extend more than ten years after the Date of Grant of the Award to which the deferral relates.  
(c) Minimum Vesting. Except with respect to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the Share Reserve, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan, and except for the death or disability of the grantee, or a change in control, no Award shall provide for vesting that is any more rapid than vesting on the one (1) year anniversary of the date of grant or, with respect to a performance-based award, a performance period that is less than twelve (12) months. Treatment of Awards in cases of death, disability, and change in control may be specifically addressed in the Plan or an individual award agreement or an employment agreement with the grantee. 
(d) Award Agreement. To the extent not set forth in the Plan, the terms and conditions of each Award, which need not be the same for each Award or for each Grantee, shall be set forth in an Award Agreement. The Committee, in its discretion, may require as a condition to any Award Agreement's effectiveness that the Award Agreement be executed by the Grantee, including by electronic signature or other electronic indication of acceptance, and that the Grantee agree to such further terms and conditions as specified in the Award Agreement.

(e) Maximum Awards to Non-Employee Directors. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan, the following limitations shall apply to Awards granted to non-Employee Directors under the Plan: (i) the maximum number of Shares subject to Options and SARs granted under the Plan to any non-Employee Director during any calendar year shall not exceed $220,000 in total value (the "Non-Employee Director Option/SAR Limit"), and (ii) the maximum number of Shares subject to Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards granted under the Plan to any non-Employee Director during any calendar year shall not exceed $250,000 in total value, excluding for this purpose the value of any dividends or Dividend Equivalents paid pursuant to any Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards granted in a previous year (the "Non-Employee Director Full Value Award Limit"). For purposes of the Non-Employee Director Option/SAR Limit and the Non-Employee Director Full Value Award Limit, the value of any Award shall be its Date of Grant fair value for the Firm's financial reporting purposes. 
(f) Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship. In the event that a Grantee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates (other than upon the Grantee's death or Disability), then, unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement or an employment agreement with the Grantee, and subject to Section 12 of the Plan:  
(i) Subject to Section 5(f)(ii) below, the Grantee may exercise his or her unexercised Option or SAR within 30 days of the Date of Termination and only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise it at the Date of Termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). If, at the Date of Termination, the Grantee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve. If, after the Date of Termination, the Grantee does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within 30 days, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve. If a Grantee exercises his or her unexercised Option or SAR subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Grantee is not permitted to utilize Shares to cover the exercise cost of the Option or SAR or to cover their minimum payroll tax withholding obligations;  
(ii) in the event that a Grantee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates for Cause, all of his or her unexercised Options or SARs shall terminate immediately upon the Date of Termination and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve; 
(iii) the Grantee's Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited;  
(iv) the Grantee's Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards that were not forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination shall promptly be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement; and  
(v) any Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards subject to performance criteria with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the Date of Termination shall terminate immediately upon the Date of Termination.  
(g) Disability of Grantee. In the event that a Grantee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the Grantee's Disability, then, unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement or an employment agreement with the Grantee:  
(i) the Grantee may exercise his or her unexercised Option or SAR at any time within 90 days from the Date of Termination, but only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise the Option or SAR at the Date of Termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of the Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). If, at the Date of Termination, the Grantee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve. If, after the Date of Termination, the Grantee does not exercise his or her Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve.  
(ii) the Grantee's Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited;  
(iii) the Grantee's Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards that were not forfeitable immediately before the Date of Termination shall promptly be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Award Agreement; and 
(iv) any Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards subject to performance criteria with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the Date of Termination shall terminate immediately upon the Date of Termination.  
(h) Death of Grantee. In the event of the death of a Grantee, then, unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement or an employment agreement with the Grantee,  
(i) the Grantee's unexercised Option or SAR may be exercised at any time within 90 days following the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Grantee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent that the Grantee was entitled to exercise the Option or SAR at the date of death. If, at the time of death, the Grantee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option or SAR, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option or SAR shall immediately revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve. If, after death, the Grantee's estate or a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance does not exercise the Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Option or SAR shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option or SAR shall revert to the Plan and increase the Share Reserve.

(ii) the Grantee's Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards, to the extent forfeitable immediately before the date of death, shall thereupon automatically be forfeited;

(iv) any Stock Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards subject to performance criteria with respect to which the Performance Period has not ended as of the date of death shall terminate immediately upon the date of death.  
(i) Nontransferability of Awards.  
(i) Except as provided in Section 5(i)(iii) below, each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable only by the Grantee during the Grantee's lifetime, or, if permissible under Applicable Law, by the Grantee's guardian or legal representative.  
(ii) Except as provided in Section 5(i)(iii) below, no Award (prior to the time, if applicable, Shares are issued in respect of such Award), and no right under any Award, may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Grantee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or in the case of Restricted Stock Awards, to the Firm) and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Firm or any Subsidiary; provided, that the designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance.  
(iii) To the extent and in the manner permitted by Applicable Law, and to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Committee, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Committee, a Grantee may transfer an Award to:  
a. a child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the Grantee (including adoptive relationships);  
b. any person sharing the employee's household (other than a tenant or employee);  
c. a trust in which persons described in (a) and (b) have more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest;  
d. a foundation in which persons described in (a) or (b) or the Grantee control the management of assets; or e. any other entity in which the persons described in (a) or (b) or the Grantee own more than 50 percent of the voting interests;  
[END TABLE]
provided such transfer is not for value. The following shall not be considered transfers for value: a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights, and a transfer to an entity in which more than 50 percent of the voting interests are owned by persons described in (a) above or the Grantee, in exchange for an interest in such entity. 
6. Stock Options. Subject to the terms of the Plan, including without limitation the minimum vesting provision in Section 5(c) of the Plan, the Committee may grant Options to Employees or Consultants from time to time upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in accordance with the following provisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Limitations.  
(i) Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, or a combination of the foregoing.  Each Award shall specify whether (or the extent to which) the Option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option.  Notwithstanding any such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares as of the Date of Grant with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Grantee during any calendar year (under the Plan and any other employee stock option plan of the Firm or any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. 
(ii) No Employee shall be granted, in any calendar year, Options to purchase more than 500,000 Shares, and no Consultant (other than a non-Employee Director, who is subject to the Non-Employee Director Option/SAR Limit in Section 5(e) of the Plan) shall be granted, in any calendar year, Options to purchase more than 100,000 Shares. The limitation described in this Section 6(a)(ii) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Firm's capitalization as described in Section 12 of the Plan. If an Option is canceled in the same calendar year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 12 of the Plan), the canceled Option will be counted against the limitation described in this Section 6(a)(ii).  
(b) Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that the term shall be 10 years from the Date of Grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Grantee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Firm or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5) years from the Date of Grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
(c) Option Exercise Price and Consideration.  
(i) Exercise Price. The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Committee and, except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(c)(i), shall be no less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Date of Grant.  
a. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who on the Date of Grant owns stock representing more than 10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Firm or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Date of Grant.  
b. Any Option that is (1) granted to a Grantee in connection with the acquisition ("Acquisition"), however effected, by the Firm of another corporation or entity ("Acquired Entity") or the assets thereof, (2) associated with an option to purchase shares of stock or other equity interest of the Acquired Entity or an affiliate thereof ("Acquired Entity Option") held by such Grantee immediately prior to such Acquisition, and (3) intended to preserve for the Grantee the economic value of all or a portion of such Acquired Entity Option, may be granted with such exercise price as the Committee determines to be necessary to achieve such preservation of economic value.  
(d) Waiting Period and Exercise Dates. At the time an Option is granted, the Committee shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised. An Option shall be exercisable only to the extent that it is vested according to the terms of the Award Agreement.  
(e) Form of Consideration. The Committee shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Committee shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of Award. The acceptable form of consideration may consist of any combination of cash, personal check, wire transfer or, subject to the approval of the Committee:  
(i) net exercise, in which case the Firm will not require payment of the Option exercise price from the Grantee but will reduce the number of Shares issued upon the exercise by the number of whole Shares that has an aggregate Fair Market Value that is equal to the aggregate Option exercise price for the portion of the Option exercised;  
(ii) pursuant to procedures approved by the Committee, (A) through the sale of the Shares acquired on exercise of the Option through a broker-dealer to whom the Grantee has submitted an irrevocable notice of exercise and irrevocable instructions to deliver promptly to the Firm the amount of sale or loan proceeds sufficient to pay the exercise price, together with, if requested by the Firm, the amount of federal, state, local or foreign withholding taxes payable by the Grantee by reason of such exercise, or (B) through simultaneous sale through a broker of Shares acquired upon exercise; or  
(iii)  such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.  
(f) Exercise of Option.  
(i) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.  
a. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. 
b. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.  
c. An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Firm receives:  
i. written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement and any action taken by the Committee pursuant to Section 4.b. of the Plan) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and ii. full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised.  Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Committee and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan.  
iii. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Grantee or, if requested by the Grantee, in the name of the Grantee and his or her spouse (or other permitted transferee). Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued or delivery is otherwise effected by the Firm (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Firm or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Firm), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Firm shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate, or provide a commercially reasonable alternative means of delivery, promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued or delivery is otherwise effected by the Firm, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  
iv. Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.  
(ii) Holding Requirement. As a condition to the grant of an Option to a Grantee who is a Named Executive Officer, the Grantee shall hold the Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option for a minimum period of one year following the date of exercise.

7. Stock Appreciation Rights. Subject to the terms of the Plan, including without limitation the minimum vesting provision in Section 5(c) of the Plan, the Committee may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Employees or Consultants from time to time upon such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in accordance with the following provisions. A SAR shall be exercisable only to the extent that it is vested according to the terms of the Award Agreement.  A SAR is the right of the Grantee to receive from the Firm an amount in Shares equal to the Spread at the time of the exercise of such right. The term of each SAR shall be stated in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that the term shall be 10 years from the Date of Grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Base Price. The Base Price shall be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant. 
(b) Exercise of SARs. SARs shall be exercised by the delivery of a written or electronic notice of exercise to the Firm (in accordance with the Award Agreement and any action taken by the Committee pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Plan or otherwise), setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is to be exercised. 
(c) Payment of SAR Benefit. Upon exercise of a SAR, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment in the form of Shares from the Firm in an amount determined by multiplying:  
(i) the Spread; by  
(ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised; provided, that the Committee may provide in the Award Agreement that the benefit payable on exercise of a SAR shall not exceed such limit (which may be expressed as a percentage of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant or as a fixed value limit or otherwise) as the Committee shall specify. The payment upon exercise of a SAR shall be in Shares that have an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date of exercise of the SAR) equal to the amount of the payment.  
[END TABLE]
Until the stock certificate evidencing such Shares is issued or delivery is otherwise effected by the Firm (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Firm or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Firm), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Covered Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the SAR. The Firm shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate, or provide a commercially reasonable alternative means of delivery, promptly after the SAR is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued or delivery is otherwise effected by the Firm, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d) No Employee shall be granted, in any calendar year, SARs with respect to more than 500,000 Shares, and no Consultant (other than a non-Employee Director, who is subject to the Non-Employee Director Option/SAR Limit in Section 5(e) of the Plan) shall be granted, in any calendar year, SARs to purchase more than 100,000 Shares. The limitation described in this Section 7(d) shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Firm's capitalization as described in Section 11 of the Plan. If a SAR is canceled in the same calendar year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 11 of the Plan), the canceled SAR will be counted against the limitation described in this Section 7(d).  
(e) As a condition to the grant of a SAR to a Grantee who is a Named Executive Officer, the Grantee shall hold the Shares acquired upon exercise of the SAR for a minimum period of one year following the date of exercise. 
[END TABLE]
8. Stock Awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Administrator Action. Subject to the terms of the Plan, including without limitation the minimum vesting provision in Section 5(c) of the Plan, the Committee, acting in its discretion, may grant Stock Awards to any Employee or Consultant from time to time, in such amount and upon such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee. A Stock Award may be made in Shares or denominated in units representing rights to receive Shares. No Stock Award relating to more than 500,000 Shares may be granted to an Employee in any calendar year, and no Stock Award relating to more than 100,000 Shares may be granted to any Consultant (other than a non-Employee Director, who is subject to the Non-Employee Director Full Value Award Limit in Section 5(e) of the Plan) in any calendar year. Each Stock Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, and each Award Agreement shall set forth the conditions, if any, that will need to be timely satisfied before the Stock Award will be effective, vested and settled, and the conditions, if any, under which the Grantee's interest in the related Shares or units will be forfeited. Any such conditions for effectiveness or nonforfeitability may be based upon the passage of time and continued service by the Grantee, or the achievement of specified performance objectives, or both time-based and performance-based conditions. The Committee, acting in its discretion, may make the grant of a Stock Award to a Grantee subject to the satisfaction of one, or more than one, objective employment, performance, or other grant condition that the Committee deems appropriate under the circumstances for Employees or Consultants generally or for a Grantee in particular, and the related Award Agreement shall set forth each such condition and the deadline for satisfying each such grant condition. Either as an alternative to or in addition to a condition on the effectiveness of the grant of a Stock Award, the Committee may make a Stock Award (if, when, and to the extent that the grant of the Stock Award becomes effective) subject to one, or more than one, objective employment, performance, or other forfeiture condition that the Committee acting in its discretion deems appropriate under the circumstances for Employees or Consultants generally or for a Grantee in particular, and the related Award Agreement shall set forth each such condition and the deadline for satisfying each such forfeiture condition. A Grantee's nonforfeitable interest in the Shares related to a grant of a Stock Award shall depend on the extent to which each such condition is timely satisfied. 
[END TABLE]
55 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Types of Stock Awards. A Stock Award made in Shares that are subject to forfeiture conditions and/or other restrictions may be designated as an Award of "Restricted Stock." A Stock Award denominated in units that are subject to forfeiture conditions and/or other restrictions may be designated as an Award of "Restricted Stock Units" or "RSUs." For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee is authorized to grant Shares as a bonus, or to grant Shares or other Awards in lieu of obligations of the Firm or a Subsidiary to pay cash or deliver other property under the Plan or under other plans or compensatory arrangements, subject to such terms as shall be determined by the Committee. 
(c) Dividend Rights.  
(i) Restricted Stock Award. Each Restricted Stock Award Agreement shall state whether the Grantee shall have a right to receive any cash dividends that are paid with respect to his or her Restricted Stock after the date his or her Restricted Stock Award has become effective and before the first day that the Grantee's interest in such stock is forfeited completely or becomes completely vested and nonforfeitable. The Grantee shall not receive any payment of any dividends that are paid with respect to a Share of Restricted Stock unless and not earlier than such time as the Share becomes vested and nonforfeitable, and the Award Agreement shall (subject to Section 21 and other applicable requirements of Code Section 409A) set forth the conditions, if any, under which the Grantee will be eligible to receive payment(s) in the future of the cumulative cash dividends (without interest) payable on the Shares that become vested and nonforfeitable for the period beginning on the effective date of the Award and ending on the vesting date of the Award. If an Award Agreement calls for any such payments to be made, the Firm shall make such payments from the Firm's general assets, and the Grantee shall be no more than a general and unsecured creditor of the Firm with respect to such payments. If a stock dividend is declared on such a Share after the Award is effective but before the Grantee's interest in such Stock has been forfeited or has become nonforfeitable, such stock dividend shall be treated as part of the Award of the related Restricted Stock, and a Grantee's interest in such stock dividend shall be forfeited or shall become vested and nonforfeitable at the same time as the Share with respect to which the stock dividend was paid is forfeited or becomes vested and nonforfeitable. If a dividend is paid other than in cash or stock, the disposition of such dividend shall be made in accordance with such rules as the Committee shall adopt with respect to each such dividend, which shall include a provision that the Grantee shall not receive any payment of any such dividends unless and not earlier than such time as the applicable Share becomes vested and nonforfeitable. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any provision of an Award Agreement or the absence of any Award Agreement provision relating to dividends, (a) no dividend or distribution declared with respect to a Share of Restricted Stock shall be paid to a Grantee unless and until the Share becomes vested and nonforfeitable, (b) a Grantee shall not have a vested and nonforfeitable right to any dividend or distribution declared with respect to a Share of Restricted Stock unless and until the Share becomes vested and nonforfeitable, and (c) a Grantee's right to any dividend or distribution declared with respect to a Share of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited to the extent that the Grantee's right to the Share is forfeited. 
(ii) RSU Award. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Grantee shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to Shares underlying an Award of RSUs until such time, if any, as the underlying Shares are actually issued to the Grantee. The Committee may provide in an RSU Award Agreement for the payment of Dividend Equivalents to the Grantee at the time of vesting of the RSUs or other payout of the vested RSUs. The Award Agreement shall provide whether such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash or converted into additional shares of Common Stock or RSUs by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as may be determined by the Committee. The Grantee shall not receive any payment of any Dividend Equivalent with respect to any RSU unless and not earlier than such time as the RSU becomes vested and nonforfeitable. The payment or crediting of Dividend Equivalents shall conform to the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any provision of an Award Agreement or the absence of any Award Agreement provision relating to Dividend Equivalents, (a) no Dividend Equivalent with respect to any RSU shall be paid to a Grantee unless and until the RSU becomes vested and nonforfeitable, (b) a Grantee shall not have a vested and nonforfeitable right to any Dividend Equivalent with respect to an RSU unless and until the RSU becomes vested and nonforfeitable, and (c) a Grantee's right to any Dividend Equivalent with respect to any RSU shall be forfeited to the extent that the Grantee's right to the RSU is forfeited. 
(d) Voting Rights. A Grantee shall have the right to vote the Shares related to his or her Restricted Stock grant after the Date of Grant but before his or her interest in such Shares has been forfeited or has become nonforfeitable. A Grantee shall not have the right to vote the Shares related to his or her RSU grant until such time, if any, as the Shares are actually issued to the Grantee. 
(e) Satisfaction of Forfeiture Conditions. A Share related to a Restricted Stock Award shall cease to be Restricted Stock at such time as a Grantee's interest in such Share becomes nonforfeitable under the Plan, and the certificate representing such Share shall be reissued as soon as practicable thereafter without any further restrictions related to Section 8(c) or Section 8(d) and shall be transferred to the Grantee.

9. Other Stock-Based Awards. Subject to the terms of the Plan, including without limitation the minimum vesting provision in Section 5(c) of the Plan, the Committee may grant Other Stock-Based Awards to Employees or Consultants from time to time. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted in such amounts, on such terms and conditions, including without limitation terms and conditions relating to dividend (including Dividend Equivalent) and voting rights, and for such consideration, including no consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by Applicable Law, as the Committee determines in its discretion. The Grantee shall not receive any payment of any dividend or Dividend Equivalent with respect to the Award unless and not earlier than such time as the portion of the Award to which the dividend or Dividend Equivalent relates becomes vested and nonforfeitable, and the terms of the Award shall (subject to Section 21 and other applicable requirements of Code Section 409A) set forth the conditions, if any, under which the Grantee will be eligible to receive payment(s) of the dividend or Dividend Equivalent following the vesting of the applicable portion of the Award. If the terms of an Other Stock-Based Award calls for any such payments to be made, the Firm shall make such payments from the Firm's general assets, and the Grantee shall be no more than a general and unsecured creditor of the Firm with respect to such payments. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding any provision of an Award Agreement or the absence of any Award Agreement provision relating to dividends or Dividend Equivalents, (a) no dividend or Dividend Equivalent with respect to any Other Stock-Based Award shall be paid to a Grantee unless and until the portion of the Award to which the dividend or Dividend Equivalent relates becomes vested and nonforfeitable, (b) a Grantee shall not have a vested and nonforfeitable right to any dividend or Dividend Equivalent with respect to an Other Stock-Based Award unless and until the portion of the Award to which the dividend or Dividend Equivalent relates becomes vested and nonforfeitable, and (c) a Grantee's right to any dividend or Dividend Equivalent with respect to any Other Stock-Based Award shall be forfeited to the extent that the Grantee's right to the portion of the Award to which the dividend or Dividend Equivalent relates is forfeited. Without limitation, the terms and conditions applicable to an Other Stock-Based Award may include one, or more than one, objective time-based, performance-based, or other grant condition(s) that the Committee requires to be timely satisfied before the grant of the Other Stock-Based Award will be effective, and/or one, or more than one, objective time-based, performance-based, or other condition(s) that the Committee requires to be timely satisfied before the Other Stock-Based Award, or any portion or component of the Other Stock-Based Award, will be vested and nonforfeitable. Other Stock-Based Awards may be denominated in cash, in Shares or other securities, in units representing the rights to receive Shares, in securities or debentures convertible into Shares, or in any combination of the foregoing, and may be paid in Shares or other securities, in cash, or in a combination of Shares or other securities and cash, all as determined in the discretion of the Committee. No more than 500,000 Shares may be granted to an Employee in any calendar year under an Other Stock-Based Award that is denominated in Shares or units representing rights to receive Shares, and no more than 100,000 Shares may be granted to a Consultant (other than a non-Employee Director, who is subject to the Non-Employee Director Full Value Award Limit in Section 5(e) of the Plan) in any calendar year under an Other Stock-Based Award that is denominated in Shares or units representing rights to receive Shares. The maximum amount that a Grantee may earn by satisfaction of performance goals during any calendar year under Other Stock-Based Awards that are denominated in cash or any medium other than Shares or units representing rights to receive Shares is $7,500,000. For purposes of the limitation stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year in which the applicable performance goal(s) is satisfied is the calendar year in which the limitation applies, without regard to the duration of the Performance Period or any additional time-based vesting conditions or other terms or conditions relating to the payment of the Other Stock-Based Award.
10. Performance-Based Awards.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) In General. The Committee may grant Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Stock Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards that are Performance-Based Awards. On the Date of Grant of each Performance-Based Award, the Committee shall establish the Performance Period, the Performance Measure(s), and the Performance Goal(s) in respect of such Performance-Based Awards. Each Performance-Based Award shall provide that, in order for the Award to be granted or earned or for the Grantee to receive all or a portion of the Shares or cash subject to such Performance-Based Award, one or more specific Performance Goals must be attained over a designated Performance Period, with attainment of the Performance Goal(s) determined using specific Performance Measure(s). The Performance Goal(s), Performance Measure(s) and Performance Period shall be established by the Committee in its discretion. 
(b) Performance Goals. If a Stock Award or Other Stock-Based Award is subject to this Section 10, then the effectiveness of the grant of the Award, or the vesting and nonforfeitability of the Award, or both the effectiveness of the grant of the Award and the vesting and nonforfeitability of the Award shall be subject to satisfaction of one, or more than one, objective Performance Goals. The Committee shall, for the Performance Period applicable to the Award, establish the Performance Goal(s) based on the Performance Measure(s) selected by the Committee to apply to each Award and a formula or matrix prescribing the extent to which such Award shall be earned based upon the level of achievement of such Performance Goal(s). The Committee may establish different Performance Goals for different Grantees and different Awards. The Performance Goal(s) with respect to such Performance Measure(s) may be established at such levels and in such terms as the Committee may determine, in its discretion, including in absolute terms, as a goal relative to performance in prior periods, or as a goal compared to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies. The performance goals may be established in terms of Firm-wide objectives, objectives that are related to the performance of the individual Grantee or the Subsidiary, division, department, or function within the Firm or Subsidiary in which the Grantee is employed, or any other manner that the Committee determines appropriate in its discretion. Performance goals need not be based on audited financial results. 
[END TABLE]
57 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
[BEGIN TABLE]
(c) Adjustments and Procedure.  The Committee shall retain discretion to decrease the amount of the Award at any time through the date at which the Committee certifies the attainment of the Performance Goal(s), generally referred to as "negative discretion." The Committee may determine performance before payment of bonuses, capital charges, non-recurring income or expense, items of an unusual nature or of a type that indicates infrequency of occurrence, or other financial and general and administrative expenses for the Performance Period, and may measure the attainment of the Performance Goal by appropriately adjusting the evaluation of performance to exclude the effect of any changes in accounting principles affecting the Firm's or a business unit's reported results. The Committee may provide in the applicable Award Agreement additional rules and procedures relating to the Committee's ability to adjust aspects of a Performance-Based Award, the Committee's ability to increase or decrease the amount of compensation provided by a Performance-Based Award, and the Committee's certification or other determination of the extent to which Performance Goals have or have not been attained. 
[END TABLE]
11. Tax Withholding. The Firm shall deduct from all cash distributions under the Plan any taxes required to be withheld by federal, state, local or foreign government. Whenever the Firm proposes or is required to issue or transfer Shares under the Plan, the Firm shall have the right to require the recipient to remit to the Firm an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state, local and foreign withholding tax requirements prior to the delivery of shares. A Grantee may pay the withholding tax in cash, or a Grantee may elect to have the number of Shares he is to receive reduced by the appropriate number of whole Shares that, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Shares determined as of the Tax Date (defined below), is sufficient to satisfy up to the maximum applicable federal, state, local, and foreign tax withholding obligation arising from exercise, vesting, or payment of an Award as may be permitted under applicable accounting standards that would not result in the Award otherwise classified as an "equity" award under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC Topic 718") to be classified as a "liability" award under ASC Topic 718 as a result of the withholding of Shares with a Fair Market Value in excess of the minimum statutory tax withholding obligation (a "Withholding Election"). A Grantee may make a Withholding Election only if the Withholding Election is made on or prior to the date on which the amount of tax required to be withheld is determined (the "Tax Date") by executing and delivering to the Firm a properly completed notice of Withholding Election as prescribed by the Committee. The Committee may in its discretion disapprove and give no effect to the Withholding Election. 
12. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Change of Control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Firm, the number of Covered Stock, and the number of Shares of Common Stock that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Award, and the annual per-person limitations on Awards, as well as the price per share of Covered Stock and share-based performance conditions of Awards, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Firm; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Firm shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Firm of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Covered Stock. No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 12 in a manner that would cause Incentive Stock Options to violate Code Section 422(b) or cause an Award to be subject to adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. 
(b) Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, then the following provisions shall apply:  
(i) Vesting. The Board may, in the exercise of its discretion, accelerate the vesting and nonforfeitability of any Award that is outstanding on the date such Change in Control is determined to have occurred and that is not yet fully vested and nonforfeitable on such date.  
(ii) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Firm, to the extent that an Award is outstanding, it will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. The Board may, in the exercise of its discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or SAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Grantee the right to exercise his or her Option or SAR as to all or any part of the Covered Stock, including Shares as to which the Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  
[END TABLE]
58 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii) Merger or Asset Sale. Except as otherwise determined by the Board, in its discretion, prior to the occurrence of a merger of the Firm with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Firm, in the event of such a merger or sale each outstanding Option or SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right shall be substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or SAR or to substitute an equivalent option or right, the Board may, in the exercise of its discretion and in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Grantee to have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all or a portion of the Covered Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Option or SAR exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Committee shall notify the Grantee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a period of 30 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR will terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets and in a manner consistent with Code Sections 409A and 424, the option or right confers the right to purchase, for each Share of Covered Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Board may, with the consent of the successor corporation and the participant, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.  
(iv) Except as otherwise determined by the Board, in its discretion, prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control other than the dissolution or liquidation of the Firm, a merger of the Firm with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Firm, in the event of such a Change in Control, all outstanding Options and SARs, to the extent they are exercisable and vested, shall be terminated in exchange for a cash payment equal to an amount that does not exceed the Fair Market Value (reduced by the exercise price applicable to such Options or SARs). These cash proceeds shall be paid to the Grantee or, in the event of death of a Grantee prior to payment, to the estate of the Grantee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance.  
[END TABLE]
13. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective upon its approval by the shareholders of the Firm. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under applicable federal and state law. The Plan shall continue in effect until April 23, 2029, unless terminated earlier under Section 14 of the Plan. 
14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.  
(b) Shareholder Approval. The Firm shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 or with Section 422 of the Code (or any successor rule or statute) or other Applicable Law. Such shareholder approval, if required, shall be obtained in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the Applicable Law. Without the approval of shareholders, no amendment or alteration of the Plan or any outstanding Option or SAR will have the effect of amendment or replacing such an Option or SAR in a transaction that constitutes a "repricing."  For this purpose, a "repricing" means: (1) amendment the terms of an Option or SAR after it is granted to lower its exercise price or Base Price; (2) any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"); and (3) repurchasing for cash or canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its strike price is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying Stock, in exchange or substitution for another Option, SAR, Stock Award, Other Stock-Based Award, other equity, or cash or other property.  A cancellation and exchange or substitution described in clause (3) of the preceding sentence will be considered a repricing regardless of whether the Option, SAR, Stock Award, Other Stock-Based Award, other equity, or cash or other property is delivered simultaneously with the cancellation, regardless of whether it is treated as a repricing under GAAP, and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Grantee.  Adjustments of Awards under Section 12 will not be deemed "repricings," however.  The Committee shall have no authority to amend, alter, or modify any Award term after the Award has been granted to the extent that the effect is to waive a term that otherwise at that time would be mandatory for a new Award of the same type under the Plan. 
(c) Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Grantee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Grantee and the Committee, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Grantee and the Firm.  
[END TABLE]
15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Legal Compliance. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to an Award unless the exercise, if applicable, of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, Applicable Law, and the requirements of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Firm with respect to such compliance.  
[END TABLE]
59 Kforce 2019 Proxy Statement
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Firm may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Firm, such a representation is required.  
[END TABLE]
16. Liability of Firm. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Firm to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Firm's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Firm of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  
(b) Grants Exceeding Allotted Shares. If the Covered Stock covered by an Award exceeds, as of the date of grant, the number of Shares that may be issued under the Plan without additional shareholder approval, such Award shall be void with respect to such excess Covered Stock, unless shareholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of Shares subject to the Plan is timely obtained in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
17. Reservation of Shares. The Firm, during the term of the Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 
18. Rights of Employees and Consultants. Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Grantee any right with respect to continuing the Grantee's employment or consulting relationship with the Firm, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Grantee's right or the Firm's right to terminate such employment or consulting relationship at any time, with or without cause. 
19. Sub-plans for Foreign Subsidiaries. The Board may adopt sub-plans applicable to particular foreign Subsidiaries. All Awards granted under such sub-plans shall be treated as grants under the Plan. The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of the Plan, with the exception of Section 3, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan. 
20. Construction. The Plan shall be construed under the laws of the State of Florida, to the extent not preempted by federal law, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws. 
21. Certain Limitations on Awards to Ensure Compliance with Code Section 409A. For purposes of this Plan, references to an award term or event (including any authority or right of the Firm or a Grantee) being "permitted" under Code Section 409A mean, for a 409A Award (meaning an Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation under Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder), that the term or event will not cause the Grantee to be liable for payment of interest or a tax penalty under Code Section 409A and, for a Non-409A Award (meaning all Awards other than 409A Awards), that the term or event will not cause the Award to be treated as subject to Code Section 409A. Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the terms of any 409A Award and any Non-409A Award, including any authority of the Firm and rights of the Grantee with respect to the Award, shall be limited to those terms permitted under Code Section 409A, and any terms not permitted under Code Section 409A shall be automatically modified and limited to the extent necessary to conform with Code Section 409A. For this purpose, other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the Firm shall have no authority to accelerate distributions relating to 409A Awards in excess of the authority permitted under Code Section 409A, and any distribution subject to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) (separation from service) to a "specified employee" as defined under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall not occur earlier than the earliest time permitted under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i). The Firm may adopt a specified employee policy that will apply to identify the specified employees for all deferred compensation plans subject to Code Section 409A; otherwise, specified employees will be identified using the default standards contained in the regulations under Code Section 409A.

APPENDIX B
ADJUSTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The "Adjusted Financial Performance Measures" present non-GAAP financial information and should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented as an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results by adjusting for the impact of certain non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items in a manner that is focused on the performance of our underlying operations. Each of these measures are intended to provide greater consistency, comparability and clarity of our results. Management uses this non-GAAP financial information to assess the Company's core operating results and consequently, management believes it is similarly useful information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Firm did not have any non-GAAP adjustments.
