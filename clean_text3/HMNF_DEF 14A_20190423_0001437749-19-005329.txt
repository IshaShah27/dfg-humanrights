PROXY STATEMENT 
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation on behalf of the board of directors of HMN Financial, Inc. of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of stockholders, which will be held at the Rochester Golf and Country Club, located at 3100 W. Country Club Road, Rochester, Minnesota, on April 23, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., local time, and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. The accompanying notice of annual meeting and this proxy statement are expected to be mailed to stockholders on or about March 20, 2019.
Certain information provided herein relates to Home Federal Savings Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of our company referred to as "the bank."
The board of directors requests that you vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. You are invited to attend the meeting, but you do not need to attend the meeting to cast your vote. 
What is the purpose of the annual meeting? 
At the annual meeting, we will ask our stockholders to vote on four matters:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1.   Election of one member to our board of directors to serve until the conclusion of the first succeeding annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor has been duly elected and qualified and election of three members to our board of directors to serve until the conclusion of the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   3.   An advisory (non-binding) vote regarding the frequency of holding future Say-on-Pay votes; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   4.   Ratification of the appointment of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Following the formal portion of the meeting, our management will report on our performance and answer questions from our stockholders.
Who is entitled to vote on the proposals to be considered at the meeting and described in this proxy statement? 
Common stock is our only authorized and outstanding security entitled to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement at the annual meeting. In this proxy statement, when we refer to "stockholder," we are referring to our common stockholders, unless stated otherwise herein. Holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2019, the record date, will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock then held. As of March 1, 2019, we had 4,842,146 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The number of issued and outstanding shares excludes shares held in our treasury.
Who is entitled to attend the meeting? 
Subject to space availability, all stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. Since seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration will begin at 9:30 a.m. If you plan to attend the meeting, please note that you will be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices are not permitted at the meeting.
Please also note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a broker or other nominee), you will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date.
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of one third of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for purposes of the meeting. Abstentions and votes withheld will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
How do I vote? 
If you are a registered stockholder, proxies in the accompanying form that are properly signed and duly returned to us, voted by telephone or through the Internet in accordance with the voting instructions set forth below, and not revoked, will be voted in the manner specified.

[END TABLE]
If you are a registered stockholder and attend the annual meeting, you may deliver your proxy in person.
If you hold your shares in "street name," meaning you hold them through an account with a bank or broker, your ability to vote over the Internet or by telephone depends on your bank's or broker's voting procedures. Please follow the directions that your bank or broker provides.
All shares of our common stock represented at the meeting by properly executed proxies, duly delivered to our corporate secretary prior to or at the meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the instructions specified on the proxies.
What happens if I return my executed proxy without voting instructions? 
If no instructions are indicated, properly executed proxies will be voted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of each of the four nominated directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the advisory (non-binding) approval of the compensation of executives, as disclosed in this proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for a period of ONE YEAR for the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
As of the date of this proxy statement, the board does not know of any matters, other than those described in the notice of annual meeting and this proxy statement, that are to come before the meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the meeting for action, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will have, to the extent permitted by law, the discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.
May I revoke my proxy or change my vote? 
A proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked by filing with our corporate secretary, at or before the meeting, a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the date on the proxy. A vote may be changed by duly executing a proxy dated a later date than the earlier proxy and relating to the same shares and delivering it to our corporate secretary at or before the meeting. Attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy.
What is the recommendation of the board of directors on voting my shares? 
Our board of directors recommends a vote as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of each of the four nominated directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the advisory (non-binding) approval of the compensation of executives, as disclosed in this proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for a period of ONE YEAR for the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
If any other matters come up for a vote at the meeting, the proxy holders will vote in line with the recommendations of the board of directors or, if there is no recommendation, at their own discretion.
What vote is required to approve each item? 
If there is a quorum at the annual meeting, the matters to be voted upon by the stockholders require the following votes for such matter to be approved:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Election of Directors (Proposal 1). Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting. This means that since stockholders will be electing one director to serve a one-year term and three directors to serve three-year terms, the one nominee for a one-year term and the three nominees for three-year terms receiving the greatest number of votes cast by the common stockholders will be elected. For this purpose, a vote against one or more director nominees, a properly executed proxy marked abstain with respect to the election of director nominees or a broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the election of directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advisory Vote on Approval of Executive Compensation (a "Say-on-Pay" vote) (Proposal 2). We will consider the stockholders to have approved the compensation of our executive officers, on an advisory, non-binding basis, if this proposal receives the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the common stock for which votes are cast at the annual meeting. The advisory vote to approve the compensation of our executive officers is not binding on the board, but the compensation committee of the board will consider the vote of the stockholders when considering future executive compensation arrangements. A properly executed proxy marked abstain or a broker non-vote (discussed in more detail below) with respect to this proposal will not impact the outcome of this vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advisory Vote on Frequency of Future Say-on-Pay Votes (Proposal 3). The frequency that receives the highest number of votes cast at the annual meeting will constitute the non-binding advisory recommendation of the stockholders as to the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes. The advisory vote as to the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes is not binding on the board, but the compensation committee of the board will consider the vote of the stockholders when considering whether future Say-on-Pay votes should occur every one, two or three years. A properly marked abstain or a broker non-vote with respect to this proposal will not impact the outcome of this vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Proposal 4). The affirmative vote of holders of at least the majority of the common stock for which votes are cast at the annual meeting is required for ratification of the appointment of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. A properly executed proxy marked abstain with respect to this proposal will not impact the outcome of this vote.  
[END TABLE]
Generally, for all other items that properly come before the meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the common stock for which votes are cast at the annual meeting is required for approval. A properly executed proxy marked abstain or a broker non-vote with respect to any such item will not impact the outcome of the vote.
What is the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes? 
If stockholders indicate on their proxy that they wish to abstain from voting on a particular proposal, including brokers holding their customers' shares of record who cause abstentions to be recorded, these shares are considered present and entitled to vote at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but are not considered present or votes cast for purposes of calculating the vote with respect to that proposal. A proxy marked abstain on Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3 or Proposal 4 will not impact the outcome of those proposals.
Although our shares of common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, including those relating to the ability of brokers to vote on certain matters. If a stockholder does not give a broker holding the stockholder's shares instructions as to how to vote the shares, the broker has authority under New York Stock Exchange rules to vote those shares for or against "routine" matters that are not contested. For purposes of this proxy statement, the only "routine" matter is the ratification of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Brokers cannot vote on their customers' behalf on "non-routine" proposals. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have or does not exercise discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If a broker returns a "non-vote" proxy indicating a lack of authority to vote on a proposal, then the shares covered by such a "non-vote" proxy will be deemed present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but not present or a vote cast for purposes of calculating the vote with respect to that proposal. Therefore, broker non-votes will have no effect on any of the proposals to be voted upon by the stockholders.
May the meeting be adjourned? 
If a quorum is not present at the meeting, the chairman of the meeting, or the stockholders present, by vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote by stockholders that are present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the meeting. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
Who pays the expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies? 
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of common stock. In addition to solicitation by mail, our directors and officers, as well as employees of the bank, may solicit proxies personally or by telephone without additional compensation.
How may I obtain additional copies of the annual report? 
Our 2018 annual report, including financial statements, is enclosed. The annual report is also available online at www.hmnf.com or www.rdgir.com/hmn-financial-inc. For additional printed copies, which are available without charge, please send a written request to 1016 Civic Center Drive N.W., Rochester, Minnesota 55901, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
What is the deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal for the 2020 annual meeting? 
We must receive stockholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders that are requested to be included in the proxy statement for that meeting at our principal executive office no later than November 21, 2019. The inclusion of any stockholder proposals in the proxy materials will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including Rule 14a-8. We must receive any other stockholder proposals (including director nominations) intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders in writing at our principal executive office no later than 90 days in advance of the meeting (or if we do not publicly announce our annual meeting date 100 days in advance of the meeting date, by the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the meeting is mailed to stockholders or publicly made). We currently anticipate that our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will be held on or about April 28, 2020; therefore, we must receive notice of any business to be brought before that meeting by January 29, 2020. Written copies of all stockholder proposals should be sent to our principal executive offices at 1016 Civic Center Drive N.W., Rochester, Minnesota 55901, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or instruction form? 
This means that your shares are registered differently and are held in more than one account. To ensure that all shares are voted, please either vote each account over the Internet or by telephone, or sign and return by mail all proxy cards. We encourage you to register all of your shares in the same name and address by contacting our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, at 1-800-401-1957. If you hold your shares through an account with a bank or broker, you should contact your bank or broker and request consolidation.
I share an address with another stockholder, how can I change the number of copies of the proxy statement that we receive? 
Generally, we are sending only one copy of the proxy materials to eligible stockholders who share a single address unless we received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of proxy materials to any stockholder who requests one by contacting our corporate secretary by telephone at (507) 535-1205, or by mail to our principal executive offices at 1016 Civic Center Drive N.W., Rochester, Minnesota 55901, Attention: Corporate Secretary. If you are a registered stockholder residing at an address with another registered stockholder and you wish to receive a separate proxy in the future, or if the registered stockholders at that address currently are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and you wish to receive a single copy, you may contact our corporate secretary at the telephone number or address set forth above. If you are a stockholder whose shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you can request information about householding from your bank, broker or other nominee.
PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Background 
Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that the board of directors shall fix the number of directors from time to time. The size of the board has been set at nine members, subject to the power of the board to change the size of the board at any time. Proxies solicited by this proxy statement relate solely to nominees to our board for election by holders of our common stock and cannot be voted for more persons than the four nominees named below.
The board members to be elected by the holders of common stock are divided into three classes. The terms of three members of the board, Mr. Bue, Dr. Shannon and Mr. Zietlow, will expire at the conclusion of the annual meeting. The board has nominated Mr. Bue, Dr. Shannon and Mr. Zietlow, all of whom are current members of the board of directors, for election as directors to serve terms to expire at the conclusion of the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each to hold office following each nominee's election and qualification until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified. The board has also nominated Mr. Sequoya Borgman for election as a director to serve a term to expire at the conclusion of the first succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after his election, to hold office following his election and qualification until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. Mr. Borgman is not a current member of the board. The governance and nominating committee led the process for selecting the director nominee and recommending the selected nominee to the board. Based upon the composition and qualifications of the current board members, the governance and nominating committee focused on individuals who have a knowledge of the Milwaukee business market and audit committee qualifications. Mr. Borgman was initially identified by a non-employee director and subsequently interviewed by the governance and nominating committee and members of executive management.
It is intended that the proxies solicited on behalf of the board (other than proxies reflecting votes against or abstentions as to one or more nominees) will be voted at the meeting for the election of the nominees identified in this paragraph. If any nominee is unable to serve, the shares of common stock represented by all of these proxies will be voted for the election of a substitute as the board may recommend.
The board knows of no reason why any of the nominees, if elected, might be unable to serve. Except as described herein, there are no arrangements or understandings between any director or nominee and any other person pursuant to which the director or nominee was selected.
Selection of Director Nominees 
Director Qualifications. The board, acting through the governance and nominating committee, is responsible for selecting director nominees. The board and the governance and nominating committee believe that the board as a whole and its members individually should possess a combination of skills, professional experience, and business judgment necessary to oversee our company's current and future operations and represent stockholders' interests. The attributes that the board believes every director nominee should possess include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notable or significant business or public service achievement and experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• familiarity with, knowledge of, or experience in, the commercial banking industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• familiarity with, knowledge of, or experience in, managing risk;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the highest character and integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• knowledge and understanding of the business and social environment in the primary geographical areas in which we operate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an understanding of their obligation to represent the interests of all stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• freedom from conflicts of interest that would interfere with their ability to discharge their duties or that would violate any applicable laws or regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• capability of working in a collegial manner with persons of diverse educational, business and cultural backgrounds; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to devote the necessary time to discharge their duties, taking into account memberships on other boards and other responsibilities.  
[END TABLE]
Procedures Regarding Director Candidates Recommended by Stockholders. As set forth in its charter, the governance and nominating committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders if the recommended director candidate would be eligible to serve as a director under our by-laws. Our by-laws require that directors have their primary domicile in a county where the bank has a full service branch. This requirement may be waived by a majority of the board so long as a majority of the directors currently serving on the board have their primary domicile in a county where the bank has a full service branch. Our by-laws also require that each director must receive (or have been deemed to receive) any approval, waiver or non-objection required by the company's and the bank's federal regulators. This qualification requirement may be waived by a majority of the board in its sole discretion.
In order to be considered by the governance and nominating committee, a stockholder recommendation of a director candidate must set forth all information relating to the candidate that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including the potential director's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected).
The governance and nominating committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders in the same manner that it considers all director candidates. This consideration will include an assessment of each candidate's experience, integrity, competence, diversity, skills and dedication in the context of the needs of the board. Each candidate will be evaluated in the context of the board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group of nominees that can best perpetuate the success of the business and represent stockholder interest through the exercise of sound judgment based on a diversity of experience. None of the company's stockholders recommended candidates for the board of directors in connection with this annual meeting.
Rather than recommending director candidates to the governance and nominating committee, stockholders may directly nominate a person for election to the board by complying with the procedures set forth in our by-laws, any applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and any other applicable laws. For more information regarding the submission of stockholder nominations of director candidates, please refer to the section entitled "Stockholder Proposals," as well as the Q&A appearing at the beginning of this proxy statement.
Board Diversity. Neither the governance and nominating committee nor the board has a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. However, the governance and nominating committee considers diversity on the board in evaluating potential director nominees and believes that diverse perspectives are represented on the board, within the constraints of our by-law requirement that generally directors must have their primary domicile in a county where the bank has a full service branch.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, stockholders are being given the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation of our executives, as disclosed in this proxy statement, including the information presented under the heading "2018 Executive Compensation."
This is an advisory vote only, and neither the company nor our board of directors will be bound to take action based upon the outcome. While the vote is advisory, the compensation committee will consider the vote of the stockholders when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
We are presenting this proposal, which gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to vote to approve our executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement by voting for or against the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the company's named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other compensation tables and narrative disclosure."
The board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the approval of the compensation awarded to the executives, as disclosed in this proxy statement.
We currently hold our Say-on-Pay vote every year. Stockholders will have an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least every six years. An advisory vote regarding the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes is included as Proposal 3 for this annual meeting.
PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) APPROVAL REGARDING THE FREQUENCY OF HOLDING FUTURE SAY-ON-PAY VOTES 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act also requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, as to whether future Say-on-Pay votes should occur every one, two or three years. Currently our stockholders vote on the company's executive compensation every year. After careful consideration, the board is recommending that stockholders approve continuing to hold a Say-on-Pay vote every year.
The Board believes holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation is a best practice and is consistent with its policy of seeking regular input from stockholders on corporate governance matters and the company's executive compensation philosophy and practices. This vote is not binding but rather will provide the compensation committee with stockholders' views on how frequently they desire to consider executive compensation. Although the vote is advisory, the compensation committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering how frequently the company will submit executive compensation to a stockholder vote. Notwithstanding the outcome of the stockholder vote, the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with stockholders or the adoption of material changes to compensation programs.
The board recommends a vote for "ONE YEAR" as the preferred frequency for holding future Say-on-Pay votes.  
PROPOSAL 4 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Upon the recommendation of the audit committee, the board of directors has appointed CliftonLarsonAllen LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to be our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, subject to ratification by the stockholders. CliftonLarsonAllen LLP has audited the financial statements of our company and the bank since 2014. Representatives of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP are expected to attend the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement, if they so desire.
While it is not required to do so, the audit committee is submitting the appointment of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP for ratification in order to ascertain the view of the stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the audit committee will review the appointment.
The board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as our 2019 independent registered public accounting firm. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The board of directors is committed to its role in providing objective risk oversight of the company. The structure and responsibilities of the board's membership, leadership and committees is a critical aspect of our corporate governance to fulfill this role.
The company's corporate governance guidelines require that a substantial majority of the board be "independent directors," and the board believes its process of selecting and nominating a diverse membership with a combination of skills, professional experience and business judgment is an important element in accomplishing its risk oversight responsibility. The board does not have a policy on separating the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since it believes it should be free to make the choice from time to time that is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. While there is no policy, it is the current practice of the board to have the Chairman be an independent board member. Currently, Dr. Smith serves as the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Krehbiel serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company and the bank and as our director. The board believes this is the most appropriate structure for the company at this time and contributes to objective risk oversight because it makes use of Dr. Smith's experience on our board and his extensive understanding of corporate governance and risk oversight that he developed from his service on public company and non-profit boards of directors, while freeing Mr. Krehbiel to focus his energies on the operations of the company and the bank.
The chairs of board committees are selected by the full board based on their experience and expertise, including consideration of their understanding of the risk oversight associated with their respective committee. The board of directors and the audit, compensation and governance and nominating committees of the board coordinate with each other, through the leadership of Dr. Smith and the committee chairs, to provide enterprise-wide risk oversight of management and the company's operations. Our committees address risk-related matters during their meetings and the committee chairs regularly report to the full board on risk-related matters, providing the full board with integrated insight about our management of strategic, credit, interest rate, financial reporting, technology, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. In addition, our banking subsidiary has its own board of directors and audit, loan, information technology, compliance and asset/liability management committees whose responsibilities include risk management for the bank. The management and committees of our banking subsidiary also provide reports to our board of directors regarding activities related to risk management.
At meetings of the board of directors and its committees, directors receive regular updates from management regarding risk management. The chief financial officer, chief operating officer and other senior management of our banking subsidiary, who are responsible for instituting risk management practices that are consistent with our overall business strategy and risk tolerance, report directly to Mr. Krehbiel and lead management's risk discussions at board and committee meetings. Outside of formal meetings, the board, its committees and individual board members have full access to senior executives and management for, among other purposes, discussions of risks facing our company and the management of those risks.
Committees of the Board of Directors 
The board of directors has standing audit, compensation, executive and governance and nominating committees. The directors' current committee memberships are indicated in the following table:

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee. The audit committee oversees our financial reporting process by, among other things, recommending and taking action to oversee the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and selecting and appointing the independent registered public accounting firm. The board has determined that all members of the audit committee are independent as that term is defined in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards and regulations of the SEC and that all members are financially literate as required by the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. In addition, the board has determined that Mr. Nigon has the financial experience required by the applicable Nasdaq listing standards and is an audit committee financial expert as defined by applicable regulations of the SEC. The responsibilities of the audit committee are set forth in the audit committee charter, which is available on our website at www.hmnf.com. The audit committee reviews and reassesses its charter annually.
Compensation Committee. The compensation committee oversees and administers the compensation and benefits programs for executive officers and directors, including our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, and reviews and reports to the board on matters concerning compensation plans and the compensation of certain executives. The board has determined that all members of the compensation committee are independent as that term is defined in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. The responsibilities of the compensation committee are set forth in the compensation committee charter, which is available on our website at www.hmnf.com. The compensation committee reviews and reassesses its charter annually.
The compensation committee has the full authority to determine all elements of the compensation for Mr. Krehbiel and to approve all elements of the compensation of our other executive officers. In approving compensation actions for the other executive officers, the compensation committee receives regular input and recommendations from Mr. Krehbiel, and ascribes significant weight to his recommendations. Our chief financial officer and his staff, together with outside professionals, assist the compensation committee in evaluating the financial, accounting and tax treatment of existing and potential elements of our executive compensation program.
The compensation committee has the authority to retain independent compensation consultants to assist in the evaluation of executive officer compensation, and since 2010 has engaged Blanchard Consulting Group as its independent compensation consultant. Blanchard Consulting Group assists the compensation committee in refining the committee's compensation philosophy, defining characteristics of peer financial institutions and identifying particular peer group entities, compiling peer group compensation data, analyzing the elements of compensation, developing incentive compensation systems and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The compensation committee has assessed the independence of Blanchard Consulting Group pursuant to the rules of the SEC and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Blanchard Consulting Group from independently advising the compensation committee.
Executive Committee. The executive committee acts on issues arising between regular board meetings. The executive committee possesses the powers of the full board between meetings of the board.
Governance and Nominating Committee. The governance and nominating committee selects candidates as nominees for election as directors and advises and makes recommendations to the board on other matters concerning directorship and corporate governance practices, including succession plans for our executive officers. The board has determined that all members of the governance and nominating committee are independent as that term is defined in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. The responsibilities of the governance and nominating committee are set forth in the governance and nominating committee charter, which is available on our website at www.hmnf.com. The governance and nominating committee reviews and reassesses its charter annually.
Board and Committee Meetings 
The board held nine meetings during 2018. The audit committee held five meetings during 2018. The compensation committee held four meetings during 2018. The governance and nominating committee held seven meetings during 2018. The executive committee did not meet during 2018. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the board and all committees on which the director served, except Hans Zietlow attended 59% of such meetings.
Director Independence
The board has determined that none of our directors (except for Mr. Krehbiel, who is an employee of the bank) or director nominees have a material relationship with our company other than service as a director (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a material relationship with our company). Mr. Utz is the President and a stockholder of more than a 10% equity interest in Wendland Utz, which provided certain legal services to the company over the past few years. We concluded that the services provided by Mr. Utz did not impact his independence under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards due to the de minimis amount of fees paid by the company to Wendland Utz. As discussed in more detail under "Certain Transactions" below, certain of our directors have loans with the bank. The board concluded that such loans did not impact the independence of any of the directors or director nominees under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. Therefore, each of Messrs. Berning, Borgman, Bue, Nigon, Utz and Zietlow and Drs. Shannon and Smith is independent within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq listing standards.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all of our directors and employees, including our senior management and financial reporting employees. This code is available on our website at www.hmnf.com.
Stockholder Communication with the Board 
The board of directors provides a process for stockholders to send communications to the board or any of the directors. Stockholders may send written communications to the board or any of the directors c/o Chief Financial Officer, HMN Financial, Inc., 1016 Civic Center Drive N.W., Rochester, Minnesota 55901. All communications will be compiled by the Chief Financial Officer and submitted to the board or the individual directors on a periodic basis. Communications directed to the board in general will be forwarded to the appropriate director(s) to address the matter.
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, nine of our then-serving directors attended the annual meeting of stockholders.
Stockholder Proposals 
Under our by-laws, certain procedures are provided that a stockholder must follow to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate persons for election as directors. These procedures provide, generally, that stockholders desiring to bring a proper subject of business before the meeting, or to make nominations for directors, must do so by a written notice received by our corporate secretary, containing the name and address of the stockholder as they appear on our books and the class and number of shares owned by the stockholder, not later than 90 days in advance of the meeting (or if we do not publicly announce our annual meeting date 100 days in advance of the meeting date, by the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the meeting is mailed to stockholders or publicly made). If the notice relates to an item of business, it also must include a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting. Notice of an item of business shall include a brief description of the proposed business and a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of business by the stockholder and any material interest of the stockholder in the business. If the notice relates to a nomination for director, it must set forth the name and address of any nominee(s), any other information regarding each nominee as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC had each nominee been nominated by the board, and the consent of each nominee to be named in the proxy statement and to serve on the board.
The chairman of the meeting may refuse to allow the transaction of any business not presented, or to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made, in compliance with the foregoing procedures. Copies of our by-laws are available from our corporate secretary.
Related Person Transaction Approval Policy 
Our board of directors has adopted a written policy for related person transactions, which sets forth our policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of transactions subject to the policy with related persons who are subject to the policy. Our policy applies to any transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that have a financial aspect and in which we are a participant and a related person has a direct or indirect interest. Our policy, however, exempts the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our payment of compensation to a related person for that person's service to us in the capacities that give rise to the person's status as a "related person";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any extension of credit by our banking subsidiary in which a related person has a direct or indirect interest and which complies with the requirements of Regulation O under Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations and has been approved by either the board of directors of our banking subsidiary or its loan committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions, which when aggregated with the amount of all other transactions between the related person and our company, involve less than $120,000 in a fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
We consider the following people to be related persons under the policy:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The audit committee of our board of directors must approve any related person transaction subject to this policy before commencement of the related person transaction, except as otherwise provided below. The committee will analyze the following factors, in addition to any other factors the committee deems appropriate, in determining whether to approve a related person transaction:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms are fair to our company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction is material to our company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the role the related person has played in arranging the related person transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the structure of the related person transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the interests of all related persons in the related person transaction.  
[END TABLE]
The committee may, in its sole discretion, approve or deny any related person transaction. Approval of a related person transaction may be conditioned upon our company and the related person taking any actions that the committee deems appropriate.
If one of our executive officers becomes aware of a related person transaction that has not previously been approved under the policy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if the transaction is pending or ongoing, it will be submitted to the audit committee promptly and the committee will consider the transaction in light of the standards of approval listed above. Based on this evaluation, the committee will consider all options, including approval, ratification, amendment, denial or termination of the related person transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if the transaction is completed, the committee will evaluate the transaction in accordance with the same standards to determine whether rescission of the transaction is appropriate and feasible.  
[END TABLE]
There were no related person transactions in 2018 required to be reported in this proxy statement.

Approval of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Services and Fees
The audit committee pre-approved 100% of the services provided by CliftonLarsonAllen LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. CliftonLarsonAllen LLP provided no other services to the company, other than those noted above.
The audit committee's current practice on pre-approval of services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm is to approve annually all audit services and, on a case-by-case basis, recurring permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal year. The audit committee reviews each non-audit service to be provided and assesses the impact of the service on the registered public accounting firm's independence. In addition, the audit committee may pre-approve other non-audit services during the year on a case-by-case basis. Pursuant to a policy adopted by the audit committee, the chair of the audit committee is authorized to pre-approve certain limited non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Nigon, as the chair of the audit committee, did not pre-approve any non-audit services pursuant to this authority in 2018.
Report of the Audit Committee 
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed the company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and CliftonLarsonAllen LLP, the company's independent registered public accounting firm.  The audit committee has also discussed with CliftonLarsonAllen LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communication with Audit Committees".  The audit committee received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from CliftonLarsonAllen LLP required by the applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and discussed with CliftonLarsonAllen LLP its independence with respect to the company.  Based on the review and discussions with management and CliftonLarsonAllen LLP, the audit committee recommended to the board that the audited financial statements be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, to be filed with the SEC.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Our compensation program for non-employee directors is approved by the board based on recommendations from the compensation committee. All of our directors also serve as directors of our banking subsidiary. A director who is one of our employees receives no additional compensation for services as a director. During 2018, non-employee members of our board of directors were entitled to receive the following cash fees for their services to us and our banking subsidiary:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Description of Fees     
     Chairman of   			the Board       Non- employee Directors       Chairman of the Audit Committee        Other Committee Chairs    
     Chairman of   			the Board       Non- employee Directors       Chairman of the Audit Committee        Other Committee Chairs    
 Audit Committee attendance fee      —     $ 500     $ 1,500       —   
 Other board committee attendance fees      —     $ 300       —     $ 900   
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 schedule for cash fees payable to non-employee members of our board of directors did not change from our 2017 schedule. In aggregate there was no increase in the overall cash attendance and monthly retainer fees paid to the board in 2018 compared to the previous two years. Pursuant to our Director Stock Purchase Plan non-employee directors may elect to have some or all of their quarterly cash fees used by an agent selected by the company to purchase shares of the company's common stock in the stock market for their individual accounts.
In order to enhance alignment between directors and stockholders, each non-employee director receives on each of their first three annual meetings a restricted stock award under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. The number of shares to be awarded is determined by dividing $5,000 by the closing sale price of the company's common stock on the Nasdaq stock market on the date of grant. These shares vest on the day before the next annual meeting (or upon a change in control or the death or disability of the director), but remain non-transferable so long as the director recipient remains a member of our board of directors.
In accordance with the compensation program set forth above, our non-employee directors received the following total compensation for their service during 2018 on our board of directors:

   (1)   Pursuant to our Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, we allow directors to defer receipt of their fees until January 30 of the calendar year immediately following the date in which they cease to be a member of the board. We pay deferred fees yearly, over a period of ten years or less. Deferred fees earn interest at a rate equal to our bank subsidiary's cost of funds on November 30 of each year in which the fees are deferred.

   (2)   On April 24, 2018, each qualifying director was awarded a restricted stock award of 264 shares of the Company's stock based on the closing stock price of $18.90 on that date. The shares awarded will vest on April 22, 2019. The amounts shown in the "Stock Awards" column represent the grant date fair value of each of these awards computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on the closing stock price on the grant date. As of December 31, 2018, the number of unvested shares of restricted stock held by Mr. Bue and Mr. Zietlow was 264. None of the non-employee directors had stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
In July and August 2018, with assistance from our compensation consultant, a periodic assessment of our director compensation program was conducted which included benchmarking our program against those of our peers. As a result of this analysis the board, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, determined that beginning in April 2019 each non-employee director will annually receive a restricted stock award having an aggregate fair value of $4,000. The award will be awarded on the annual meeting date, will vest on the day before the next annual meeting and will remain non-transferable so long as the director recipient remains a member of our board of directors. In addition, in order to increase equity ownership by our board members, the board determined that for the first three years of board service, monthly and attendance fees will be paid 60% in cash and 40% in shares of our common stock.

Incentive Compensation Reflected in the Summary Compensation Table
Executive Management Incentive Plan. Our Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "EMI Plan") provides performance-based incentive compensation opportunities to executives designated by the compensation committee. Participants are eligible to earn payouts based on the degree to which pre-defined performance objectives established by the compensation committee have been achieved over the course of a calendar year performance period. The performance objectives are based on performance criteria approved by the compensation committee, such as net income, credit quality, return on equity, return on assets and performance against strategic objectives.
The EMI Plan provides that for any performance period, the company must achieve a minimum net income objective before any award will be paid under the EMI Plan, and must achieve a specified minimum credit quality objective before any portion of an award based on company-wide performance objectives may be paid. In addition, any EMI Plan participant must receive an individual performance rating of "meets expectations" or better for a performance period in order to be eligible for a payout. Provided these threshold performance requirements are satisfied, payout amounts will be determined based on the degree to which other pre-defined performance objectives, which may be company-wide, subsidiary, departmental or individual, have been achieved during the performance period. Incentive award opportunities for each EMI Plan participant will be established by the compensation committee for each performance period based on the participant's actual salary earned during the performance period.
A participant must be an active employee of the company or one of its subsidiaries on the award payout date in order to receive a payout, unless the participant terminates employment due to death or disability during the performance period (in which case, the participant may, at the compensation committee's discretion, receive a pro rata payout of the award otherwise earned during the performance period) or after the performance period is completed but prior to the payment date (in which case, the participant will be entitled to the full earned amount of the EMI Plan award).
The payout amount will be delivered following the end of the applicable performance period, usually in a combination of cash and equity awards, the ratio of which will be determined annually by the compensation committee. EMI Plan participants may, at the discretion of the compensation committee, elect for a greater portion of their awards to be paid in equity than the allocation prescribed by the compensation committee. The form of equity awarded may, at the discretion of the compensation committee, be selected by the participant. If the equity award is in the form of restricted stock, the number of shares of restricted stock awarded is determined by dividing the dollar value of the participant's equity award payout amount by the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant. If the equity award is in the form of stock options, the number of shares subject to each option awarded is determined by dividing the dollar value of the participant's equity award payout amount by the per share grant date fair value of the option determined in accordance with the Black-Scholes option valuation model. All equity awards vest in accordance with a schedule specified by the compensation committee. If a participant terminates employment during the vesting period, the participant will forfeit any unvested equity awards unless termination occurs due to death or disability, in which case all equity awarded under the EMI Plan will immediately vest. All equity awards will also immediately vest upon a change in control of the company, as defined in the company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan.
EMI Plan Payouts for 2018. For the 2018 performance period, the compensation committee approved a target incentive opportunity under the Plan of 25% of base salary for each of the NEOs, with threshold and maximum payouts equal to 12.5% and 45% of base salary, respectively. The dollar value of any payout was to be delivered 40% in cash and 60% in equity awards, subject to a participant's election to receive a greater percentage in equity awards. For 2018, all NEOs elected to receive 40% of their payout in the form of cash and 60% of their payout in the form of a restricted stock award. These restricted stock awards are scheduled to vest as to one-third of the shares subject to the award on each January 27 of the first three years following the grant date. Because both of the threshold performance requirements of achieving at least $3 million in net income and limiting classified assets to less than 25% of total assets were satisfied, application of the second-level performance objectives involving deposit growth, pre-tax earnings and individual objectives resulted in the following payouts to the NEOs:

As described above, in January 2019 all of our NEOs received restricted stock awards that were earned in 2018 and accordingly reported in the Summary Compensation Table for that year. These awards are not, however, reflected in the table above as they were not outstanding at December 31, 2018.
Other Compensation Arrangements
Benefits. Our NEOs participate on an equal, nondiscriminatory basis with all other employees in our medical insurance plan, medical reimbursement plan, childcare plan, long-term disability plan, group life insurance plan and 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan provides a 25% company match on employee contributions up to 8% of the employee's salary.
Our NEOs also participate on a nondiscriminatory basis in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"), in which all employees are eligible to participate after they complete one year of service. Shares held by the ESOP are allocated to eligible participant accounts based on the percentage relationship between the participant's compensation (subject to limits) and the aggregate compensation of all plan participants. The value of the ESOP contributions vary based on the price of our common stock and for 2018 represented between 3.8% and 5.0% of each NEO's base salary amount.
Because they have been employed by us since before September 2002, Messrs. Krehbiel and Eberle are also participants in a multi-employer comprehensive pension plan under which their benefits have been frozen since September 2002. At age 65, Mr. Krehbiel will be entitled to annual payments of $2,567, and Mr. Eberle will be entitled to annual payments of $4,141.
Severance Agreement with Mr. Krehbiel. In May 2017, we entered into an executive severance agreement with Mr. Krehbiel. The severance agreement has a one year term and will be automatically extended for one year renewal terms unless either party provides notice of non-renewal to the other party at least 60 days prior to any automatic renewal date.
The severance agreement provides that if Mr. Krehbiel's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause (and other than as a result of his death or disability), or if he resigns for "good reason" (either event referred to as a "Qualifying Termination"), in either case on the date of a change in control or within two years thereafter, then he will be entitled to receive lump sum cash payments equal to (i) two times the sum of his annualized base salary as of the termination date and his target annual incentive bonus for the calendar year in which the employment termination date occurs, (ii) 24 times the monthly amount that the company or the bank then pays as its share of the premiums for coverage for Mr. Krehbiel and his eligible spouse and dependents under the company's or bank's health and dental insurance plans, and (ii) 24 times the monthly amount the company or the bank then pays for its share of the premiums for life and disability insurance coverage for Mr. Krehbiel under the company's or the bank's then current plans.
The severance agreement also provides that if Mr. Krehbiel experiences a Qualifying Termination other than on the date of or within two years after a change in control, then he will be entitled to receive the following severance payments and benefits: (i) payment of an amount equal to one and one-half times the sum of his annualized base salary as of the termination date and his target annual incentive bonus for the calendar year in which the employment termination date occurs, payable in substantially equal installments in accordance with the company's regular payroll practices over the 18 month period following the termination date; (ii) if he elects COBRA continuation coverage under the company's or the bank's health and dental insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents, payment of the employer portion of the premiums for such coverage for 18 months or until he becomes eligible for health insurance coverage from another employer, (iii) a lump sum payment equal to 18 times the monthly amount the company or the bank then pays for its share of the premiums for life and disability insurance coverage for Mr. Krehbiel under the company's or the bank's then current plans, and (iv) accelerated vesting of any equity incentive award to Mr. Krehbiel that is outstanding under a company equity-based compensation plan as of the termination date.
Payment of any and all severance benefits under the severance agreement is conditioned upon Mr. Krehbiel first signing and not rescinding a release of claims against the company and the bank, and remaining in compliance, during his period of employment and for 18 months after a Qualifying Termination, with his obligations not to compete with the company or the bank, not to hire or attempt to hire away from the company or the bank any employee of the company or the bank, and not to solicit, induce or attempt to induce any customer, vendor or supplier of the company or the bank to cease doing business with either.
For purposes of the severance agreement, a "change in control" is defined in the same manner as in the company's 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, and generally occurs if (i) a third-party acquires or becomes the beneficial owner of 35% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or the bank (other than in an acquisition of voting securities directly from the company or the bank); (ii) a majority of the members of the company's board are replaced as a result of an actual or threatened election contest; (iii) a merger or consolidation involving the company or the bank, or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company or the bank, is consummated that changes ownership of the company or the bank by 35% or more; or (iv) the company's stockholders approve a complete liquidation or dissolution of the company or the bank.
The severance agreement provides that "good reason" for a resignation generally occurs if there is a material diminution in Mr. Krehbiel's authority, duties, responsibilities or base salary or in the budget over which he retains authority, there is a requirement that he report to an officer of the company or the bank rather than to the board of the company or the bank, his principal place of employment is relocated more than 35 miles from its current location, or there occurs a material breach by the company or bank of the Agreement or any other agreement then in effect with Mr. Krehbiel. Good reason for termination will not, however, exist if he fails to notify the company within 90 days of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or if the company cures any such event within 30 days of the receipt of such notice.
The amounts payable pursuant to the severance agreement will, if necessary, be reduced to the largest aggregate amount that will result in no portion of such payments, when aggregated with other compensation that is deemed contingent on a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or the Bank, being considered a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, any amount otherwise payable under the severance agreement may be paid only if such payment is then permitted under the "golden parachute regulations" adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Change in Control Agreements with Messrs. Eberle and McGraw. In May 2014, we entered into change in control agreements with Messrs. Eberle and McGraw. The change in control agreements provide that if an executive's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause (and other than as a result of the executive's death or disability), or if the executive voluntarily terminates his employment for "good reason," in either case after the company or bank enters into a letter of intent or agreement relating to a change in control that ultimately occurs, after a tender offer, exchange offer or proxy contest is commenced that results in a change of control, or within two years after a change in control, then the executive will be entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the executive's annualized base salary as of the termination date and his target annual cash incentive bonus for the calendar year in which the employment termination date occurs. The agreements also provide for lump sum payments equal to (i) 24 times the monthly amount that the company or the bank then pays as its share of the premiums for single employee coverage under the company's or bank's health insurance plan and (ii) the amount the company or the bank would otherwise expect to expend for its share of the premiums for 24 months of life and disability insurance coverage for an employee under the company's or the bank's then current plans.
Payment of the severance benefits under the change in control agreements is conditioned upon the executive first signing and not rescinding a release of claims against the company. Severance benefits will be paid in a lump sum no later than 75 days after termination of employment or consummation of the change in control, as applicable. A "change in control" is defined as set forth above.
"Good reason" for a voluntary termination generally occurs under the agreements if (i) there is a material diminution in an executive's authority, duties, responsibilities or base salary or in the budget over which the executive retains authority, (ii) there is a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the executive reports, (iii) the executive's principal place of employment is relocated more than 35 miles from its current location, or (iv) any other action or inaction by the company or the bank constitutes a material breach of the change in control agreement or any other agreement between such entity and the executive. Good reason for termination will not, however, exist if the executive fails to notify the company within 90 days of the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or if the company cures any such event within 30 days of the receipt of such notice.
The amounts payable pursuant to the change in control agreements will, if necessary, be reduced to the largest aggregate amount that will result in no portion of such payments, when aggregated with other compensation that is deemed contingent on a change in ownership or effective control of the company or the bank, being considered a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, any amount otherwise payable under a change in control agreement may be paid only if such payment is then permitted under the "golden parachute regulations" adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
