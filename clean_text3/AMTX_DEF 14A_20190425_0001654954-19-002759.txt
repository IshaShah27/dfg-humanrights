    Q:      If I sign a proxy, how will it be voted?  
  A:  
 When proxies are properly delivered, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. However, if no specific instructions are given, the shares will be voted in accordance with the above recommendations of our Board of Directors. If any matters not described in the proxy statement are properly presented at the
 Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned, the proxy holders can vote your shares on the new meeting date as well, unless you have revoked your proxy instructions, as described below under "Can I change my vote?" 
    Q:      What should I do if I get more than one set of voting  materials?  
  A:  
 Stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple Internet Availability Notices or voting instruction cards. For example, stockholders who hold shares in more than one brokerage account may receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which shares are held. Stockholders of record whose shares are registered in more than one name will receive more than one Internet Availability
 Notice. You should vote in accordance with the instructions in each
 Internet Availability Notice and voting instruction card you receive relating to our Annual Meeting to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 "legal proxy" from the record holder of the shares giving you the right to vote the shares.

    Q:  
 What are "broker non-votes?" 
   A:  
 A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and has not received voting instructions from its clients. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will only have discretion to vote your shares on
 "routine" matters. Where a proposal is not "routine," a broker who has not received instructions from its clients does not have discretion to vote its clients' uninstructed shares on that proposal. At our Annual Meeting, the Company believes that only
 Proposal No. 4 (ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine item.
 This means that brokers may vote in their discretion on this matter on behalf of clients who have not furnished voting instructions.
 Brokers who have not been furnished voting instructions from their clients will not be authorized to vote in their discretion on the
 "non-routine" matter found in Proposals No. 1, 2 and 3.
 Accordingly, for beneficial stockholders, if you do not give your broker specific instructions, your shares may not be voted on such proposal.

    Q:  
 How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted? 
  A:  
 Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and will be counted for purposes of determining whether proposals requiring approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Thus, an abstention or broker non-vote will have no effect on Proposal 1 and an abstention will be counted as a vote "AGAINST" Proposals 2, 3 and
 4.

    Q:      What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A:  
 For purposes of our Annual Meeting, a "quorum" is the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company, which includes shares of common stock and preferred stock (with the preferred stock being counted on an as-converted-to-common stock basis), represented in person or by proxy at the meeting. If you have returned valid proxy instructions or attend the Annual Meeting in person, your stock will be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you wish to abstain from voting on some or all matters at the meeting. All shares of Aemetis common stock and preferred stock
 (with the preferred stock being counted on an as converted to common stock basis) represented at the Annual Meeting, including broker non-votes and abstentions, will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for our Annual Meeting to be held.

    Q:      How are votes counted?      
  A:      Aemetis will designate Issuer Direct as the Inspector of Election  who will tabulate the votes. The Inspector of Election will  separately count "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes,  abstentions and broker non-votes.      
    Q:  
 Who is making this solicitation? 
  A:  
 This proxy is being solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of Aemetis. 
    Q:      Who pays for the proxy solicitation process?      
  A:  
 Aemetis will pay the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, distributing and making available these proxy materials and soliciting votes. We do not plan to retain a proxy solicitor to assist with the solicitation. We may, on request, reimburse brokerage firms and other nominees for their expenses in forwarding or making available proxy materials to beneficial owners. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, we expect that our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in person, by phone or by other electronic means. None of these individuals will receive any additional or special compensation for doing this, although we will reimburse these individuals for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

    Q:      May I propose actions for consideration at next year's annual  meeting of stockholders or nominate individuals to serve as  directors?      
  A:  
You may present proposals for action at a future meeting only if you comply with the requirements of the proxy rules established by the SEC. In order for a stockholder proposal to be included in our Proxy Statement and form of Proxy relating to the meeting for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders under Rule 14a-8 adopted under Section 14(a) of Securities Exchange
 Act of 1934, as amended (the "Securities Exchange
 Act"), the proposal must be received by us no later than 5:00
 p.m. (Pacific Time) on the 90th day, and not earlier than on the
 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the mailing of the notice for the preceding year's annual meeting. Accordingly, stockholder proposals intended to be presented in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by Todd
 Waltz, the Company's Corporate Secretary, on or after
 November 15, 2019, and prior to 5:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on December 15,
 2019 and must satisfy the requirements of the proxy rules promulgated by the SEC. If our 2020 Annual Meeting of
 Stockholders is not held within 30 days of April 25, 2020, we will publicly announce a different submission deadline from that set forth above, in compliance with SEC rules. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of our 2020 Annual Meeting of
 Stockholders will not trigger a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this proxy statement. 
    Q:      How do I obtain a separate set of proxy materials or request a  single set for my household?  
  A:

The Board of Directors is presently composed of five (5) members: Eric A. McAfee, Francis Barton, Lydia I. Beebe, John Block and Steven Hutcheson. Mr. McAfee serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. There are no family relationships between any director and executive officer.
The Board of Directors held six (6) meetings during fiscal year 2018 and acted by written consent on three (3) occasions. Each director attended all of the meetings of our Board of Directors and of the committees on which each director served, as applicable, during fiscal year 2018 and was eligible to attend. The Board encourages the directors to attend the annual meetings of stockholders.
 BOARD INDEPENDENCE
 The Board of Directors has determined that all of its current directors except Eric A. McAfee, who currently serves as Aemetis' Chief Executive Officer, are independent directors within the meaning set forth in the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, as currently in effect.
 BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
Our Board retains flexibility to select its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in the manner that it believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer may be filled by one individual or two. The Board currently believes that having Mr. McAfee serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board is in the best interests of the stockholders given Mr. McAfee's extensive knowledge of, years of service to and experience with, the Company. The Board has designated Francis Barton as Lead Independent Director, to preside over the Board's Executive Sessions and fulfill other duties.
 Both the full Board and its committees oversee the various risks faced by the Company. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company's risks and provides periodic reports to the Board and its committees relating to those risks and risk-mitigation efforts.
 Board oversight of risk is conducted primarily through the standing committees of the Board, the members of which are independent directors, with the Audit Committee taking a lead role on oversight of financial risks and in interfacing with management on significant risks or exposures and assessing the steps management has taken to minimize such risks. The Audit Committee is also charged with, among other tasks, oversight of management on the Company's guidelines and policies with respect to risk monitoring, assessment and management. Members of the Company's management periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding risks overseen by the Audit Committee, including quarterly reports with respect to the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.
Set forth below is information regarding our directors as of March 14, 2019, the class under which each director serves and, assuming the reelection of the director nominees at the Annual Meeting, the expiration of the term of such director:

Each current member of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee is an independent director within the meaning set forth in the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ, as currently in effect, including after giving consideration to the factors specified in the NASDAQ listing rules for compensation committee independence.
The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee considers properly submitted stockholder recommendations for candidates for membership on the Board as described below under "Identification and Evaluation of Nominees for Directors." In evaluating such recommendations, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and to address the membership criteria set forth under "Director Qualifications" below. Any stockholder recommendations proposed for consideration by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee should include the candidate's name and qualifications for membership on the Board and should be addressed to the attention of our Corporate Secretary — Re: Stockholder Director Recommendation, at 20400 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 700, Cupertino, CA 95014.
 Director Qualifications
The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee does not have any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by a Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee-recommended nominee, but uses a variety of criteria to evaluate the qualifications and skills necessary for members of our Board, including capability, availability to serve, diversity, independence and other factors. Under these criteria, members of the Board should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values. A director should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education, technology or public interest. A director should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out his or her duties, and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on his or her past experience. A director's service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permit him or her, given individual circumstances, to perform the director duties responsibly. Each director must represent the interests of Aemetis stockholders.
 Identification and Evaluation of Nominees for Directors
The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee considers various potential candidates for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee through current members of the Board, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. These candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee, and may be considered at any point during the year. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee considers properly submitted stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board. In evaluating such recommendations, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee uses the qualifications standards discussed above and seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board.
A copy of the Committee's written charter is available on the Governance page of the Investor Relations section of our website at www.aemetis.com. In fiscal year 2018, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee held five (5) meetings. Each director who is a member of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee attended all of the meetings of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee during fiscal year 2018.  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to our directors and all of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and any other principal financial officer, Controller and any other principal accounting officer, and any other person performing similar functions. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on the Governance page of the Investor Relations section of our website at www.aemetis.com. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics addresses, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code.

 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 The Board of Directors currently consists of five (5) directors classified into three separate classes, consisting of two (2) directors in two classes, and one (1) in the third class, with one class being elected each year to serve a staggered three-year term. Under the current Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, elections of one class of directors are held at each annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly qualified and elected or such earlier date of resignation or removal. Following the Annual Meeting, the terms of office of the Class I, Class II and Class III directors will expire in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 NOMINEES
 The Board of Directors approved Eric McAfee and Francis Barton as nominees for election to the Board as the Class I directors at the Annual Meeting. If elected, Eric McAfee and Francis Barton will serve as Class I directors for a three-year term expiring in 2022. The nominees are currently directors of the Company. Please see above for information concerning our incumbent directors' standings for re-election.
 Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them FOR the nominees set forth above. If any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for another nominee designated by the Board of Directors. We are not aware of any reason that either nominee would be unable or unwilling to serve as a director.
 VOTE REQUIRED
 If a quorum is present, the nominee receiving the highest number of votes will be elected to the Board. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors. Proxies may not be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.
 BOARD RECOMMENDATION
 THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL TWO:
 ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC enable stockholders of certain public companies to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of named executive officers.
As described in detail below under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Please read "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below and the accompanying tables and footnotes for additional details about our executive compensation program.
The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that it has taken a responsible approach to executive compensation that allows the Company to retain its executive talent while remaining committed to our core compensation philosophy of paying for performance while aligning executive compensation with stockholder interests. In particular, during fiscal year 2018 the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee:
 issued time-based stock option awards to certain of our named executive officers to reward long-term strategic management and foster the enhancement and improvement of stockholder value;
 approved discretionary bonuses for certain of our named executive officers in recognition of their service and contribution to the profitability of the Company during 2018; and
 reviewed and left unchanged the base salary for our named executive officers for 2018.
Based on the foregoing, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that its treatment of named executive officer compensation for fiscal year 2018 continues to be in line with the long-term interests and prospects of the Company. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that the Company's named executive officers are best incentivized by a compensation plan weighted towards base compensation and equity grants issued by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee further believes Mr. McAfee, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, is adequately compensated through a combination of his base pay and his current equity position such that additional equity awards to him were not warranted during 2018.
The Board believes the Company's executive compensation program is well tailored to retain key executives while recognizing and continuing to align it with stockholder interests.
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officers' compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, program and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the Annual Meeting pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion pursuant thereto.
 VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal No. 2 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as votes "AGAINST" this proposal.
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee or our Board. Our Board and our Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officers' compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee will evaluate whether any actions are appropriate to address those concerns.
 BOARD RECOMMENDATION
 THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROPOSAL NO. 2.  PROPOSAL THREE:
 APPROVAL OF THE AEMETIS, INC. 2019 STOCK PLAN
The Board is requesting that the stockholders approve the adoption of the Aemetis, Inc. 2019 Stock Plan (the "2019 Stock Plan"), which was approved in the form attached hereto as Appendix I by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board as of February 21, 2019, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting.
If approved by our stockholders, the 2019 Stock Plan will become effective as of the date of approval. If our stockholders do not approve the 2019 Stock Plan on or before February 21, 2020, the 2019 Stock Plan will automatically terminate and will be of no force and effect to the same extent and with the same effect as though the 2019 Stock Plan had never been adopted.
 Reasons for the Adoption of the 2019 Stock Plan
We strongly believe that the approval of the 2019 Stock Plan is essential to our continued success. Our Board believes that equity awards motivate high levels of performance, align the interests of employees and stockholders by giving employees the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the Company, and provide an effective means of recognizing employee contributions to the success of the Company. Our Board believes that equity awards are a competitive necessity in the environment in which we operate, and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified technical and other key personnel who help the Company meet its goals, as well as rewarding and encouraging current employees and service providers. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that the ability to grant equity awards will be important to the future success of the Company.
In the past, we have granted stock options pursuant to our 2007 Stock Plan (as amended and restated from time to time, the "2007 Stock Plan"), which, upon approval of the 2019 Stock Plan, will no longer be active. Additionally, on July 1, 2011, we acquired the Zymetis 2006 Stock Plan (the "2006 Stock Plan") pursuant to our acquisition of Zymetis, Inc. and gave Zymetis, Inc. option holders the right to convert shares of Zymetis, Inc. into our common stock pursuant to the same terms as under the 2006 Stock Plan.
If approved, the 2019 Stock Plan shall be treated as a successor to the 2007 Stock Plan and the 2006 Stock Plan (each, a "Prior Plan"). Any award granted under a Prior Plan shall remain subject to the terms of the applicable award document and the Prior Plan under which such award was granted, including, for purposes of the transition relief afforded by Section 13601(e)(2) of the Tax Act, the terms of the applicable award document and the Prior Plan that were intended to satisfy the applicable performance-based exceptions to Code Section 162(m). The 2019 Stock Plan is similar to the 2007 Stock Plan, with the exception of:
 Increasing the number of shares automatically added annually to the shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan, if approved, to the lesser of (i) four percent (4%) of the sum of (A) the number of shares outstanding on the date that the 2019 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board plus (B) the number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans on the date that the 2019 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board, or (ii) such number as determined by the Board. The existing 2007 Stock Plan provides that the number of shares automatically added annually to the shares reserved for issuance thereunder is the lesser of (i) three percent (3%) of the sum of (A) the number of shares outstanding on the date that the 2007 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board plus (B) the number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding awards on the date that the 2007 Stock Plan was adopted by the Board, or (ii) such number as determined by the Board.
 Updating provisions surrounding performance-based awards pursuant to Code Section 162(m) that are no longer applicable following the implementation of the Tax Act and other provisions to reflect the current "best-practices" with respect to equity-based compensation.
As of immediately prior to the approval of the 2019 Stock Plan by the Board, only 196,780 shares remained available for future issuance under the 2007 Stock Plan. The purpose of the increase in the number of shares automatically added to the shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan each year is to secure adequate shares to fund expected awards. The Board believes that this automatic increase in the number of shares added to the shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan each year represents a source of reasonable amount of potential equity dilution and allows us to continue awarding equity incentives, which are an important component of our overall compensation program. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends approval of the 2019 Stock Plan because it believes strongly in encouraging selected employees, consultants, and directors to acquire a proprietary interest in our growth and performance, thus enhancing the value of our company for the benefit of our stockholders.  New Plan Benefits
All awards to directors, executive officers, employees and consultants are made at the discretion of the Administrator of the 2019 Stock Plan. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the 2019 Stock Plan are not determinable at this time. The following table is for illustrative purposes only and provides certain summary information concerning equity awards made in fiscal year 2018.

 Summary of Material Features of the 2019 Stock Plan
Administration.  The 2019 Stock Plan is administered by the Board or any of its committees.
Term.  The 2019 Stock Plan shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years following its adoption by the Board, except with respect to awards issued thereunder then outstanding.  In general, the term of each option granted shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant, though in certain instances such term may be shorter. Eligibility.  Employees and service providers of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Stock Plan.  There are approximately 54 employees and four non-employee directors currently eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Stock Plan.  The number of other service providers potentially eligible to participate in the 2019 Stock Plan is not currently determinable.
Awards.  Awards under the 2019 Stock Plan may include grants of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares, and other stock or cash awards as the Administrator (as defined in the 2019 Stock Plan) may determine.  Eligibility for any particular award is determined by the Administrator and, in the case of awards of incentive stock options, eligibility for receipt of such awards may be limited by the Internal Revenue Code.  The terms and conditions of each award, including the vesting schedule, shall be determined by the Administrator at the time of grant.
Award Limits.  Awards under the 2019 Stock Plan are subject to the following limits:
Plan Limits.  The Company has reserved 200,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan.  As of March 12, 2019, the value of a share of our common stock was $0.90.  Shares available for issuances under the plan will be increased each year in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) four percent (4%) of the sum of (A) the number of shares outstanding on the date that the 2019 Stock Plan was adopted by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee plus (B) the number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans on the date that the 2019 Stock Plan was adopted by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee, or (ii) such number as determined by the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee.
Individual Limits.  The Administrator shall have complete discretion in determining the number of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares granted to any participant.
Each of the above limits is subject to adjustment for certain changes in the Company's capitalization such as stock dividends, stock splits, combinations or similar events.  If an award expires, terminates, is forfeited or is settled in cash rather than in shares of common stock, the shares of common stock not issued under that award will again become available for grant under the 2019 Stock Plan.  If shares of common stock are surrendered to the Company or withheld to pay any exercise price or tax withholding requirements, only the number of shares of common stock issued net of the shares withheld or surrendered will be counted against the number of shares of common stock available under the 2019 Stock Plan.  The exercise price for a stock option or stock appreciation right may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant or may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant for employees representing more than 10% of the voting power of all of the classes of stock of the Company.  The Board may amend, alter, suspend or terminate the plan.  The Board shall obtain stockholder approval of any plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable law.
 Certain U.S. Federal Tax Consequences
The following is a brief summary of the principal federal income tax consequences of awards under the 2019 Stock Plan to U.S. taxpayers and the Company based on applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations now in effect.
The following discussion assumes that the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise is greater than the per share exercise price.
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  No taxable income is reportable when a nonstatutory stock option with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant is granted to a participant.  Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on the exercise date) of the shares purchased over the exercise price of the option.  Any taxable income recognized in connection with an exercise of the nonstatutory stock option by an employee of the Company is subject to tax withholding by the Company.  Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss. Incentive Stock Options.  No taxable income is reportable when an incentive stock option is granted or exercised (except for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, in which case taxation is the same as for nonstatutory stock options).  If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares more than two years after the grant date and more than one year after the exercise date, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss.  If the participant exercises the option and then later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares before the end of the two- or one-year holding periods described above, he or she generally will recognize ordinary income at the time of the sale equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise price of the option.
Stock Appreciation Rights.  Generally, no taxable income is reportable when a participant is granted a stock appreciation right.  Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any shares received in excess of the exercise price.  Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss.
Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units.  A participant generally will not have taxable income at the time an award of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, or performance units are granted.  Instead, he or she will recognize ordinary income in the first taxable year in which his or her interest in the shares underlying the award becomes either (i) freely transferable, or (ii) no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  However, the recipient of an award of restricted stock may elect to recognize income at the time he or she receives the award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares underlying the award (less any cash paid for the shares on the date the award is granted). Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be capital gain or loss.
Tax Effect for the Company.  The Company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2019 Stock Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option).
 THE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION UPON PARTICIPANTS AND THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE GRANT AND EXERCISE OF AWARDS UNDER THE 2019 STOCK PLAN.  IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE, AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF A PARTICIPANT'S DEATH OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX LAWS OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE OR FOREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANT MAY RESIDE.
 VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as votes "AGAINST" this proposal.
 RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD
 THE BOARD RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE 2019 STOCK PLAN.  PROPOSAL FOUR:
 RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS
The Board has selected RSM US LLP as the Company's independent auditors, to audit the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019. The Board recommends that stockholders vote for ratification of such appointment. Although ratification by stockholders is neither required by law nor binding on the Board, the Board has determined that it is desirable to request ratification of this selection by the stockholders. Notwithstanding the selection, the Board, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of new independent auditors at any time during the year if the Board feels that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and it stockholders. In the event of a negative vote on ratification, the Board will reconsider its selection. The aggregate fees billed for services rendered by RSM US LLP during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are described below under the caption "Principal Accountant Fees and Services."

Audit-Related Fees consist of assistance provided with respect to the Form S-8 and comfort letter prepared in connection with the 2019 Stock Plan.
 Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Consistent with policies of the SEC regarding auditor independence and the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee has the responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the registered independent public accounting firm (the "Firm"). The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Firm. Pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service to category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis. In assessing request for services by the Firm, the Audit Committee considers whether such services are consistent with the Firm's independence, whether the Firm is likely to provide the most effective and efficient service based upon their familiarity with the Company, and whether the service could enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality.
In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, all fees identified above under the captions "Audit Fees" and "Audit-Related Fees" that were billed by RSM US LLP were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with SEC requirements.
 VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal No. 4 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as votes "AGAINST" this proposal.

 EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
We are party to the following agreements with our named executive officers:
 Eric A. McAfee
Effective September 1, 2011, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. McAfee in connection with his continuing responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. McAfee's employment agreement, he originally received an annual salary of $180,000 per year, subject to annual review and adjustments. Effective January 1, 2017, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee approved an increase in his annual salary from $250,000 per year to $310,000 per year. In addition, Mr. McAfee is entitled to an annual cash bonus in an amount determined by the Board of Directors based upon attainment of certain performance milestones as determined by the Board from time to time. For 2018, the annual bonus for Mr. McAfee was determined by taking into consideration the profitability of future operations, likelihood of future success of the company, and executive leadership participation qualities, adjusted by the impact of external policy, political and economic events as positive or negative influences on the amount of difficulty required to execute on the business plan. This amount was then scaled to $40,000 to reflect the amount of cash available for executive bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year. The initial term of Mr. McAfee's employment agreement was for three years with automatic one-year renewals thereafter, unless terminated by either party on sixty days' notice prior to the end of the then-current period.
If, prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement), Mr. McAfee is terminated other than for Cause (as defined in the agreement) or as a result of his death or Total Disability (as defined in the agreement) or is Constructively Terminated (as defined in the agreement), then provided he signs a release of claims, Mr. McAfee is entitled to receive severance benefits of (i) cash payments equal to his then-current base salary for a period of six (6) months payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices, and (ii) company-paid health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for him and his dependents until the earlier of six (6) months following the date of termination or until such time as Mr. McAfee is covered under another employer's group policy for such benefits. If, on or following a Change in Control, Mr. McAfee's employment is Constructively Terminated or involuntarily terminated other than for Cause, death or Total Disability, then provided he signs a release of claims, in addition to the severance benefits provided above, all of his then unvested restricted stock or stock options shall become immediately vested.
 Todd A. Waltz
On March 15, 2010, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Waltz to serve as the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Under Mr. Waltz's employment agreement, Mr. Waltz originally received an annual salary of $180,000 per year, subject to annual review and adjustments. Effective January 1, 2017, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee approved an increase in his annual salary from $230,000 per year to $250,000 per year. Mr. Waltz is entitled to an annual bonus of up to $50,000. For 2018, the annual bonus for Mr. Waltz was based on an estimation of his contribution to the goals achieved by the Company, as defined by the same formula applied to the Chief Executive Officer. This bonus amount was then scaled to $40,000 to reflect the amount of cash available for executive bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year. The initial term of Mr. Waltz's employment agreement was for three years with automatic one-year renewals unless terminated by either party on sixty days' notice prior to the end of the then-current extension period. If, prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement), Mr. Waltz is terminated other than for Cause (as defined in the agreement) or as a result of his death or Total Disability (as defined in the agreement) or is Constructively Terminated (as defined in the agreement), then provided he signs a release of claims, Mr. Waltz is entitled to severance benefits of (i) cash payments equal to his monthly base salary for a period of one (1) year payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices, and (ii) company-paid health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for him and his dependents until the earlier of three (3) months following the date of termination or until such time as Mr. Waltz is covered under another employer's group policy for such benefits. If, on or following a Change of Control, Mr. Waltz's employment is Constructively Terminated or involuntarily terminated other than for Cause, death or Total Disability, then provided he signs a release of claims, in addition to the severance benefits provided above, all of his then unvested restricted stock or stock options shall become immediately vested.
 Andrew B. Foster
On May 22, 2007, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Foster to serve as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Under Mr. Foster's employment agreement, Mr. Foster originally received an annual salary of $180,000 per year, subject to annual review and adjustments. Effective January 1, 2017, the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee approved an increase in his annual salary from $210,000 per year to $230,000 per year. Mr. Foster is entitled to a discretionary annual bonus of up to $50,000. For 2018, the annual bonus for Mr. Foster was based on an estimation of his contribution to the goals achieved by the Company, as defined by the same formula applied to the Chief Executive Officer. This bonus amount was then scaled to $40,000 to reflect the amount of cash available for executive bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year. The initial term of Mr. Foster's employment agreement was for three years with automatic one-year renewals unless terminated by either party on sixty days' notice prior to the end of the then-current extension period. In addition, in connection with the execution of his employment agreement, the Company granted Mr. Foster an option to purchase a total of 300,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. One thirty-sixth (1/36th) of the shares subject to this stock option award vested each month after the Employment Commencement Date (defined by the agreement as October 1, 2006), so as to be 100% vested on the three-year anniversary of the Employment Commencement Date.
If, prior to a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement), Mr. Foster is terminated other than for Cause (as defined in the agreement) or as a result of his death or Total Disability (as defined in the agreement) or is Constructively Terminated (as defined in the agreement), then provided he signs a release of claims, Mr. Foster is entitled to severance benefits of (i) cash payments equal to his monthly base salary for a period of one (1) year payable in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices, and (ii) company-paid health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for him and his dependents until the earlier of three (3) months following the date of termination or until such time as Mr. Foster is covered under another employer's group policy for such benefits. If, on or following a Change of Control, Mr. Foster's employment is Constructively Terminated or involuntarily terminated other than for Cause, death or Total Disability, then provided he signs a release of claims, in addition to the severance benefits provided above, all of his then unvested restricted stock or stock options shall become immediately vested.

The following table quantifies the estimated payments and benefits that would be provided to each named executive officer upon the occurrence of the indicated event, assuming that the event occurred on December 31, 2018, pursuant to those arrangements described above in detail under the heading "Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change-In-Control Arrangements."

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based upon a review of those forms and representations regarding the need for filing Form 5, we believe during the year ended December 31, 2018 that each of our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.
In making this statement, we have relied upon examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments thereto, provided to the Company during and with respect to fiscal year 2018 and the written representations of its directors and executive officers.
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The following are transactions entered into in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and any currently proposed transaction, (i) in which the Company was or is to be a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and (iii) in which any director, executive officer, five percent stockholder or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving in advance any proposed related person transactions. The Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Company's policies with respect to related person transactions and overseeing compliance with such policies.
The Company owes Eric McAfee, the Company's Chairman and CEO, and McAfee Capital, owned by Eric McAfee, $0.4 million in connection with employment agreements and expense reimbursements previously accrued as salaries expense and accrued liabilities. The balance accrued related to these employment agreements was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company expensed $39 thousand and $49 thousand, respectively, to reimburse actual expenses incurred by McAfee Capital and related entities. The Company previously prepaid $0.2 million to Redwood Capital, a company controlled by Eric McAfee, for the Company's use of flight time on a corporate jet. As of December 31, 2018, $0.1 million remained as a prepaid expense.
As consideration for the reaffirmation of guaranties by McAfee Capital required by Amendment No. 13 and 14 to the Note Purchase Agreement which the Company entered into with Third Eye Capital on March 1, 2017 and March 27, 2018 respectively, the Company also agreed to pay $0.2 million for each year to McAfee Capital in exchange for providing the guaranties.

 OTHER MATTERS
Management does not know of any matter to be brought before the Annual Meeting, other than the matters described in the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement. The persons named in the form of proxy solicited by the Board will vote all proxies which have been properly executed, and if any matters not set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting are properly brought before the meeting, such persons will vote thereon in accordance with their best judgment.
 HOUSEHOLDING
 We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, a householding notice will be sent to stockholders who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, and they will receive only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement unless one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees. Each stockholder who participates in householding will continue to receive a separate proxy card.
If any stockholders in your household wish to receive a separate annual report and a separate proxy statement, they may call our Corporate Secretary, Todd Waltz, at (408) 213-0940 or write to Aemetis, Inc. at 20400 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 700, Cupertino, CA 95014. They may also send an email to our Corporate Secretary at twaltz@aemetis.com. Other stockholders who have multiple accounts in their names or who share an address with other stockholders can authorize us to discontinue mailings of multiple annual reports and proxy statements by calling or writing to Investor Relations at 20400 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 700, Cupertino, CA 95014, Attention: Investor Relations.

(a)           Limitations.
(i)           Incentive Stock Option Limit. Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 8(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
(c)           Option Exercise Price and Consideration.
(i)           Exercise Price. The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option shall be such price as is determined by the Administrator, but shall be subject to the following:
(A)           In the case of an Incentive Stock Option a)           granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant of such Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant; and b)           granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B)           In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(ii)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6(c), Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a transaction described in, and in a manner consistent with, Section 424(a) of the Code.
(iii)           Forms of Consideration. The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Administrator (and, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be determined at the time of grant). Such consideration may consist of, without limitation, (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) promissory note, (iv) surrender of other Shares which (x) shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, and (y) must be owned free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or security interests, if accepting such Shares, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, shall not result in any adverse accounting consequences to the Company, (v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with this Plan, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. In making its determination as to the type of consideration to accept, the Administrator shall consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company.
(d)           Exercise of Option.
(i)           Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms hereof at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised (together with any applicable withholding taxes). Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and this Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of this Plan.
Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(ii)           Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's termination as the result of the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to this Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to this Plan. (iii)           Disability of Participant. If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if, on the date of termination, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to this Plan. If, after termination, the Participant does not exercise the vested portion of his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to this Plan.
(iv)           Death of Participant. If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised by the Participant's designated beneficiary within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if, at the time of death, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to this Plan. If the vested portion of the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to this Plan.
9.           Stock Appreciation Rights.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 8(d) also will apply to Stock Appreciation Rights.
(f)           Payment of Stock Appreciation Right Amount. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
(i)           The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
(ii)           the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.

(c)           Transferability. Except as provided in this Section 10, Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable Period of Restriction.
(d)           Other Restrictions. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may impose such other restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock as it may deem advisable or appropriate. (e)           Removal of Restrictions. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock grant made under this Plan will be released from escrow as soon as practicable after the last day of the Period of Restriction. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.
(f)           Voting Rights. During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
(g)           Dividends and Other Distributions. During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
(h)           Return of Restricted Stock to Company. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, the Restricted Stock for which restrictions have not lapsed will revert to the Company and again will become available for grant under this Plan.
11.           Restricted Stock Units.
(a)           Grant. Restricted Stock Units may be granted at any time and from time to time as determined by the Administrator. Each Restricted Stock Unit grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine, including all terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, the number of Restricted Stock Units and the form of payout, which, subject to Section 11(d), may be left to the discretion of the Administrator.
(b)           Vesting Criteria and Other Terms. The Administrator will set vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which the criteria are met, will determine the number of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Participant. After the grant of Restricted Stock Units, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any restrictions for such Restricted Stock Units. Each Award of Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the vesting criteria, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion will determine. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.
(c)           Earning Restricted Stock Units. Upon meeting the applicable vesting criteria, the Participant will be entitled to receive a payout as specified in the Award Agreement.
(d)           Form and Timing of Payment. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the date(s) set forth in the Award Agreement. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in cash, Shares, or a combination thereof. Shares represented by Restricted Stock Units that are fully paid in cash again will be available for grant under this Plan.
(e)           Cancellation. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company.
12.           Performance Units and Performance Shares.
(a)           Grant of Performance Units/Shares. Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. The Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units/Shares granted to each Participant provided that during any Fiscal Year.
(b)           Value of Performance Units/Shares. Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
(c)           Performance Objectives and Other Terms. The Administrator will set performance objectives or other vesting provisions. The Administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment), or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion. Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may provide at the time of or following the date of grant for accelerated vesting for an Award of Performance Units/Shares.
(d)           Earning of Performance Units/Shares. After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such Performance Unit/Share. (e)           Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares. Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period), or in a combination thereof.
(f)           Cancellation of Performance Units/Shares. On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company and be available for future grant under this Plan.
13.           Leaves of Absence. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company, or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed three (3) months, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then six (6) months and one (1) day following the commencement of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
 14.           Transferability of Awards. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and may be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award may only be transferred (i) by will, (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution, (iii) to a revocable trust, or (iv) as permitted under the Rules as to Use of Form S-8, as amended, so as to continue to provide that the Award, and the Shares issued under the Award, continue to comply with the requirements of the S-8 registration statement.
15.           Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control.
(a)           Adjustments. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs, the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan, shall adjust the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under this Plan and/or the number, class, price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits set forth in Sections 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, such adjusted Award shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting schedule to which the underlying Award is subject.
(b)           Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
(c)           Merger or Change in Control. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or a Change in Control, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation in a merger or Change in Control refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, then the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Performance Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right is not assumed or substituted for in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the merger or Change in Control, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
For the purposes of this Section 15(c), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Performance Share or Performance Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Performance Share or Performance Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Performance Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Performance Units by the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 15(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
16.           Time of Granting Awards. The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be given to each Service Provider to whom an Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
17.           Amendment and Termination of this Plan.
(a)           Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend, or terminate this Plan.
(b)           Stockholder Approval. The Board shall obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
(c)           Effect of Amendment or Termination. No amendment, alteration, suspension, or termination of this Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by and between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of this Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under this Plan prior to the date of such termination. 18.           Tax Withholding.
(a)           Withholding Requirements. Prior to the delivery of any Shares or cash pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), the Company will have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, foreign, or other taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required to be withheld with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof).
(b)           Withholding Arrangements. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part by (without limitation) (i) paying cash, (ii) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, (iii) delivering to the Company already-owned Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (iv) selling a sufficient number of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant through such means as the Administrator may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. The amount of the withholding requirement will be deemed to include any amount which the Administrator agrees may be withheld at the time the election is made, not to exceed the amount determined by using the maximum federal, state, or local marginal income tax rates applicable to the Participant with respect to the Award on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld or delivered will be determined as of the date that the taxes are required to be withheld.
(c)           Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Plan or an Award Agreement, if any provision of this Plan or an Award Agreement contravenes any regulations or guidance promulgated under Section 409A of the Code or would cause an Award to be subject to additional taxes, accelerated taxation, interest, and/or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, such provision of this Plan or Award Agreement may be modified by the Administrator without the consent of the Participant in any manner the Administrator deems reasonable or necessary. In making such modifications the Administrator shall attempt, but shall not be obligated, to maintain, to the maximum extent practicable, the original intent of the applicable provision without contravening the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service or as a short-term deferral will be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. Moreover, any discretionary authority that the Administrator may have pursuant to this Plan shall not be applicable to an Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code to the extent such discretionary authority would contravene Section 409A of the Code or the guidance promulgated thereunder. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of this Section 19(c) in good faith; provided that neither the Company nor the Administrator nor any of the officers, employees, managers, directors, or representatives of the Company Group shall have any liability to Participants with respect to this Section 19(c).
19.           Recoupment. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, all Awards granted under this Plan, any payments made under this Plan and any Shares issued upon exercise of an Option or settlement of an Award shall be subject to clawback or recoupment as permitted or mandated by applicable law, rules, regulations or Company policy as enacted, adopted or modified from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision shall apply to any gains realized upon exercise or settlement of an Award or disposition of Shares received upon the exercise or settlement of an Award.
20.           Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.
(a)           Legal Compliance. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
(b)           Investment Representations. As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Administrator may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
21.           No Effect on Employment or Service. Neither this Plan nor any Award will confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing the Participant's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor will they interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
22.           Inability to Obtain Authority
. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
23.           Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, shall at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this Plan.
24.           Stockholder Approval. This Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date this Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval shall be obtained in the degree and manner required under Applicable Laws.
25.           Governing Law. The validity and enforceability of this Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to otherwise governing principles of conflicts of law.
