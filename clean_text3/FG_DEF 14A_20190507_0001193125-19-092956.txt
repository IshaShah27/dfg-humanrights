Executive Compensation Program Highlights 
The Compensation Committee has instituted a number of changes to our executive compensation programs to align with evolving competitive and governance practices, respond to feedback from our shareholders and strengthen the link to performance and rigor of our program. These changes have included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentives. We allocated a larger percentage of our performance metrics under the  Employee Incentive Program to financial objectives in order to meet our shareholders' focus on our financial performance.  
• Long-Term Incentives. We established a five-year incentive program for our Named Executive  Officers that provides for a one-time award of stock options, leveraging a mix of time-based and performance-based stock options to ensure alignment with shareholder interests.  
[END TABLE]
For a detailed discussion of our executive compensation program, please see the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  PROPOSAL NO. 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Three persons have been nominated for election as directors at the annual meeting, all of whom currently serve as directors. Our Board is divided into three classes of as nearly equal number of directors as possible. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. 
The term of each class of directors is three years, with the term for one class expiring each year in rotation. As a result, one class of directors is elected at each annual shareholders meeting for a term of three years, to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier death, removal or resignation. The term of the current Class C directors expires at our annual meeting. 
Director Nominees and Continuing Directors

* Independent director. See "Corporate Governance – Director Independence" below. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposes nominees for election to our Board and such nominees are reviewed and approved by the entirety of our Board. Pursuant to the Nominating and Voting Agreement, Messrs. Foley and Chu, who are non-management directors of the company, and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Fund II L.P. ("BTO"), a shareholder of the company, (the "Nominating Parties") generally may designate one director nominee for election at each general meeting. Mr. Chee was designated as a nominee by the Nominating Parties. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Board recommend each nominee for director be elected at our annual meeting. The nominees have consented to continue to serve as directors if elected.  Under our charter, the number of directors may be increased or reduced by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Any vacancies or newly created directorships may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and the elected person will serve the remainder of the term of the class to which he or she is appointed. Each director will hold office until the expiration of their respective terms and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. In addition, if a nominee becomes unavailable for any reason or should a vacancy occur before the election, which we do not anticipate, the proxies will be voted for the election, as director, of such other person as our Board may recommend. 
Our Board of directors is led by our Co-Chairmen, Messrs. Chu and Foley. Our Board as determined that Messrs. Abell, Baird, Massey, Quella and Walsh are independent within the meaning of the federal securities laws and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Rules.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board Structure and Risk Oversight 
Messrs. Chu and Foley each serve as a Co-Chairman of our Board and Mr. Blunt serves as our Chief Executive Officer. The board has no policy with respect to the separation of the offices of chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The board believes it is important to retain the flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the chairman and Chief Executive Officer in any way that is in the best interests of our company at a given point in time. Our Board believes that we benefit from this structure and, based upon extensive experience of each such individual, Messrs. Chu's and Foley's continuation as our Co-Chairmen and Mr. Blunt's service as our Chief Executive Officer is in the best interests of our shareholders. 
Our management is responsible for understanding and managing the risks that we face in our business, and our Board is responsible for overseeing management's overall approach to risk management. Our Board receives reports on the operations of our businesses from members of management of our company and its subsidiaries as appropriate and discusses related risks. Our Board also fulfills its oversight role through the operations of our Audit Committee, Compensation  Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. As appropriate, these committees of our Board provide periodic reports to our Board on their activities. Our Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of financial and enterprise risk management practices, including those related to our accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the oversight of our compensation policies and practices, including conducting annual risk assessments of our compensation policies and practices. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for assisting our Board with our overall corporate governance, including board and committee composition, board nominees, size and structure and director independence, and our overall corporate governance. 
Director Criteria, Qualifications and Selection 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposes nominees for election to our Board and those nominees are reviewed and approved by the entirety of our Board. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may use a variety of means to identify nominees. The committee has the authority to hire consultants and search firms for the purpose of identifying candidates. Our Board seeks members from diverse professional backgrounds who combine a broad spectrum of experience and expertise with a reputation for integrity. Individuals will be considered for nomination to the Board based on their business and professional experience, judgment, diversity (including age, gender, nationality, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation), skills and background. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, individuals over the age of 72 will generally not stand for election or re-election to our Board. 
In selecting candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board take diversity into account, seeking to ensure a representation of a broad spectrum of viewpoints, experience and expertise. Although the company does not prescribe specific standards for diversity, we have adopted considerations under our Corporate Governance Guidelines to further promote the consideration of diversity of experiences, backgrounds and ideas within the selection process. 
The committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders in the same manner that it considers candidates identified through other sources. The name of any recommended candidate for director, together with a brief biographical sketch, a document indicating the candidate's willingness to serve if elected, and evidence of the nominating shareholder's ownership of company stock must be sent in care of the corporate secretary to the following address: 4th Floor, Boundary Hall, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands KY1-1102. In addition, a shareholder who wishes to nominate persons for election as directors must follow the procedures described in our charter. Please see the additional information in the section captioned "Shareholder Proposals." 
The company is a party to a nominating and voting agreement (the "Nominating and Voting Agreement") with Messrs. Foley and Chu, and BTO (the "Nominating Parties"). The Nominating and Voting Agreement is intended to preserve continuity of leadership of the founding sponsors and lead investor to preserve the F&G investment thesis and long-term perspective upon which the company was founded. Pursuant to the Nominating and Voting Agreement, if the Nominating Parties and their respective affiliates own, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares, the Nominating Parties will have the right to designate one director nominee for election at each general meeting of the company. If the Nominating Parties and their  respective affiliates own, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, at least 12% but less than 20% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares (the "Two Director Range"), the Nominating Parties will have the right to designate one director nominee for each of the two director classes (the "Two Director Classes") to be voted on at the two general meetings of the company immediately after the aggregate ownership of ordinary shares comes within the Two Director Range and for each subsequent meeting at which one of the Two Director Classes is to be voted on by the shareholders, provided that such aggregate ownership remains within the Two Director Range at the time of each such nomination. If the Nominating Parties and their respective affiliates own, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, at least 5% but less than 12% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares (the "One Director Range"), the Nominating Parties will have the right to designate one director nominee for the class of directors (the "One Director Class") to be voted on at the general meeting of the company immediately after the aggregate ownership of ordinary shares comes within the One Director Range and for each subsequent meeting at which the One Director Class is to be voted on by the shareholders, provided that such aggregate ownership remains within the One Director Range at the time of each such nomination. Director nominees selected under the Nominating and Voting Agreement will be selected by the vote of any two of Mr. Chu, Mr. Foley and BTO. In addition, pursuant to the Nominating and Voting Agreement, each of Mr. Foley, Mr. Chu and BTO agreed to vote for each director so nominated. 
Board and Committee Meetings 
The Board held a total of five meetings during fiscal 2018. In addition to meetings of the Board, our directors also attended committee meetings.

The company does not have a formal policy regarding the attendance of directors at annual general meetings, but we encourage all of our directors to attend. Three of our directors attended the 2018 annual general meeting. 
Meetings of Non-Management Directors 
We generally hold executive sessions of non-management directors at each board and committee meeting and not less than once per year. The co-chairmen of the board preside over executive sessions of the entire board and the chairman of each committee presides over the executive session of that committee. 
Director Independence 
Our Board has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Abell, Baird, Massey, Quella and Walsh are independent directors under NYSE Corporate Governance Standards. Under NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, no director qualifies as independent unless our Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with our company. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning their background, employment and affiliations, including commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships, our  Board has determined that each of the independent directors named above has no material relationship with our company and is independent within the meaning of NYSE Corporate Governance Standards.

 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the compensation of our non-employee directors and making recommendations to the Board.

In 2018, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") conducted a competitive analysis of our company's compensation peer group with respect to board compensation.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
Our Conflicts Committee is responsible for reviewing any transaction with a related party pursuant to the policy and procedures in the committee's charter. The Conflicts Committee charter provides procedures for the approval of transactions with related persons as set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC as well as "affiliate transactions" that require approval pursuant to the covenants set forth in any indenture, credit agreement or similar agreement of the company. These procedures provide that the Conflicts Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving all affiliate transactions, which include: any transaction between our company or its subsidiaries and our affiliates; any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which the amount involved may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our company or its subsidiaries will be a participant, and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest; and any transaction described as an affiliate transaction in any indenture, credit agreement or similar agreement of our company. The Conflicts Committee considers relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether or not to approve or ratify an affiliate transaction, and will approve or ratify only those transactions that are, in the committee's judgment, fair to the company under the circumstances. In addition, Board approval is required for affiliate transactions required to comply with covenants set forth in any indenture, credit agreement or similar agreement of the company.  Related Person Transactions 
In addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described above in the section entitled "Executive Compensation," the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2018 and each currently proposed transaction in which (i) we have been or are to be a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and (iii) any of our directors, nominees for director, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our ordinary shares, or any member of their immediate families or person sharing their household had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Blackstone and such directors had previously confirmed their intent to tender all of the warrants they held, in their sole discretion, subject to the waivable condition that at least 70% of the outstanding warrants were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the offer to exchange. The purchases from Blackstone and our directors were on the same terms that were available to all holders of our warrants. GSO Capital Partners LP ("GSO") and FNF, each holders of our preferred shares, executed consents to the offer to exchange. 
Investment Management Agreements 
We, and certain subsidiaries of ours, entered into investment management agreements with Blackstone ISG-I Advisors LLC ("BISGA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Blackstone Group LP ("Blackstone") in November and December of 2017, pursuant to which BISGA was appointed as investment manager of the companies' general accounts (the "F&G Accounts"). Pursuant to the terms  of the investment management agreements, BISGA may delegate certain of its investment management services to sub-managers and any fees or other remuneration payable to such sub-managers is payable by the company out of the assets managed by such sub-managers. BISGA has delegated certain investment management services to its affiliates, Blackstone Real Estate Special Situations Advisors L.L.C. ("BRESSA") and GSO Capital Advisors II LLC ("GSO Capital Advisors"), pursuant to sub-management agreements executed between BISGA and each of BRESSA and GSO Capital Advisors. BISGA will forgo approximately 30% of the first 13 months' management fee to which it is entitled under the investment management agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the fees paid to BISGA under the investment management agreements were approximately $48 million. As of December 31, 2018, the company had a net liability of $20 million for the services provided under the investment management agreements and related sub-management agreements, partially offset by fees received and expense reimbursements from BISGA. During fiscal 2018, we received expense reimbursements from BISGA for the services consumed under the agreements. The fees received for these services were $9 for fiscal 2018. 
Investment Management Agreement Termination Side Letter 
On November 30, 2017, the company entered into a side letter agreement (the "Investment Management Agreement Termination Side Letter") with BISGA, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the company agreed to not cause, permit or suffer Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("FGL Insurance"), to terminate the FGL Insurance investment management agreement or certain other subsidiaries of the company to terminate certain investment management agreements entered into between such subsidiaries of the company and BISGA on the same terms as the FGL Insurance investment management agreement, except following an initial three-year term, commencing on the dates of such agreements, and thereafter following each one year anniversary of the closing date of the Business Combination, and unless such agreements are terminated in accordance with the other terms and conditions of the Investment Management Agreement Termination Side Letter. After the initial three-year term, FGL Insurance and the other subsidiaries party to the investment management agreements may provide BISGA two years' prior notice of an intention to terminate the investment management agreement, if authorized by the Chief Executive Officer of the company and at least two-thirds of the directors of the company who are not current officers or employees of BISGA or its corporate affiliates, provided that such persons acting reasonably and in good faith have determined that BISGA's unsatisfactory long term performance has been materially detrimental to the company or that fees charged by BISGA are unfair and excessive compared to those that would be charged by a comparable asset manager. The investment management agreements further provide that BISGA may during the two-year notice period address the directors' long term performance concerns or adjust the fees payable to BISGA to be not higher than a comparable asset manager, either of which actions would result in the termination notice being automatically rescinded and of no further force or effect. 
Sub-Advisory Agreement 
On November 30, 2017, BISGA appointed MVB Management, LLC, an entity owned by affiliates of the company's Co-Chairmen, Messrs. Chu and Foley ("MVB Management"), as sub-adviser of the F&G Accounts pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement"). Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, MVB Management provides investment advisory services, portfolio review,  and consultation with regard to the F&G Accounts (and the accounts of the other company subsidiaries party to investment management agreements) and the asset classes and markets contemplated by the investment guidelines specified in the Sub-Advisory Agreement, including such recommendations as BISGA shall reasonably request. BISGA pays the Sub-Adviser, pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, a subadvisory fee of approximately 15% of certain fees paid to BISGA and its affiliates pursuant to the investment management agreements. Payment or reimbursement of the subadvisory fee to the Sub-Adviser is solely the obligation of BISGA and is not an obligation of FGL Insurance or the Company. Subject to certain conditions, the Sub- Advisory Agreement cannot be terminated by BISGA unless the investment management agreements are terminated. For fiscal 2018, the fees paid by BISGA to MVB Management were approximately $1.3 million. 
Affiliate Investments 
We hold certain fixed income security interests, limited partnership interests and bank loans issued by portfolio companies that are affiliates of Blackstone Tactical Opportunities, an affiliate of Blackstone Tactical Opportunities LR Associates-B (Cayman) Ltd., both on a direct and indirect basis.

In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to invest in 13 other affiliated investments. The unfunded commitments relating to these affiliated investments at December 31, 2018 was $990 million. 
BTO/FNF Letter Agreement 
On November 30, 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Advisors LLC (the "BTO Advisors") and FNF, and on November 2, 2018, we amended the letter agreement to extend its term. As amended, the agreement stipulates that BTO Advisors and FNF will provide at the company's request, from time to time from the closing date of the Business Combination until June 30, 2019, general consulting services, access to BTO Advisor's group purchase organization, financial advisory services, and advisory consulting services relating to potential mergers and acquisitions. In consideration for such services that may be rendered, the company has agreed to pay, on a non-recurring basis, BTO Advisors or its designees up to $10.0 million, payable in cash, ordinary shares, or warrants at the company's option and to FNF, up to $6.0 million payable in cash, ordinary shares, or warrants at the company's option. The actual amounts payable for such services shall be negotiated in good faith by the company and the applicable party to provide such services when such services are rendered. 
GSO Side Letter 
On May 24, 2017, we entered into a side letter agreement, as amended on October 6, 2017, (the "GSO Side Letter") with GSO, providing that the terms of the preferred shares issued to GSO include: a dividend rate of 7.5% per annum (subject to increase in the period beginning 10 years after issuance based on the then-current three-month LIBOR rate), payable quarterly in cash or additional preferred shares of the company, at the company's option; five year call protection; and the right of holders thereof to request the company to remarket the preferred shares commencing in the sixth year  following issuance, subject to the terms and conditions specified therein. In addition, GSO has the right, commencing 10 years after the issuance of the preferred shares, provided that GSO has first requested the company to remarket the preferred shares as described below, to convert such shares into a number of ordinary shares of the company as determined by dividing (i) the aggregate par value (including dividends paid in kind and unpaid accrued dividends) of the preferred shares that GSO wishes to convert by (ii) the higher of (a) a 5% discount to the 30-day VWAP of the ordinary shares following the conversion notice, and (b) the then-current Floor Price. 
From and after November 30, 2022, upon GSO's request, we are required (subject to customary black-out provisions) to remarket the preferred shares on their existing terms. To the extent market conditions make such remarketing impracticable, we may temporarily delay such remarketing provided that the preferred shares are re-marketed within six months of the date of GSO's initial request. To the extent it is unlikely that remarketing the preferred shares on the then existing terms will receive a valuation by a prospective purchaser of par or greater than par, we may, upon GSO's request, modify the terms of the preferred shares to improve the sale of such shares with the intention of preserving rating agency equity credit. If the proceeds from any sales resulting from such marketing are less than the outstanding balance of the applicable preferred shares (including dividends paid in kind and unpaid accrued dividends), we will reimburse GSO up to a maximum of 10% of par (including paid in kind and unpaid accrued dividends) for actual losses incurred by GSO upon the sale of its preferred shares under the terms of the remarketing mechanism, with such amount payable either in cash, ordinary shares, or any combination thereof, at the company's option. If the company chooses to deliver ordinary shares to GSO, the number of such shares to be delivered will be determined by dividing (i) the amount of actual losses to be paid to GSO by (ii) the higher of (a) an 8% discount to the 30-day volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares following the remarketing period, and (b) $6.00.

Our Business

Through our subsidiaries, we are a leading provider of annuity and life insurance products. We acquired Fidelity & Guaranty Life, a Delaware corporation ("FGL"), on November 30, 2017 (the "Business Combination").

Executive Compensation Highlights 
The Compensation Committee has instituted a number of changes to our executive compensation programs to align with evolving competitive and governance practices, respond to feedback from our shareholders and strengthen the link to performance and rigor of our program. These changes have included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentives. We allocated a larger percentage of our performance metrics under the  Employee Incentive Program to financial objectives in order to meet our shareholders' focus on our financial performance.  
• Long-Term Incentives. We established an incentive program for our NEOs that provides for a one-time award of stock options intended to provide equity compensation for a five-year period, leveraging a mix of time-based and performance-based stock options to ensure alignment with shareholder interests.   
[END TABLE]
 2019 Appointment of CEO 
Christopher O. Blunt joined our company as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 2, 2019. In, developing our compensatory arrangement with Mr. Blunt, the Board considered Mr. Blunt's then current compensation, including his current equity, the compensation of our former President and Chief Executive Officer, and the compensation of chief executive officers of other similarly sized insurance companies. In designing a compensation package for Mr. Blunt, the Board determined to provide him the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual base salary of $800,000,  
• target bonus opportunity equal to 200% of his base salary, and  
• sign-on bonus in the amount of $2,250,000 payable within  30 days following March 15, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Upon a termination without "cause" or by Mr. Blunt for "good reason," he will be entitled to receive severance benefits equal to three times his base salary, acceleration of certain unvested options and 18 months of benefit continuation. In addition, Mr. Blunt will be subject to certain restrictive covenants that apply both during his employment with the company and for certain durations afterwards. 
The Board also determined to grant a one-time award of stock options covering a five-year period to Mr. Blunt for 3.2 million shares, subject to a combination of time and performance-based vesting, as well as a stretch award of stock options for 613,476 shares, subject to performance-based vesting, as inducements to his employment by us. The awards are intended to provide Mr. Blunt's equity compensation for this period. The stock options were issued outside of our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan as employment inducement awards pursuant to NYSE rules. The Board determined that the overall compensation package would be sufficient to encourage Mr. Blunt to join our company, yet would help support the creation of shareholder value and be in the best interests of our shareholders.

[END TABLE]
Compensation Practices 
Market and industry practices are taken into account when developing compensation programs. Third-party market industry surveys and compensation data from other public companies are utilized when reviewing compensation. We consider our peer group to be companies in our industry that are similar in size to us, that have business models similar to ours and that compete with us for customers, labor and capital.  Our goal is to align total compensation to the competitive market within our peer group while being mindful of internal equity. Salaries are reviewed annually in a process correlated to our performance management program and a competitive base salary market review. Incentives are the primary motivators to achieve business goals and strong business or individual performance can result in above-market incentives. 
The Committee leverages the following best practices in designing, administering and governing our executive compensation programs:

Our Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the compensation and benefits strategy for our employees, including our NEOs, authorizing and ratifying equity grants and other incentive arrangements, and authorizing employment and related agreements. The Compensation Committee has the full authority of the Board to make compensation decisions relating to our NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its responsibilities to sub-committees as the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate, provided that the sub-committees are composed entirely of directors satisfying the independence standards then applicable to the Compensation Committee generally. The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate responsibilities regarding some activities that are below certain thresholds to management, provided that no member of management is delegated authority of his or her own compensation.  Role of our Executive Officers 
Although our Compensation Committee has the authority to make final decisions with respect to executive compensation, our Senior Vice President, Human Resources in partnership with our Chief Executive Officer, drive the design and implementation of all executive compensation programs. The goal is to ensure that the design of our compensation programs supports our overall strategy. Except for his own compensation, the Chief Executive Officer has final management-level review of any compensation program or individual element of compensation for our NEOs before they are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and our other NEOs do not participate in discussions regarding their own compensation. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
Prior to establishing our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee and management reviewed our executive compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee also conducted on-going assessments of our compensation structure. The committee retained FW Cook to serve as our compensation consultant and to assist and advise the Compensation Committee in connection with compensation policies and practices, including the design and setup of our long-term incentive program. FW Cook reviewed the structure and mechanics of the various components of our compensation programs and practices. In order to obtain a complete view of the competitive market for talent, FW Cook considered data from publicly available peer company proxy statements, and, as a secondary view of the market, considered data from published survey sources, which includes industry peers from privately held and publicly traded organizations. In particular, FW Cook analyzed two key elements: pay magnitude and pay practices. Pay magnitude relates to overall base pay delivery, base salaries, annual and long-term incentive targets and payouts. Pay practices is the assessment of the design attributes of other organizations' incentive plans that provide perspectives on performance measurement, the mix of long-term incentive vehicles, vesting and shareholding requirements. 
FW Cook completed an assessment indicating that the current compensation structure is sound and well-balanced, and demonstrates alignment between company performance and executive compensation.  Compensation Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee reviewed recommendations from FW Cook based on a peer group of insurance companies. FW Cook conducted a market analysis that included several data points using peer group comparators and relevant survey data to develop a clear assessment of current compensation practices in our industry. In order to provide peer comparison data, FW Cook utilized data from multiple sources. The primary survey source is LOMA. FW Cook utilizes a comparison of peer data of same or similar sized companies with total assets in the category of $10 billion to $40 billion. There were 22 companies that participated in the LOMA survey:

 Shareholder Approval of our Executive Compensation Program 
In deciding on the structure of the executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee took into account the perspectives of our shareholders. Following our 2018 Annual General Meeting , the Compensation Committee reviewed the results of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation (the "say on pay" vote). Our proposal regarding the "say on pay" vote was approved by approximately 99.90% of the votes cast on the proposal in support of the compensation of our NEOs. We continue to consider the perspectives of our shareholders in the design and administration of our executive compensation programs. 
Following our 2018 Annual General Meeting, our Board also reviewed the results of the shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of "say on pay" votes. Approximately 64.97% of the votes cast supported a frequency of every three years for future "say on pay" votes. Consistent with the recommendation of our Board and the preference of our shareholders as reflected in the shareholder advisory vote, we will hold a "say on pay" vote every three years. 
Other Related Considerations 
Relationship of Compensation Policies and Practices to Risk Management 
We believe that our compensation policies and practices are designed to promote a strong risk management culture. We have reviewed our compensation programs and employee policies and practices and have determined that they do not encourage excessive risk taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.  Components of Our Executive Compensation Program 
For fiscal 2018, our compensation program consisted of the following key components:

 Set forth below is a discussion of each component of compensation, the rationale for each component, and how each component fits into our overall compensation philosophy. 
Base Salary 
We provide a base salary to compensate our executives for their services rendered on a day-to-day basis during the year. Base salaries are set to attract and retain executives with qualities necessary to ensure our short-term and long-term financial success. Base salary levels are set to be competitive with the salaries of executives in similar positions with similar responsibilities at comparable companies. The determination of an executive's base salary is based on market compensation rates and individual factors, including personal performance and contribution, experience in the role, scope of responsibility and overall impact on the business. Base salaries are reviewed annually and adjusted when necessary to reflect market conditions as well as individual roles and performance. 
The table below shows base salaries for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Fiscal 2018 Base Salary 
 Christopher J. Littlefield    $800,000 
 Dennis R. Vigneau    $440,000 
 Eric L. Marhoun    $350,000 
 John A. Phelps, II    $325,000 
 John D. Currier    $300,000 
[END TABLE]
Short-Term Incentives 
In order to promote our "pay for performance" culture, we pay annual cash incentives to our executives for achieving performance targets that support financial and corporate goals. Our short-term incentives consist of an Employee Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), which allows for annual cash-based bonus awards intended to attract and retain the best available executive officers to be responsible for the management, growth, and success of our business and to provide an incentive for such individuals to exert their best efforts on behalf of our company and shareholders. Our Chief Executive Officer and executive team develop an annual business plan that includes objectives to drive short- and long-term business performance. The Compensation Committee reviews these objectives and establishes performance targets. Performance against plan objectives are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee to establish the bonus pool for each performance period. Short-term incentive payouts require that minimum targets be satisfied and allow for recognition of individual performance and contribution toward those goals.  The EIP includes a financial performance component based on the annual business plan weighted at 85% and a corporate initiatives component weighted at 15%. For fiscal 2018, the performance metrics for the EIP were:

The Compensation Committee approved the percentage of base salary paid for performance at the target levels depicted below. If a minimum performance measure is satisfied, depending on actual performance, bonus payments under the EIP could range from 50% to 150% of target. As a result of the corporate performance against our goals for fiscal 2018, the bonus pool for determining individual executive incentive awards was 144% of target. The awards will be paid in March 2019.

Long-Term Incentives 
We provide long-term incentive opportunities to motivate and reward our executive officers for their contributions toward achieving our business objectives and the interests of our shareholders. We believe that equity-based awards link compensation levels with performance results and ensure sustained alignment with shareholder interests. Additionally, we believe equity awards provide an important retention tool, because the awards are subject to multi-year vesting. In furtherance of these objectives, we adopted the FGL Holdings 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, under which we grant equity awards.  In 2018, the Compensation Committee established long-term award opportunities for each of the NEOs through a five-year incentive program that provides for a one-time award of stock options. The Compensation Committee approved these one-time grants covering long-term award targets for the five-year period in lieu of annual awards. In establishing these awards, the Compensation Committee considered its desire to strategically align the long term incentives to the long term success of our business. In addition, a stretch award was granted to drive extraordinary performance of the stock price over the five-year period of the grant. 
Our long-term incentives for NEOs consist of three forms of stock option awards that incent long-term value creation: time-vesting options that reward increases in the market value of our shares and continued service with our company; stock price options that reward the achievement of our long-term goals for increasing the market price of our shares; and performance options that reward the achievement of our long-term performance goals as determined by Adjusted Operating ROE. The mix of long-term incentives granted in 2018 to the NEOs is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Performance Options     1/3

Time-Vesting Options 
Time-vesting options provide value based solely on stock price appreciation. The time-vesting options granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 will vest in five equal annual installments beginning on March 15, 2019, based on continued service, and will expire on May 15, 2025. The exercise price is $10 per share. The number of time-vesting options granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 were as follows:

Stock price options align our long-term incentives to the appreciation of our share price. Stock price options vest based on achievement of both stock price goals and continued service requirements and will expire on May 15, 2025. 
In 2018, our NEOs were awarded two grants of stock price options: target stock price options that vest in five equal installments upon the later of the achievement of five stock price goals or the applicable continued service requirement; and stretch stock price options that vest in five equal installments based on both continued service during the performance period and achievement of the stock price goal for the applicable one-year performance period. The number of target stock price options and stretch period stock price options granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 were as follows:

Performance Options 
Performance options align our long-term incentives to the achievement of our Adjusted Operating ROE objectives. Performance options vest in equal installments based on continued service and achievement of separate three-year, four-year and five-year Adjusted Operating ROE goals established at the start of the five year period and will expire on May 15, 2025.  In 2018, our NEOs were awarded two grants of performance options, with the first based on target performance goals and the second based on stretch performance goals.

FGL entered into incentive award letters with Mr. Vigneau, Mr. Marhoun, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Currier dated February 1, 2017. The incentive award letters provide for the grant of a cash award in lieu of the December 2015 and December 2016 ordinary course discretionary long-term equity incentive awards that FGL was not permitted to make to its executive officers under the terms of its merger agreement with Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, which was terminated on April 17, 2017. The 2017 incentive awards were granted in recognition of the continued commitment and contributions of  FGL's executives during this period. These incentive awards vest in installments on December 1, 2017, December 3, 2018 and December 2, 2019, subject to the executive's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. They will also vest in full if the executive's employment is terminated by without "cause" prior to December 2, 2019 or if the executive's position is eliminated and the executive is not offered "comparable employment" before November 30, 2018, the first anniversary of the completion of the Business Combination. 
The amount of each incentive award installment is set forth in the following table:

Retention Awards 
On April 20, 2017, FGL entered into retention award letters with Mr. Vigneau, Mr. Marhoun, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Currier. The retention award letters provided that, among other things, if the NEO remained employed through the first anniversary of the completion of a transaction resulting in a change in control, then the NEO would receive a lump sum cash retention payment in an amount equal to a specified percentage of the NEO's annual base salary as in effect on April 20, 2017. In December 2018, Mr. Vigneau, Mr. Marhoun, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Currier received the amounts due under the retention award letters. The amount of each retention award is set forth in the following table:

Other Executive Compensation Arrangements, Policies and Practices 
Our executives are eligible to participate in our tax-qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan and our health and welfare plans on the same basis as our other salaried employees. Our executives also participate in a limited number of perquisite programs.  401(k) Plan 
Under the 401(k) Plan, our company will match 100% of a participant's contributions up to five percent of compensation, subject to the limits specified in the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The employer match vests immediately. The 401(k) plan also allows for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, which historically have been two percent of earnings, subject to limits under the Code. Any profit sharing contributions are immediately vested. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Arrangements 
We permit our executives to defer on an elective basis a specified portion of their base salaries and performance-based bonus compensation, if any. See the narrative description following the table entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" below for more information surrounding the terms of the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
We also offer a package of insurance benefits to all salaried employees, including our executives, including health, vision and dental insurance, basic life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and short- and long-term disability insurance. 
Limited Executive Perquisites 
All of our executives are eligible to participate in the Executive Life Insurance Plan. Under this plan, the beneficiary of a participant who dies while employed by us is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to three times his or her annual base salary at the time of hire. Our executives are also offered physical examinations at our cost once biannually. The value of these executive perquisites is reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table below. 
We maintain no defined benefit pension plans or retiree medical plans. 
Prohibition of Short Sales, Derivatives Trading, Hedging and Pledging of Our Securities 
Our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting designated employees, including the NEOs, and directors from engaging in any short sales of our securities, or transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities with respect to any of our equity securities. Unless first pre-cleared by our General Counsel, the policy also prohibits all employees, including the NEOs, and directors from entering into hedging transactions with respect to our securities or pledging our securities as collateral for any loan, including margin accounts. 
Policy on Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans 
We have adopted a policy for Rule 10b5-1 trading plans for designated employees, including the NEOs, and directors, which allow for transactions in our securities pursuant to a pre-established written plan meeting certain requirements. Any Rule 10b5-1 plan must (a) be in writing and in a form  acceptable to the company; (b) be acknowledged in writing by the General Counsel of the company prior to the plan becoming effective; (c) contain such terms and conditions as may be required by Rule 10b5-1; and (d) not be entered into, amended or terminated during a blackout period or when the person is in possession of material nonpublic information. 
Employment and Other Severance, Change-in-Control and Related Agreements 
Employment Agreements 
We believe that having employment agreements with our NEOs is beneficial to us because they provide retentive value, subject the executives to key restrictive covenants, and generally provide us with a competitive advantage in the recruiting process over companies that do not offer employment agreements. In October 2014, FGL entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Littlefield, and, in connection with Mr. Littlefield's assumption of the role of Chief Executive Officer, amended and restated the employment agreement in May 2015. In November 2013, FGL entered into a new employment agreements with Mr. Marhoun and Mr. Phelps. In January 2014, FGL entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Vigneau. These employment agreements include the specific terms set forth in greater detail below in "—Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table." We do not currently have an employment agreement with Mr. Currier. 
Separation Agreements 
Mr. Littlefield's resignation from our company was treated as a qualifying termination that was eligible for severance benefits under his employment agreement. In connection with Mr. Littlefield's resignation, we entered into a separation agreement and release with Mr. Littlefield that provides him with the separation benefits provided for under his prior employment agreement and a one-time payment of $500,000, which was paid in connection with the cancellation of all Mr. Littlefield's outstanding stock options. As a condition to receiving his separation payments, Mr. Littlefield agreed to continue to be subject to the restrictive covenants set forth in his prior employment agreement. This agreement includes the specific terms set forth in greater detail below in "Summary Compensation Table—Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table – Separation Agreement."  Compensation Committee Report 
Our Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" contained in this report with our management. Based on such review and discussions, the committee recommended to our Board that the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" be included in this proxy statement and, thereby, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for fiscal 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by the "pay ratio" rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we determined the annual total compensation of the estimated median of the annual total compensation of all employees, except our current President and Chief Executive Officer (our "non-CEO median employee") and present a comparison of that annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO"). In accordance with SEC rules, for 2018, we have calculated: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of our non-CEO median  employee was $70,508  
• The annual total compensation of our CEO was $14,624,758  
• The estimated pay ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total  compensation of our non-CEO median employee was 208:1  
[END TABLE]
As permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, to identify our non-CEO median employee we used a commonly accepted compensation measure, "total cash compensation," which includes annual base pay plus all commissions and bonuses paid during the fiscal year. We used October 1, 2018, as our determination day, and included all 307 full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees of F&G and its subsidiaries globally, other than our CEO. We annualized pay for those who commenced work during the fiscal year. After we identified our non-CEO median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for both our CEO and our non-CEO median employee, using the same definition for total compensation set forth in this proxy statement's Summary Compensation Table plus the value of benefits and employer retirement contributions not reported therein. These benefits include company contributions to the medical, dental and basic life insurance plans. 
Mr. Littlefield served as our CEO until December 19, 2018. As allowed when a CEO does not serve for the entire fiscal year, we annualized his compensation for purposes of the pay ratio estimation. Mr. Littlefield's annualized total compensation for our fiscal year was $14,624,758, which included annualized base salary through the end of the fiscal year.  This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different methodologies that various public companies use to determine an estimate of their pay ratios and our unique situation in annualizing the compensation and including one-time separation payments to our partial-year CEO, the estimated pay ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
In addition to the pay ratio calculated above, we believe another potentially helpful measure of CEO compensation is to exclude from Mr. Littlefield's total cash compensation the one-time compensation he received in connection with his resignation from our company, other than amounts related to our EIP. If Mr. Littlefield's compensation in connection with his separation agreement were excluded, other than the $1,100,000 paid with respect to the EIP, Mr. Littlefield's annualized total compensation would have been $10,924,758 and our estimate of the ratio of the adjusted annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our non-CEO median employee would have been 155:1.  SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 
The following table summarizes the total compensation paid to our NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the three month transition period ended December 31, 2017 ("TP 2017"), and FGL's fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017.

Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers 
Separation Agreement with Christopher J. Littlefield 
Mr. Littlefield's resignation from our company was treated as a qualifying termination that was eligible for separation benefits under his employment agreement. In connection with Mr. Littlefield's resignation from the company on December 19, 2018, we entered into a separation agreement and release with Mr. Littlefield on December 19, 2018 (the "separation agreement"). The separation agreement provided for the payment of the amounts due under his employment agreement for a termination without cause, including accrued obligations, an amount equal to $1,100,000 with respect to Mr. Littlefield's annual bonus for 2018, $1,288,461 in a cash lump sum, $1,911,538, representing an amount equal to the sum of two times his annual base salary and two times his target annual cash bonus, and a one-time payment of $500,000 in connection with the cancellation of his outstanding stock options. The separation agreement also provided for the payment of Mr. Littlefield's legal fees of up to $50,000 in connection with negotiating the separation agreement. 
As a condition to receiving his payments under the separation agreement, Mr. Littlefield agreed to continue to be subject to the restrictive covenants set forth in his prior employment agreement. Mr. Littlefield will be subject to a 12-month non-solicitation covenant related to clients and independent marketing organizations of the company; a 12-month non-competition covenant; and an 18-month non-solicitation of employees covenant.  Employment Agreement with Christopher J. Littlefield 
On May 6, 2015, FGL entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Littlefield. The employment agreement provided for a term through September 30, 2016, subject to automatic renewal each year for an additional one-year period unless either party provides prior written notice of non-renewal. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Littlefield's annual base salary was $800,000 and he was eligible for a target bonus opportunity of 100% of his base salary based on company and individual performance. 
Mr. Littlefield's employment agreement provided that if, within 18 months following a change in control, he was terminated without "cause" or resigns with "good reason," then he would be eligible to receive: (i) accrued obligations, including salary, accrued vacation time and any earned and unpaid bonuses through the termination date; (ii) a pro-rated portion of his target annual cash bonus for the year of termination, based on the number of days elapsed in the performance period prior to the date of termination and payable in a lump sum by January 31 of the year following the year of termination; and (iii) an amount equal to the sum of two times his annual base salary and two times his target annual cash bonus, payable over 12 months following the date of termination. 
In connection with Mr. Littlefield's resignation from the company on December 19, 2018, we entered into the separation agreement, which provided for the satisfaction of all obligations to Mr. Littlefield under the employment agreement. 
Employment Agreements with Messrs. Vigneau, Marhoun and Phelps 
In November 2013, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Marhoun and Mr. Phelps. In January 2014, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Vigneau. 
The employment agreements do not have a fixed term and provide for compensation and benefits at our sole discretion. Under the employment agreements, we may terminate the executive's employment for "cause" at any time. Either we or the executive may terminate the executive's employment (other than in cases of cause, death or disability) by giving the other party three months' written notice. In the event that either party provides notice, for the duration of the three-month notice period, the executive will continue to receive the base salary that he received immediately prior to the notice and will continue to be eligible for benefits. Except as provided below, the executive will not be eligible for any bonus (either in full or pro rata) otherwise payable after the date on which notice is given, nor be eligible for any benefits after the termination date. Upon a termination of employment, the executive will have the right to elect continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA") at his expense. 
Under any termination, the executive will be entitled to salary, accrued and unused vacation time and accrued benefits through the termination date. Upon a termination by us other than for "cause," provided the executive signs and delivers, and does not revoke, a general release in a form acceptable to us, the executive will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits in a lump sum following the expiration of any revocation period in the release agreement: (i) severance payment equal to two weeks of base salary for every year of employment (counting service to the predecessor entity and its affiliates), subject to a minimum payment of 26 weeks of base salary (39 weeks of base salary in the  case of Mr. Phelps) and a maximum payment of 52 weeks of base salary; and (ii) if the executive properly elects COBRA coverage, we will make payments to the insurance provider equal to the amount due for the executive's COBRA coverage payments for a period of time equal to the number of weeks of severance payments (or, if sooner, until the executive is eligible to receive health benefits under another medical plan). 
Upon a termination for disability, the executive will receive a pro rata bonus for the period when the executive was performing his or her regular duties on a full-time basis. Upon the executive's death, the executive's estate shall be eligible to receive the executive's bonus, if any, for the period up through the executive's death (and in the event the executive's death is prior to the end of a compensation year, the bonus will be prorated). 
The employment agreements generally define "cause" as (i) the executive's breach of his obligations under the employment agreement; (ii) the executive's failure to perform duties assigned to him in a manner satisfactory to the company; (iii) the executive's engagement in acts of dishonesty or moral turpitude, or any unlawful conduct; or (iv) the executive's engagement in conduct that is likely to affect adversely the company's business or reputation. 
Under the employment agreements, during the executive's employment and for 18 months following any termination of employment, the executive is subject to a non-solicitation covenant related to clients and employees. In addition, during employment and for six months following any termination of employment, each executive is subject to a non-competition restrictive covenant under the employment agreements.

(4)  Amounts reported in this column were not reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation  tables for previous years.  
[END TABLE]
The Deferred Compensation Plan permits our participating NEOs and certain other employees to elect to defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of any performance-based non-equity incentive plan compensation. Any deferral elections are made under the Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to a participation agreement with the NEO. We have eliminated the annual discretionary grant to each active participating NEO effective January 2013. Past employer contributions vest 20% for each year of service and are fully vested after five years of service. Deferred amounts and employer contributions are contributed to individual accounts in the FGLH Executive Deferred Compensation Plan Trust. The participants self-direct the notional investment of deferred contribution accounts in investment funds from a selection made available by our retirement committee. 
The vested balance of the deferred compensation accounts will be distributed to each participating NEO upon his or her death, disability or separation from service (including retirement). Participants may elect upon initial enrollment to have accounts distributed upon a change in control event, although none of our NEOs have so elected. In-service hardship and education account withdrawals are permitted under the plan with respect to participant deferrals and employer credits.  Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Effect of Termination or Change in Control on Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
For any participating NEO in our deferred compensation plan, the vested balance of the deferred compensation accounts will be distributed upon death, disability or separation from service, and, if elected upon initial enrollment, upon a change-in-control event. None of our participating NEOs have elected to have vested account balances distributed upon a change-in-control event without a separation from service. For more information on our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, see the narrative description entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
2015 Severance Plan 
On June 16, 2015, FGL's Compensation Committee authorized amendments to its severance benefit policies, including the adoption of the Severance Plan. Under the terms of the Severance Plan, Mr. Vigneau, Mr. Marhoun, Mr. Phelps and Mr. Currier are eligible to receive severance payments and benefits if, within 12 months following a change in control, (a) the NEO is terminated without "cause" or (b) the NEO's position is eliminated, the NEO is not offered "comparable employment" and the NEO voluntarily terminates employment as a result. Upon such a qualifying termination of employment, the NEO will generally be eligible to receive: (i) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) 52 weeks of the NEO's base salary, (y) the NEO's target annual cash bonus and (z) a pro-rated portion of the NEO's target annual cash bonus for the year of termination, based on the number of days elapsed in the performance period prior to the date of termination, generally payable in a lump sum within approximately four weeks after the NEO returns a release of claims to the company; and (ii) subsidized health and medical insurance coverage under COBRA for 52 weeks following the date of termination. 
The Severance Plan provides that if payments, whether under the Severance Plan or otherwise, would be subject to the excise tax imposed on "parachute payments" in accordance with Section 280G of the Code, then those payments will be reduced to the extent necessary such that no portion of the payments is subject to the excise tax, but only if the net amount of such payments, as so reduced, is greater than or equal to the net amount of such payments without such reduction. 
For purposes of the Severance Plan, "cause" has the meaning set forth in the individual NEO's employment agreement with the company, under which cause generally means: (i) breach of the executive officer's obligations under his or her employment agreement; (ii) failure to perform duties in a manner satisfactory to the company, subject to the obligation of the company to provide the executive officer with prior notice providing reasonable detail of the bases for the unsatisfactory performance and an opportunity to correct the performance deficiencies; (iii) engaging in acts of dishonesty or moral turpitude, or any unlawful conduct; or (iv) engaging in conduct that is likely to affect adversely the business and or reputation of the company. 
For purposes of the Severance Plan, "comparable employment" generally means: (i) a reduction in base salary by of more than 15%; (ii) a reduction in target annual bonus of more than 15%; and (iii) a relocation of primary worksite, which is more than 50 miles from the primary worksite at the time of the change in control.  Potential Payments Table 
The following table sets forth the estimated amount of compensation each of our NEOs would receive under the termination or change in control provisions contained in the agreements and plans discussed above. For our NEOs other than Mr. Littlefield, the table assumes that such termination or change in control event occurred on December 31, 2018. For Mr. Littlefield, the table includes only the actual amounts paid in connection with his resignation from the company on December 19, 2018. The table excludes (i) amounts accrued through the termination date that would be paid in the normal course of continued employment, such as accrued but unpaid salary, (ii) vested account balances under our 401(k) plan that are generally available to all of our employees and (iii) except as indicated in the footnotes below, any post-employment benefit that is available to all of our employees and does not discriminate in favor of our NEOs. In the case of a change in control situation, we assume that the vesting of all options and restricted stock will be accelerated, even though our Compensation Committee has the discretion to provide for alternative treatment of the awards upon a change in control.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our Audit Committee has approved the engagement of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019. Our Board and Audit Committee believes that the appointment of KPMG as our company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of our shareholders and our company. 
Although shareholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by any applicable law or regulation, shareholder views are being solicited and will be considered by our Audit Committee and our Board. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and its shareholders. We expect that a representative of KPMG will be present at our annual meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and to be available to answer appropriate questions. 
To the company's knowledge, neither KPMG nor any of its partners has any direct financial interest or any indirect financial interest in our company other than as the company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
For information about the professional services rendered by KPMG to us for fiscal 2018, please see the section of this proxy statement captioned "Principal Accountant Fees and Services."

 Changes in the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
On November 29, 2017, in connection with the Closing, WithumSmith+Brown, PC ("Withum") resigned as the company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of the closing date of the Business Combination. The report of Withum on the company's financial statements for the period from February 26, 2016 (date of inception) to December 31, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the period from February 26, 2016 (date of inception) to December 31, 2016, and in the subsequent interim period through November 29, 2017, (i) there were no "disagreements" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) between CF Corp. or the company and Withum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Withum, would have caused Withum to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its reports and (ii) there were no "reportable events" within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The company provided Withum with a copy of the disclosures set forth above and requested that Withum furnish the company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of Withum's letter, dated December 1, 2017, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 1, 2017.
On November 29, 2017, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of KPMG as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Prior to the completion of the Business Combination, KPMG served as the auditor of FGL since its initial public offering. KPMG accepted the engagement on January 5, 2018. 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, and the subsequent interim period through November 29, 2017, neither the company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with KPMG regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the company that KPMG concluded was an important factor considered by the company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a "reportable event" (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
In accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley, our Audit Committee charter provides that our Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to pre-approve all audit services, audit-related tax services and other permitted services to be performed for our company by our independent registered public accounting firm and the related fees. Pursuant to its charter and in compliance with rules of the SEC and the PCAOB, our Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy and procedures that require the pre-approval of all services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm may be considered for other services not specifically approved as audit services or audit-related services and tax services so long as the services are not prohibited by SEC or PCAOB rules and would not otherwise impair the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm.  The table below sets forth the professional fees billed or expected to be billed to our company by KPMG for professional services rendered during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our Audit Committee operates under, and has the responsibility and authority set forth in, the written charter adopted by our Board of Directors, which can be viewed on our website, www.fglife.bm under "Corporate Governance." As described above, all members of our Audit Committee are independent as defined by SEC rules and NYSE Corporate Governance Standards. Each member is financially literate within the meaning of NYSE Corporate Governance Standards and at least one member of our Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. 
Management is responsible for our internal controls and the financial reporting process. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and for auditing the company's internal control over financial reporting and issuing their reports thereon. Our Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the audited financial statements of FGL Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the accounting firm's independence. Our Audit Committee has concluded that KPMG's provision of audit and non-audit services to our company and its affiliates is compatible with KPMG's independence. 
Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also appointed KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

The proposal must also comply with all applicable statutes and regulations. 
Our charter provides that, except in the case of proposals made in accordance with Rule 14a-8, shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual general meeting or nominations of persons for election as directors are subject to the advance notice procedures in our charter (the "Advance Notice Procedures"). To be considered timely under the Advance Notice Procedures, notice of a shareholder proposal or director nomination (a "Shareholder Notice") for the 2020 annual general meeting must be delivered to our principal executive offices at 4th Floor, Boundary Hall, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands KY1-1102 no later than February 6, 2020.

To be eligible to submit a proposal or nominee under the Advance Notice Procedures, the shareholder must meet the eligibility requirements to submit shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 and must be entitled to vote on such proposal or for the election of directors, as applicable. All shareholder proposals and director nominations under the Advance Notice Procedures must comply with all requirements under our charter. This includes that the Shareholder Notice must be in the proper written form as required by our charter, and in the case of a director nomination, a written questionnaire, written representation and agreement and other information requested by the Company of the person nominated will be required. Director nominations may only be for such classes or slates as are specified in company's notice of meeting as being up for election at such annual general meeting. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review all such information submitted by the shareholder with respect to the proposed nominee and determine whether such nominee is eligible to act as a director. All shareholder proposals or director nominations under our Advance Notice Procedures must comply with all applicable statutes, regulations and requirements in our charter, a copy of which may be obtained at no cost from the corporate secretary. 
If the chairman of any annual meeting determines that a shareholder proposal or nomination does not comply with the requirements set forth in our charter, such matter shall be disregarded.

Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name." If you are a beneficial owner of your shares, you must contact the broker or other nominee holding your shares and follow its instructions for changing your vote. 
Quorum 
We may hold our annual meeting only if a "quorum" is present, either in person or by proxy. A quorum will be present at the annual meeting if the holders of a majority of the issued shares being individuals present in person or by proxy or if a corporation or other non-natural person by its duly authorized representative or proxy are present. Your shares will be counted towards establishing a quorum if you vote by mail, over the Internet or if you vote in person at our annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If a quorum is not present at our annual meeting, we may adjourn the annual meeting to the same day in the next week at the same time and/or place or to such other day, time and/or place as the board may determine. 
Voting Requirements 
You may either vote for, against or abstain on each of the proposals. The election of each director nominee under Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 2 (ratification of the appointment of KPMG as auditor) each require an ordinary resolution, which is a resolution passed by holders of a simple majority of the issued and outstanding shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the annual meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not affect the outcome of any of the Proposals, as they are not counted as votes cast. 
Shareholders of record. If you are a record holder of shares and you do not give specific voting instructions, the proxy holders will vote your shares as recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement, and as the proxy holders determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at our annual meeting. 
Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name." If your shares are held in "street name" and you do not give specific voting instructions to your nominee, then, under the NYSE rules, your nominee generally may vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. Only the proposal regarding ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is considered routine under applicable rules. If you do not give instructions on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, your nominee will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares; this is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Inspector of Election 
We have engaged Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as our independent inspector of election to tabulate shareholder votes at our annual meeting.  Cost of Proxy Solicitation 
This proxy is solicited on behalf of our Board. Certain officers, directors and other employees may also solicit proxies on our behalf by mail, telephone, fax, Internet or in person. Our company is paying for the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing this proxy soliciting material. We will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. Brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians have been requested to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of common shares held of record by them, and these custodians will be reimbursed for their reasonable charges and expenses to forward our proxy materials to their customers or principals. 
Voting Results 
We will publish the final voting results from our annual meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the date of our annual meeting. 
Householding Information 
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of our proxy materials to any household at which two or more shareholders reside if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if shareholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our proxy materials at the same address this year or in future years, the shareholders should follow the instructions described below. We will promptly provide separate copies upon written or oral request. Similarly, if an address is shared with another shareholder and together both of the shareholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the shareholders should follow these instructions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the shares are registered in the name of the shareholder, the shareholder should contact our  transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, at 1 State Street, 30th Floor, New York, NY 10004-1561 or 212.509.4000 or us at our principal executive offices at 4th Floor, Boundary Hall, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman  Islands KY1-1102 or 410.487.8898 to inform us of his or her request; or
