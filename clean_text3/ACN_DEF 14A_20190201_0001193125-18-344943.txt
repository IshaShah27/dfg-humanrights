Advancing Inclusion & Diversity 
Our commitment to inclusion and diversity is unwavering and we embrace diversity as a source of innovation, creativity and competitive advantage. We strive to create a truly human environment where people experience a real sense of belonging, and where they can be who they are, and be their best, professionally and personally. 
We are making progress on our path to achieving a gender-balanced workforce by 2025. At the end of fiscal 2018, approximately 42 percent of our people were women, up from 36 percent in 2014. Additionally, we strive to ensure that all our people—women and men—are compensated fairly and equitably from the moment we hire them through the milestones of their careers here. When we see a disparity for any of our people—women or men—we fix it. 
COMPENSATION PRACTICES (page 36) 
The Compensation Committee oversees the design and administration of the Company's compensation programs. The Compensation Committee believes that a well-designed, consistently applied compensation program is fundamental to the long-term creation of shareholder value. The following table summarizes some highlights of our compensation practices that drive our named executive officer compensation programs:

Our compensation program is designed to reward executives for their overall contribution to Company performance, including the Company's execution against its business plan and the creation of shareholder value, and to provide executives with an incentive to continue to expand their contributions to Accenture. The following reflects the mix of pay for our chairman and chief executive officer, Pierre Nanterme, for fiscal 2018 performance:

The Compensation Committee believes that total realizable compensation for the Company's named executive officers should be closely aligned with the Company's performance and each individual's performance. As the graph below shows, the Company's performance with respect to total shareholder return over a 3-year period was at the 76th percentile among the companies in our peer group. The realizable total direct compensation for our chairman and chief executive officer was in the 62nd percentile, which indicates that pay and performance are aligned. See page 37 for a definition of realizable total direct compensation.

LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Pierre Nanterme, our chief executive officer, also serves as the chairman of our Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the same person holds the chief executive officer and chairman roles or if the chairman is not independent, the independent directors of the Board will designate one of the independent directors to serve as the lead director. Marjorie Magner has served as our independent lead director since January 31, 2014. The Board has determined that the presence of our independent lead director who, as described below, has meaningful oversight responsibilities, together with a strong leader in the combined role of chairman and chief executive officer, serves the best interests of Accenture and its shareholders at this time. The Board believes that in light of Mr. Nanterme's knowledge of Accenture and our industry, which has been built up over 35 years of experience with the Company, he is well positioned to serve as both chairman and chief executive officer of the Company. 
LEAD DIRECTOR; EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
The lead director helps ensure there is an appropriate balance between management and the independent directors and that the independent directors are fully informed and able to discuss and debate the issues that they deem important. The responsibilities of the lead director, which are described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, include, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Agendas    Providing input on issues for Board consideration, helping set and approving the Board agenda, ensuring  that adequate information is provided to the Board, helping ensure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items and approving schedules for Board meetings.

[END TABLE]
The Board believes that one of the key elements of effective, independent oversight is that the independent directors meet in executive session on a regular basis without the presence of management. Accordingly, our independent directors meet separately in executive session at each regularly scheduled in-person Board meeting. Our independent directors held 4 executive sessions during fiscal 2018, all of which were led by the lead director. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
The Board has adopted categorical standards designed to assist the Board in assessing director independence (the "Independence Standards"), which are included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Independence Standards have been designed to comply with the standards required by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the Board shall perform an annual review of the independence of all directors and nominees and that the Board shall affirmatively determine that, to be considered independent, a director must not have any direct or indirect material relationship with Accenture. In addition, committee members are subject to any additional independence requirements that may be required by applicable law, regulation or NYSE listing standards. 
In making its independence recommendations, the Nominating & Governance Committee evaluates the various commercial, charitable and employment transactions and relationships known to the committee that exist between us and our subsidiaries and the directors and the entities with which certain of our directors or members of their immediate families are, or have been, affiliated (including those identified through our annual directors' questionnaires). Furthermore, the Nominating & Governance Committee discusses other relevant facts and circumstances regarding the nature of these transactions and relationships to determine whether other factors, regardless of the Independence Standards, might compromise a director's independence. 
Based on its analysis, the Nominating & Governance Committee recommended, and the Board determined that, other than Pierre Nanterme, each of our directors (Jaime Ardila, Charles H. Giancarlo, Herbert Hainer, Marjorie Magner, Nancy McKinstry, Gilles C. Pélisson, Paula A. Price, Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, Arun Sarin, Frank K. Tang and Tracey T. Travis) is independent under all applicable standards, including those applicable to committee service. The Board concurred in these recommendations. In reaching its determinations, the Nominating & Governance Committee and the Board considered the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During fiscal 2018, Charles H. Giancarlo, Nancy McKinstry, Gilles C. Pélisson, Paula A. Price, Venkata (Murthy)  Renduchintala and Tracey T. Travis were employed by organizations that do business with Accenture. The amount received by Accenture or such other organization in each of the last three fiscal years did not exceed the greater of $1 million or 1%  of either Accenture's or such organization's consolidated gross revenues.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of Ms. Price and Ms. Travis is a director of a non-profit  organization to which Accenture made charitable contributions of less than $120,000 during fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition, the Board determined that William L. Kimsey, who was not subject to  re-appointment at the 2018 Annual Meeting, was independent during the period he served on the Board during fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT 
The Board is responsible for providing governance and oversight regarding the strategy, operations and management of Accenture. Acting as a full Board and through the Board's 4 standing committees, the Board is involved in the Company's strategic planning process. Each year, the Board holds a strategy retreat during which members of Accenture Leadership present the Company's overall corporate strategy and seek input from the Board. At subsequent meetings, the Board continues to review the Company's progress against its strategic plan. In addition, throughout the year, the Board will review specific strategic initiatives where the Board will provide additional oversight. The Board is continuously engaged in providing oversight and independent business judgment on the strategic issues that are most important to the Company. 
RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") program. As described more fully below, the Board fulfills this responsibility both directly and through its standing committees, each of which assists the Board in overseeing a part of the Company's overall risk management. 
The Company's chief operating officer, who is a member of our global management committee and reports to our chief executive officer, coordinates the Company's ERM program. The responsibility for managing each of the highest-priority risks is assigned to one or more members of our global management committee. The Company's ERM program is designed to identify, assess and manage the Company's risk exposures. As part of its ERM program, the Company:

In that regard, the  Board receives quarterly reports from the chairs of each of the Board's committees, which include updates when appropriate, with respect to the risks overseen by the respective committees. In addition, the chief operating officer briefs  the Board annually and provides a detailed review of the Company's ERM program, including the annual risk assessment process, program scope and status of priority risks, among other things. The committees of the Board oversee specific  areas of the Company's risk management, which are described below.

 The Audit Committee reviews our guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment  and management and our major financial risk exposures, along with the monitoring and control of these exposures. As needed, the committee reviews the risks believed to be the most important and, at a minimum, the chief operating officer provides the  Audit Committee an annual review of the ERM program as a whole. The Audit Committee also discusses with the chairs of the Finance and Compensation Committees the risk assessment process for the risks overseen by those committees on at least an  annual basis.

As described above, the Board actively oversees a number of risks, which include cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee, which is responsible for risk oversight, is continually updated by the chief operating officer regarding ERM, including cybersecurity concerns and the Company's approach to managing cybersecurity risks. The chief information security officer also regularly presents to the Audit Committee regarding cybersecurity. 
BOARD MEETINGS 
During fiscal 2018, the Board held 5 meetings, 4 of which were held in person. The Board expects that its members will rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in all Board and applicable committee meetings and each annual general meeting of shareholders. Directors are also expected to become familiar with Accenture's organization, management team and operations in connection with discharging their oversight responsibilities. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   During fiscal  2018, all of our incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which they served, except for Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, who joined our Board in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.      ◥

DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS 
All of our Board members who served on the Board at the time of our 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders attended that meeting. 
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD 
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Finance Committee and a Nominating & Governance Committee. From time to time, the Board may also create ad hoc or special committees for certain purposes in addition to these 4 standing committees. Each committee consists entirely of independent, non-employee directors. The charter of each committee provides that non-management directors who are not members of such committee may nonetheless attend the meeting of that committee, but may not vote. The table below lists the current membership of each committee and the number of meetings held in fiscal 2018. 
In support of our belief that diversity with respect to committee tenure is important in order to provide for both fresh perspectives and deep experience and knowledge of the Company, in fiscal 2018, Nancy McKinstry rotated from the Audit Committee to the Compensation Committee, and in fiscal 2019, Marjorie Magner was added to the Nominating & Governance Committee.

AUDIT  
COMMITTEE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     The Audit Committee was established by the Board for the purpose of, among other things, overseeing Accentures  accounting and financial reporting processes and audits of our financial statements and internal controls.     ◥     The Audit Committees primary responsibilities include the oversight of the following:    the quality and integrity of the  Companys accounting and reporting practices and controls, and the financial statements and reports of the Company;    the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;    the independent auditors qualifications  and independence; and    the performance of  the Companys internal audit function and independent auditors.   The Board has determined  that each member of the Audit Committee meets the financial literacy and independence requirements of the Securities & Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the NYSE applicable to audit committee members and that each of Jaime  Ardila, Paula A. Price and Tracey T. Travis also qualifies as an audit committee financial expert for purposes of SEC rules. Further, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an independent director  and possesses the requisite competence in accounting or auditing to satisfy the requirements for audit committees required by the Companies Act 2014.   No member of the Audit Committee may serve on the audit committee of more than 3 public companies, including Accenture, unless the Board determines that such  simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such member to effectively serve on the Audit Committee and discloses such determination in accordance with NYSE requirements. No member of the Audit Committee currently serves on the audit  committees of more than 3 public companies, including Accenture.

OVERSIGHT OF COMPENSATION 
A number of individuals and entities contribute to the process of reviewing and determining the compensation of our chairman and chief executive officer, members of our global management committee and directors: 
ROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS 
The Compensation Committee has engaged Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance") to serve as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. Pay Governance and its affiliates do not provide any services to the Company or any of the Company's affiliates other than advising the Compensation Committee on director and executive compensation. With respect to executive compensation, as requested by the Compensation Committee, Pay Governance advises the Compensation Committee on general marketplace trends in executive compensation, makes proposals for executive compensation programs, recommends peer companies for inclusion in competitive market analyses of compensation and otherwise advises the Compensation Committee with regard to the compensation of our chairman and chief executive officer and the members of our global management committee. Pay Governance also provides input for the Compensation Committee to consider regarding the final compensation packages of our chairman and chief executive officer, as discussed under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Process for Determining Executive Compensation." In addition, Pay Governance provides input to the Compensation Committee for its annual review of director compensation, as discussed under "Director Compensation." 
Management separately receives benchmarking information with respect to the members of our global management committee from its compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson plc ("Willis Towers Watson"). This information is based on a benchmarking approach developed by Willis Towers Watson and Pay Governance and is used by the chairman and chief executive officer in making his recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of the members of our global management committee. The Compensation Committee also reviews this report. While Willis Towers Watson also acts as management's compensation consultant in various capacities with respect to our global workforce of approximately 459,000 employees and assists management in formulating its compensation recommendations for members of our global management committee, the Compensation Committee has separately engaged Pay Governance as its independent compensation consultant to provide it with independent advice and to avoid any conflicts of interest. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to the applicable rules and determined that its engagement does not raise any conflict of interest. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written Related Person Transactions Policy, which provides that all related person transactions covered by the policy must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Board or by the Nominating & Governance Committee. The Related Person Transactions Policy applies to any transaction that would be required by the SEC to be disclosed in our proxy statement. 
The Nominating & Governance Committee or the Board, as applicable, will not approve or ratify any related person transaction unless, after considering all relevant information, it has determined that the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and our shareholders and complies with applicable law. In reviewing related person transactions, the Nominating & Governance Committee or the Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction and the material terms of the transaction;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would likely impair the judgment of a director or an executive officer to act in the best interest  of the Company and, in the case of an outside director, whether it would impair his or her independence; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the value and the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and on a substantially similar basis as would  apply if the transaction did not involve a related person.  
[END TABLE]
Certain Related Person Transactions 
From time to time, institutional investors, such as large investment management firms, mutual fund management organizations and other financial organizations, become beneficial owners of 5% or more of our Class A ordinary shares and, as a result, are considered "related persons" under the Related Person Transactions Policy. We may conduct business with these organizations in the ordinary course. During fiscal 2018, the following transactions occurred with investors who reported beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the Company's voting securities. Each of the following transactions was entered into on an arm's-length basis in the ordinary course and in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy described above: 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
We maintain an ongoing, proactive outreach effort with our shareholders. Throughout the year, members of our Investor Relations team and leaders of our business engage with our shareholders to seek their input, to remain well-informed regarding their perspectives and to help increase their understanding of our business. In particular, through the engagement, we leverage the discussions to cover topics of interest to our shareholders, including related to our strategy, compensation, Board and other governance topics. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      This year, as part of our recurring engagement with shareholders, our outreach  included, among other things, discussion around our commitment to corporate citizenship and environmental, social and governance matters. In a combined effort with Investor Relations and our Corporate Citizenship and Legal teams, we reached out  to our top 50 shareholders. The discussions occurred in August through October 2018. The feedback received from our shareholder outreach efforts is communicated to and considered by the Board, and our engagement activities have produced  valuable feedback that helps us inform our decisions and our strategy, when appropriate.             ◥

POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND LOBBYING 
Pursuant to the Company's political contributions and lobbying policy, the Company has a long-standing global policy against making contributions to political parties, political committees or candidates using company resources, even where permitted by law. In the United States, Accenture maintains a political action committee (the "PAC") that is registered with the Federal Election Commission and makes federal political contributions on a bipartisan basis to political parties, political committees and candidates. The contributions made by the PAC are not funded by corporate funds and are fully funded by voluntary contributions made by Accenture Leaders in the United States. The Company does not penalize in any way Accenture Leaders who do not contribute to the PAC. 
In addition, when we determine it is in the best interest of the Company, we work with governments to provide information and perspective that support our point of view, through our lobbyists and grassroots lobbying communications. We disclose our U.S. federal, state and local lobbying activity and expenditures as required by law. The Audit Committee and senior management have oversight over political, lobbying and other grassroots advocacy activities. The Company's political contributions and lobbying policy is available on our website at https://www.accenture.com/us-en/company-political-contributions-policy.

We operate our business as stewards of a more open, connected and inclusive world. Working closely with our people, our clients and our communities, we apply our unique understanding of technology to develop innovative solutions to business and societal challenges.

As required under Irish law and our Articles of Association, the resolution in respect of this Proposal 1 is an ordinary resolution that requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast with respect to each director nominee. 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF 
PROPOSAL 1 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
"By separate resolutions, to re-appoint the following eleven directors: Jaime Ardila; Herbert Hainer; Marjorie Magner; Nancy McKinstry; Pierre Nanterme; Gilles C. Pélisson; Paula A. Price; Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala; Arun Sarin; Frank K. Tang and Tracey T. Travis." 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the re-appointment of each of the Boards director nominees listed above. 
DIRECTOR CHARACTERISTICS AND SUCCESSION PLANNING 
Our Board is committed to regular renewal and refreshment and has continuously enhanced the director recruitment and selection process, resulting in a well-qualified and diverse group of director nominees. As part of that process, the Nominating & Governance Committee regularly reviews the composition of our Board and assesses the skills and characteristics of our directors with a view towards enhancing the composition of our Board to support the Company's evolving strategy. 
Consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating & Governance Committee seeks to ensure that the Board is composed of individuals whose particular backgrounds, skills and expertise, when taken together, will provide the Board with the range of skills and expertise to guide and oversee Accenture's strategy, operations and management. The Nominating & Governance Committee seeks candidates who, at a minimum, have the following characteristics: 
In addition, in light of the skills and expertise of the incumbent directors, the committee assesses the contribution that a particular candidate's skills and expertise will make with respect to guiding and overseeing Accenture's strategy, operations and management. 
BOARD DIVERSITY AND TENURE 
Consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating & Governance Committee also seeks geographic, age, gender and ethnic diversity among the members of the Board. While the Board has not adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Nominating & Governance Committee and the Board believe that considering diversity is consistent with the goal of creating a Board that best serves the needs of the Company and the interests of its shareholders, and it is one of the many factors that they consider when identifying individuals for Board membership. 
In addition, we believe that diversity with respect to tenure is important in order to provide for both fresh perspectives and deep experience and knowledge of the Company. Therefore, we aim to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure across our directors. In furtherance of the Board's active role in Board succession planning, the Board has appointed 7 new directors since 2014. 
Our director nominees reflect those efforts and the importance of diversity to the Board. Of our 11 director nominees:

QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
In considering each director nominee for the Annual Meeting, the Board and the Nominating & Governance Committee evaluated such person's background, qualifications, attributes and skills to serve as a director. The Board and the Nominating & Governance Committee considered the nomination criteria discussed above, as well as the years of experience many directors have had working together on the Board and the deep knowledge of the Company they have developed as a result of such service. The Board and the Nominating & Governance Committee also evaluated each of the director's contributions to the Board and role in the operation of the Board as a whole. 
We believe our director nominees bring a well-rounded variety of experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills, and represent a mix of deep knowledge of the Company and fresh perspectives. The table below summarizes some of the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of our director nominees.

PROCESS FOR SELECTING NEW DIRECTORS 
To identify, recruit and evaluate qualified candidates for the Board, the Board has used the services of professional search firms. In some cases, nominees have been individuals known to Board members or others through business or other relationships. In the case of Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, a third-party professional search firm identified him as a potential director nominee. Prior to his nomination, Dr. Renduchintala also met separately with the chairman and chief executive officer, the chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee and the lead director, who initially considered his candidacy. In addition, the professional search firm retained by the Nominating & Governance Committee verified information about the prospective candidate. A background check was also completed before a final recommendation was made to the Board. Dr. Renduchintala also met separately with other members of the Board, and after review and discussion with each of these directors, the Nominating & Governance Committee recommended, and the Board approved, Dr. Renduchintala's appointment as a director. 
DIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION 
Accenture's orientation program for new directors includes a discussion of a broad range of topics, including the background of the Company, the Board and its governance model, Accenture's strategy and business operations, its financial statements and capital structure, the management team, key industry and competitive factors, the legal and ethical responsibilities of the Board and other matters crucial to the ability of a new director to fulfill his or her responsibilities. Our directors are expected to keep current on issues affecting Accenture and its industry and on developments with respect to their general responsibilities as directors. Accenture will either provide or pay for ongoing director education. 
PROCESS FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO RECOMMEND DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Articles of Association address the processes by which shareholders may recommend director nominees, and the policy of the Nominating & Governance Committee is to welcome and consider any such recommendations. If you would like to recommend a future nominee for Board membership, you can submit a written recommendation in accordance with our Articles of Association and applicable law, including the name and other pertinent information for the nominee, to: Mr. Gilles C. Pélisson, chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee, c/o Accenture, 161 N. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60601, USA, Attention: Corporate Secretary. As provided for in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating & Governance Committee uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates regardless of the source of referral. Please note that Article 84(a)(ii) of our Articles of Association prescribes certain timing and nomination requirements with respect to any such recommendation and Article 84(b) prescribes certain other requirements if an eligible shareholder wishes to have their nominee included in our proxy materials for our annual general meeting (see "Additional Information—Submission of Future Shareholder Proposals" for additional details on how to submit a director nominee for our 2020 annual general meeting).

   (1)  Each of our  independent directors may elect to receive the annual retainer and other retainers in the form of cash, entirely in the form of restricted share units (RSUs) or one-half in cash and one-half in RSUs. Grants of RSUs to our directors are fully vested on the date of grant, and future delivery of the underlying shares is not dependent on a directors continued service. Directors are entitled  to a proportional number of additional RSUs on outstanding awards if we pay a dividend. The underlying shares for RSU awards granted in fiscal 2018 will be delivered 1 year after the grant date; directors may not further delay delivery of the  shares. Newly appointed directors also receive an initial award of fully-vested RSUs valued at approximately $200,000 upon appointment to the Board.

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Under the federal securities laws, our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of Accenture plc's Class A ordinary shares or Class X ordinary shares are required within a prescribed period of time to report to the SEC transactions and holdings in such shares. Based solely on a review of the copies of these forms received by us and on written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5 was required to be filed, we believe that during fiscal 2018 all of these filing requirements were satisfied in a timely manner. 
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
To our knowledge, except as otherwise indicated, each of the persons listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by him or her. For purposes of the table below, "beneficial ownership" is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), pursuant to which a person is deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of any shares that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days after December 3, 2018. For purposes of computing the percentage of outstanding shares held by each person or group of persons named below, any shares that such person or group of persons has the right to acquire within 60 days after December 3, 2018 are deemed to be outstanding but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person or group of persons. 
The following beneficial ownership table sets forth, as of December 3, 2018, information regarding the beneficial ownership of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares held by: (1) each of our directors and named executive officers; and (2) all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.

PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE 
The Compensation Committee believes that total compensation for the Company's named executive officers should closely align with the Company's performance and each individual's performance. We use 3 broad themes to tie pay to performance for our named executive officers: driving growth by helping Accenture's clients become high performance businesses; educating, energizing and inspiring Accenture's people; and running Accenture as a high performance business. 
Our named executive officers are eligible for a cash bonus award under our Global Annual Bonus program, which rewards them for Company and individual performance based on the achievement of numerous measures organized within these three broad themes. We also use 2 primary equity compensation programs for our named executive officers: the Key Executive Performance Share Program, which rewards achievement over a future 3-year performance period, and the Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program, which rewards executives for performance in the preceding fiscal year.

 When setting compensation, the Committee considers the Companys performance and compensation earned over a multi-year period, in each case,  relative to our peer group. As the graph below shows, the Companys performance with respect to total shareholder return over a 3-year period was at the 76th percentile among  the companies in our peer group as of August 31, 2018. The realizable total direct compensation for Accentures chairman and chief executive officer was at the 62nd percentile, which indicates that pay and  performance are aligned.

SAY-ON-PAY VOTE

      Each year, the Compensation Committee considers the outcome of the shareholder  advisory vote on executive compensation when making future decisions relating to the compensation of our named executive officers and our executive compensation program and policies. Shareholders continued to show strong support of our executive  compensation programs, with approximately 95% of the votes cast for the approval of the say-on-pay proposal at our 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders. Given this strong support, which we believe demonstrates our  shareholders satisfaction with the alignment of our named executive officers compensation with the Companys performance, the Compensation Committee determined not to implement any significant changes to our compensation programs in  fiscal 2018 as a result of the shareholder advisory vote.               ◥

PROCESS FOR DETERMINING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee evaluates overall Company performance for a fiscal year by reviewing the results achieved against the performance objectives for the year in the context of the overall performance of the market (as discussed below under "—Performance Objectives Used in Evaluations") and then determining whether the Company exceeded, met or partially met the objectives as a whole for the year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
In October 2018, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Messrs. Nanterme and Rowland, assessed the overall Company performance for fiscal 2018. In assessing overall Company performance, the  Compensation Committee focused on those aspects of the Companys performance reflected in the results discussed above. In making its determination, the Compensation Committee considered the Companys very strong performance in fiscal 2018,  sustained broad-based growth and continued execution of its strategy over multiple years. In addition, the Compensation Committee considered the Companys leadership in key markets as it continued to invest significantly in our business. The  Compensation Committee also specifically acknowledged the Companys successful execution of its strategic objectives, significant milestones achieved and the external recognition the Company received for its achievements across a variety of  categories.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's determination of the Company's performance rating is then used as one of the key factors in setting the amounts of compensation that the named executive officers receive for each of the performance elements of compensation described below. In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee took into account the individual performance rating for the chairman and chief executive officer it set together with the Nominating & Governance Committee and the individual performance ratings for the other named executive officers. 
Performance Objectives Used in Evaluations 
As discussed above, individual performance-based compensation is determined by evaluating performance against annual objectives, with no single objective being material to an individual's overall performance evaluation. The objectives for fiscal 2018 were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year and served as one of the components against which the Compensation Committee, together with the Nominating & Governance Committee, considered Mr. Nanterme's performance for fiscal 2018. These included financial objectives that were established at the beginning of the year by reference to annual fiscal-year performance targets set for Accenture with respect to revenue growth in local currency, operating margin, earnings per share, new bookings and free cash flow, as well as other non-financial objectives, as described below. After these company-wide performance objectives were determined by the Compensation Committee for Mr. Nanterme, relevant portions were then incorporated into the performance objectives of the other named executive officers. Each other named executive officer may also have additional objectives specific to his or her role. We believe that encouraging our named executive officers, as well as other employees with management responsibility, to focus on a variety of performance objectives that are important for creating shareholder value reduces the incentive to take excessive risk with respect to any single objective. 
The Compensation Committee, together with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with respect to Mr. Nanterme, and Mr. Nanterme, with respect to the other named executive officers, evaluated the annual performance of, and issued an individual performance rating for, each of the named executive officers for fiscal 2018, by assessing whether they exceeded, met or partially met their performance objectives for the year. The individual performance rating and evaluation were used by Mr. Nanterme in connection with setting his recommendations to the Compensation Committee for each of the other named executive officers' fiscal 2018 performance-based compensation. The Company does not apply a formula or use a pre-determined weighting when comparing overall performance against the various objectives, and no single objective is material in determining individual performance. 
The named executive officers' performance is evaluated against numerous measures organized within 3 broad themes—driving growth by helping Accenture's clients become high performance businesses; educating, energizing and inspiring Accenture's people; and running Accenture as a high performance business—and includes evaluations of the following:

FISCAL 2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
Summaries of the processes undertaken and the compensation decisions made by the Compensation Committee in October 2018 for our chairman and chief executive officer and the other named executive officers of the Company are described below. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
At a meeting in October 2018, the Compensation Committee, together with the Nominating & Governance Committee, set Mr. Nanterme's individual performance rating for fiscal 2018 at a level consistent with the overall Company performance rating, which was in the "exceeds" category. In making this determination, the committees took into account the Company's very strong performance for fiscal 2018, Mr. Nanterme's leadership and the impact that he had on the Company's performance, as well as his performance against a set of performance "objectives," some of which were Company-based performance objectives, as described above under "—Process for Determining Executive Compensation." The committees also took into account feedback solicited by our chief leadership & human resources officer from members of our global management committee and other senior leaders. In evaluating performance against the objectives, no formula or pre-determined weighting was used, and no one objective was individually material. Mr. Nanterme was not present during the committees' review of his performance. 
At a subsequent meeting, the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant discussed market trends and reviewed a chief executive officer pay benchmarking report and the pay-for-performance report discussed below under "—Role of Benchmarking." As part of this review, when setting Mr. Nanterme's final 2018 compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the Company's performance results for fiscal 2018; sustained historical performance results achieved over multiple years; external market references (including absolute and relative performance against peers); internal compensation references; and the leadership role of Mr. Nanterme. Mr. Nanterme was not involved in setting his compensation and was not present during the Compensation Committee's review of his compensation. 
As a result of its fiscal 2018 assessments and consideration of data provided by its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee approved the following compensation elements for Mr. Nanterme set out below:

Named Executive Officers Other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
In determining the fiscal 2018 compensation of the other named executive officers, Mr. Nanterme submitted a recommendation to the Compensation Committee for the overall compensation of each of these officers for the committee's review, discussion and approval. In making these recommendations, Mr. Nanterme considered the following 4 factors: 
Individual contribution and leadership of each named executive officer were measured against the relevant portions of the performance "objectives" as described above in "—Process for Determining Executive Compensation—Performance Objectives Used in Evaluations." Management and the Compensation Committee believe that this approach reflects that the leadership team is collectively responsible for a broad range of Company results and initiatives. In evaluating performance against the objectives, no formula or pre-determined weighting was used, and no one objective was individually material. 
Mr. Nanterme discussed with the Compensation Committee the leadership role and performance of each of the other named executive officers. For the other named executive officers, to the extent applicable, Mr. Nanterme also discussed with the Compensation Committee the financial results of the businesses for which they were responsible. In developing his recommendations to the Compensation Committee for the compensation of such named executive officers, Mr. Nanterme considered information on market-comparable compensation provided by Willis Towers Watson. Before making the final compensation decisions for the year, the Compensation Committee reviewed the recommendations of Mr. Nanterme. 
Based upon Mr. Nanterme's recommendations, the Compensation Committee's assessment of each of the other named executive officers' fiscal 2018 performance and their upcoming responsibilities, and the other considerations described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committee approved the following compensation elements for the other named executive officers:

Role of Benchmarking 
To support the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, performs extensive analyses focusing on executive compensation trends, compensation opportunity, total realizable pay, the difficulty of achieving incentive plan goals, pay-for-performance alignment and compensation levels of chief executive officers across our peer group companies. The Compensation Committee considers these analyses when determining the compensation of our named executive officers, including the chairman and chief executive officer. 
In addition, the Company's compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, prepares a report that includes a comparison of our named executive officers' compensation to comparable roles within our proxy peer group companies, as well as the most recent available published survey data for similar roles across broader industry benchmarks. The Willis Towers Watson report serves as one input to consider along with company and individual performance, internal comparisons across our global management committee and alignment with our professional services compensation philosophy. 
Because the future performance of neither the Company nor the companies in our peer group are known at the time that the compensation opportunities under the Company's programs are established, the Compensation Committee also considers an annual review of the most recent historical alignment of pay and performance relative to the Company's peers. This review is intended to help the Compensation Committee ensure that the Company aligns pay and performance relative to its peers and that our compensation programs are working as intended. The results of the review with respect to all of our named executive officers are summarized under "—Pay-for-Performance" above.

The Compensation Committee reviews and approves a peer group for use in conducting competitive market analyses of compensation for our named executive officers. We do not believe many companies compete directly with us in all lines of our business. However, the Compensation Committee identifies a peer group of relevant public companies for which data are available that are comparable to the Company in at least some areas of our business. Our peer group includes companies that have one or more of the following attributes, which were considered in the screening process to identify appropriate peers: 
The Compensation Committee believes the grouping below provides a meaningful gauge of current pay practices and levels as well as overall compensation trends among companies engaged in the different aspects of the Company's business.

Cash Compensation 
Cash compensation for Accenture's named executive officers consists of 2 components: base compensation and the Global Annual Bonus, each of which is described below. 
Base Compensation 
Base compensation provides a fixed level of compensation to the named executive officers each year and reflects the named executive officer's leadership role, as opposed to individual performance. Base compensation may vary for named executive officers based on relative market compensation. Increases to base compensation, if any, generally take effect at the beginning of the compensation year, which begins on December 1 of each year. 
Global Annual Bonus 
The Global Annual Bonus is designed to tie pay to both individual and Company performance. Funds are accrued during the fiscal year based on Company financial performance, compared to the earnings and profitability targets for the year. Final overall funding decisions are made at the end of the fiscal year based primarily upon the Company's performance against these targets and are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. Once the program's Company-wide funding for the year is finalized, individual payout is determined based on each eligible employee's career level within the Company and individual performance rating. Payments for fiscal 2018 under this program are generally made in November through January depending on country of employment. The program is designed to give higher bonuses to top performers and to provide higher incentives as employees advance through our career levels. All members of Accenture Leadership (approximately 6,700 employees), in addition to our named executive officers, are generally eligible for the Global Annual Bonus. 
Each of the named executive officers was assigned an annual target opportunity range that is a percentage of his or her base compensation. For Mr. Nanterme, this percentage ranged from zero to 350% of base compensation (for fiscal 2019, the range was increased to zero to 500%). For Mr. Rowland, this percentage ranged from zero to 175% of base compensation (for fiscal 2019, the range was increased to zero to 200%). For the other named executive officers, this percentage ranged from zero to 145% of base compensation. A named executive officer may earn more or less than his or her target award based upon the Company's overall funding of the bonus pool under the plan and his or her individual annual performance rating, subject to a cap on the maximum payout. The Compensation Committee took the Company's very strong performance in fiscal 2018 into consideration in approving an overall funding percentage for the Global Annual Bonus that was substantially funded. 
Long-Term Equity Compensation 
Our long-term equity compensation aligns the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders. The Company intends for long-term equity compensation to constitute the most significant component of the compensation opportunity for the named executive officers. The Company offers all of its equity grants in the form of RSUs, which are subject to performance and/or time vesting requirements. With respect to fiscal 2018, equity compensation awards for our named executive officers were granted under the following 3 separate programs, which encourage retention and align the interests of eligible participants with our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Our long-term equity compensation programs are part of a larger framework of compensation for all of our employees. As individuals assume more senior roles at the Company, they become eligible for additional equity compensation programs. As described above, our named executive officers and members of the global management committee are eligible for awards that are intended to reward their individual performance, align their pay with achievement of both annual and long-term performance goals and encourage them to acquire meaningful ownership stakes in Accenture. 
Key Executive Performance Share Program 
The Key Executive Performance Share Program is the primary program under which the Compensation Committee grants RSUs to the named executive officers and members of our global management committee and is intended to be the most significant single element of our named executive officers' compensation over time. The program rewards these individuals for driving the Company's business to meet performance objectives related to 2 metrics: operating income results and relative total shareholder return, in each case over a 3-year period. For grants made with respect to fiscal 2018, the Company continued its approach of weighting operating income results more heavily than total shareholder return. The compensation opportunity under these grants will be based on performance weighted 75% on cumulative operating income results and 25% on cumulative relative total shareholder return, in each case over a 3-year period. This approach recognizes that operating income more accurately reflects the Company's performance against its objectives. Vesting of grants under the program depends on Accenture's cumulative performance against these metrics over the 3-year period. The Company believes this is important because it aligns a significant portion of the named executive officers' realizable total direct compensation against performance over an extended period. For example, a period of poor performance against the Company's operating income or relative total shareholder return targets could affect the ultimate vesting percentage for several years of RSU grants made to the named executive officers under this program. The Company also believes linking compensation to long-term Company performance encourages prudent risk management and discourages excessive risk taking for short-term gain. 
Based on the Company's cumulative operating income and relative total shareholder return for the 3-year period from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018, the 2016 Key Executive Performance Share Program awards vested at 116.2% of the target level (see also "—Narrative Supplement to Summary Compensation Table and to Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table—Key Executive Performance Share Program" below). 
Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program 
The Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program, for which all members of Accenture Leadership are eligible, is designed to recognize and reward high-performing members of Accenture Leadership for their performance in the most recently completed fiscal year and is funded based on overall Company performance. High-performing members of Accenture Leadership receive equity grants in the form of time-vesting RSUs based on their annual performance rating, which awards will vest in equal installments over a 3-year period with shortened vesting schedules applicable to participants who are age 50 or older. Each of the named executive officers is eligible for grants under this program based on his or her annual performance rating for fiscal 2018. The number of RSUs granted to members of Accenture Leadership under this program may also be adjusted based on Company performance. 
Voluntary Equity Investment Program 
The Voluntary Equity Investment Program is a matching program that further encourages share ownership among all members of Accenture Leadership, who may designate up to 30% of their cash compensation to make monthly purchases of Accenture shares. Total contributions from all participating members of Accenture Leadership under this program may be limited at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Following the end of the program year, participants who continue to be employed are awarded a 50% matching RSU grant that generally vests 2 years later, which enables members of Accenture Leadership to receive 1 RSU for every 2 shares they purchased during the year, provided they do not sell or transfer the purchased shares prior to the matching grant date (see also "—Narrative Supplement to Summary Compensation Table and to Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below). 
Other Compensation 
Consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy, the Company provides only limited personal benefits to the named executive officers. Like many of our peer companies and consistent with local market practices, these include premiums paid on life insurance policies, tax-return preparation services, and for Mr. Nanterme, the use of an automobile and driver, which Mr. Nanterme uses for security purposes and to maximize the time he is able to spend on the Company's business. Mr. Casati, who is based in Singapore, receives a housing allowance and maintenance costs. Additional discussion of the personal benefits and other compensation provided to the named executive officers in fiscal 2018 is included in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Equity Ownership Requirements 
The Company has an equity ownership requirement policy pursuant to which the Company's most stringent share ownership requirements apply to the named executive officers. These share ownership requirements are intended to ensure that each of the named executive officers holds a meaningful ownership stake in Accenture. The Company intends that this ownership stake will further align the interests of the named executive officers and the Company's shareholders. Under these requirements, each of the named executive officers is required to hold Accenture equity (which may include unvested equity) with a value equal to at least 6 times his or her base compensation by the 5th anniversary of becoming a named executive officer. Each of our named executive officers maintains ownership of Accenture equity in excess of the requirement. Named executive officers may only satisfy this ownership requirement through the holdings they acquire pursuant to the Company's share programs, and the Company does not apply holding periods to any specific equity award beyond its vesting date(s). 
Derivatives and Hedging 
All employees, including our named executive officers, and members of the Board (or their designees) are prohibited from purchasing shares on margin or purchasing financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any fluctuations in the market value of the Company's equity securities they hold, whether or not such securities were acquired from Accenture's equity compensation programs. 
Pledging Company Securities 
Our chairman and chief executive officer and the members of our global management committee, other key employees and members of the Board are prohibited from borrowing against any account in which the Company's securities are held or pledging the Company's securities as collateral for a loan. 
Employment Agreements and Post-Termination Compensation 
Each of the Company's named executive officers has entered into an employment agreement with the Company's local affiliate in the country in which he or she is employed. As more specifically described in "Potential Payments Upon Termination" below, certain of the employment agreements provide for various post-termination payments, some of which are conditioned on compliance with non-competition and non-solicitation obligations following termination. In addition, members of Accenture Leadership employed in the United States, including Messrs. Rowland and van 't Noordende and Ms. Sweet, are eligible for benefits under our Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan, subject to, among other things, compliance with post-termination non-competition and non- solicitation obligations. The Company's employment agreements and the Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan do not include guaranteed bonus amounts, "golden parachutes," multi-year severance packages, significant accelerated vesting of stock awards or other payments triggered by a change in control, U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 280G or other tax gross-up payments related to a change in control, other than as may be required by local law. The named executive officers receive compensatory rewards that are tied to their own performance and the performance of the Company's business, rather than by virtue of longer-term employment agreements. This is consistent with the Company's objective to reward individual performance and support the achievement of its business objectives. 
Similarly, the Company does not contribute to pension plans for any of the current named executive officers and does not offer significant deferred cash compensation or other post-employment benefits to such officers. 
Finally, members of Accenture Leadership employed in the United States who retire from the Company after reaching age 50 and who have achieved at least 10 years of service are also eligible to participate in the U.S. Retiree Medical Benefit Program, which provides partially subsidized medical insurance benefits for them and their dependents. For more information, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination" below. 
No Change in Control Arrangements 
As described above, the Company's employment agreements do not contain guaranteed bonus amounts, "golden parachutes," multi-year severance packages or guarantees, accelerated vesting of stock awards or other payments triggered by a change in control. Similarly, we do not provide our executives U.S. Internal Revenue Code section 280G or other tax gross-up payments related to a change in control. 
Clawback Policy 
Accenture has a clawback policy that applies to both incentive cash bonus and equity-based incentive compensation awarded to the Company's chairman and chief executive officer, members of the global management committee and approximately 240 of its most senior leaders. Under the policy, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, the Company may seek to recoup any incentive-based compensation awarded to any executive subject to the policy, if (1) the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, (2) the misconduct of an executive subject to the policy contributed to the noncompliance that resulted in the obligation to restate and (3) a lower award would have been made to the covered executive had it been based upon the restated financial results. 
Under the terms of Mr. Nanterme's employment agreement, a violation of his obligations of confidentiality, non-competition and/or non-solicitation would result in a repayment by him of 6 months of base compensation. 
In addition, the existing equity grant agreements between Accenture and our named executive officers include recoupment provisions in specific circumstances, even after the awards have vested. In the event a named executive officer leaves the Company and competes against us within a specified time period (for example, by joining a competitor, targeting our clients or recruiting our employees) or in the event the named executive officer is terminated for cause (which generally includes engaging in any activity that the executive knows or should know would harm the business or reputation of Accenture or continued material failure to meet performance standards), the award recipient is generally obligated to return to the Company the shares originally delivered to that recipient under our equity programs. 
Compensation Risk Assessment and Management 
In fiscal 2018, management performed an annual comprehensive review for the Compensation Committee regarding whether the risks arising from any of our compensation policies or practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We believe that the structure of our compensation program does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. Our policies and practices include some of the following risk-mitigating characteristics:

(5)  The incremental costs of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Mr. Nanterme for fiscal 2018 were  $75,667 for a car and driver and $20,177 for tax preparation fees. The incremental cost of Mr. Nanterme's car and driver, which Mr. Nanterme uses for security purposes and to maximize the time he is able to spend on the Company's  business, was computed based on the actual fees paid to a service provider. The incremental costs of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Mr. Casati for fiscal 2018 were $192,082 for a housing allowance and maintenance costs,  $2,035 for tax preparation fees and $303 for a health insurance premium payment.

    Also included for fiscal 2018 are life insurance premium payments of $10,971 for Mr. Nanterme, $8,195 for  Mr. Rowland, $3,279 for Mr. Casati, $4,362 for Mr. van 't Noordende and $3,956 for Ms. Sweet, and payments of $876 to Mr. Rowland, $853 to Mr. van 't Noordende and $8,944 to Ms. Sweet as  reimbursement for excess taxes paid by them in jurisdictions in which those executives provided services to the Company outside of their respective home jurisdictions. These services resulted in taxes due in excess of the rate applicable to their  respective home jurisdictions, which excesses were reimbursed by the Company. The amounts further include $11,633 for Mr. Nanterme for profit sharing contributions mandated by French law.

    Also, in accordance with applicable SEC rules, the value of dividend equivalents credited or otherwise allocated to RSUs  in the form of additional RSUs with the same vesting terms as the original awards is not included in the "All Other Compensation" column because their value is factored into the grant date fair value of RSU awards. Additional RSUs awarded  in connection with dividend adjustments are subject to vesting and delivery conditions as part of the underlying awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    In accordance with the SEC's disclosure rules, perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Ms. Sweet and  Messrs. Rowland and van 't Noordende for fiscal 2018 are not included because the aggregate incremental value of these items was less than $10,000.

Key Executive Performance Share Program 
Our Key Executive Performance Share Program is described generally under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Programs—Long-Term Equity Compensation—Key Executive Performance Share Program" above. The description below relates to the RSU grants we made to our named executive officers in fiscal 2018 pursuant to the Key Executive Performance Share Program, which have a 3-year performance period beginning on September 1, 2017 and ending on August 31, 2020. The Compensation Committee determined that the compensation opportunity under these grants will be based on performance weighted 75% on cumulative program-specific operating income results and 25% on cumulative relative total shareholder return, in each case over that 3-year period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating income results. Up to 75% of the total RSUs granted to a named executive  officer on January 1, 2018 under this program will vest, if at all, at the end of the 3-year performance period based upon the achievement of operating income targets by the Company during the performance  period. For each fiscal year during the performance period, the Compensation Committee approves an operating income plan for this program that the Compensation Committee deems to be challenging. The aggregate of these 3 annual operating income plans  forms the reference, or target, for measuring aggregate operating income results over the 3 years. A performance rate is then calculated as the actual aggregate operating income divided by the target aggregate operating income, with the percentage  vesting of RSUs determined as follows:

Accenture shares underlying the RSUs granted under the Key Executive Performance Share Program that vest are delivered following the Compensation Committee's determination of the Company's results with respect to the performance metrics. Each of our named executive officers received a grant of RSUs under the Key Executive Performance Share Program on January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018, and each, except Ms. Sweet, was eligible for provisional age-based vesting as of the grant dates. Provisional age-based vesting means that if a participant voluntarily terminates his or her employment after reaching age 50 and completing 15 years of continuous service, the participant is entitled to pro rata vesting of his or her award at the end of the 3-year performance period based on the portion of the performance period during which he or she was employed. The vesting schedules for the Key Executive Performance Share Program awards that were outstanding at the end of fiscal year 2018 are set forth in footnote 4 to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at August 31, 2018" table below. 
The terms of these programs provide that the number of RSUs granted and still outstanding on any applicable record date will be adjusted proportionally to reflect the Company's payment of dividends or other significant corporate events. Additional RSUs awarded in connection with dividend adjustments are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying awards. 
Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program 
The Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program is described generally under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Programs—Long-Term Equity Compensation—Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program" above. As described in such section, awards under this program are generally granted in January in recognition of prior fiscal year performance. 
Grants under the Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program vest in 3 equal annual installments on each January 1 following the grant date until fully vested. However, grants under this program to participants who are age 50 or older on the date of grant have a shortened vesting schedule that is graduated based on the age of the participant on the grant date, with a one-month vesting period applicable to participants who are age 56 or older on the grant date. As a result, a shorter vesting schedule applied for all or a portion of the RSUs granted under this program to each of our named executive officers in fiscal 2018, as further shown in the "Stock Vested in Fiscal 2018" table below. The actual vesting schedules for these awards outstanding at fiscal year-end are set forth in footnote 1 to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at August 31, 2018" table below. 
The terms of this program provide that the number of RSUs granted and still outstanding on any applicable record date will be adjusted proportionally to reflect the Company's payment of dividends or other significant corporate events. Additional RSUs awarded in connection with dividend adjustments are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying awards. 
Voluntary Equity Investment Program 
Under the Voluntary Equity Investment Program, members of Accenture Leadership, including all of our named executive officers, where permitted, may elect to designate up to 30% of their total cash compensation to this share purchase program. These amounts are deducted from after-tax income and used to make monthly purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares from Accenture at fair market value on the 5th of each month for contributions made in the previous month. Participants are awarded a 50% matching RSU grant after the last purchase of the program year in the form of 1 RSU for every 2 shares that have been purchased during the previous program year and that have not been sold or transferred prior to the awarding of the matching grant. This matching grant will generally vest in full 2 years from the date of the grant. Under the program, if a participant leaves Accenture or withdraws from the program prior to the award of the matching grant, he or she will not receive a matching grant. Total contributions from all participating members of Accenture Leadership under this program may be limited at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In the last completed program year, which ran from January to December 2017, Ms. Sweet and Mr. van 't Noordende participated in the Voluntary Equity Investment Program and, based on her and his purchases through the program, received a grant of matching RSUs under the Voluntary Equity Investment Program in fiscal 2018 as indicated above. 
The terms of this program provide that the number of RSUs granted and still outstanding on any applicable record date will be adjusted proportionally to reflect the Company's payment of dividends or other significant corporate events. Additional RSUs awarded in connection with dividend adjustments are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying awards. 
Clawback Policy 
Our equity awards are subject to clawback under specified conditions, as described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Additional Information—Clawback Policy" above.

  (b)  Vesting of the 2015 Key Executive Performance Share Program awards, based on the Company's achievement of the  specified performance criteria with respect to the period beginning September 1, 2014 and ended August 31, 2017, was determined by the Compensation Committee on October 25, 2017, the stated vesting date. Pursuant to the 2015 Key  Executive Performance Share Program, 110.6% of the target award of RSUs vested on October 25, 2017, after the end of fiscal 2017, based on the Company's achievement of specified performance criteria over the  3-year performance period. Because as of August 31, 2017, pursuant to the provisional age-based vesting provisions of their awards, each of the named executive  officers, except Ms. Sweet, had fully satisfied the service criteria for vesting, 100% of the earned awards granted to them were treated as having vested in full as of that date. None of the awards under this program actually vested until the  stated vesting date of October 25, 2017. For more information on these provisional vesting terms, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination—Long-Term Equity Compensation" below.

U.S. Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan and U.S. Retiree 
Medical Benefits Program 
Members of Accenture Leadership employed in the United States, including Ms. Sweet and Messrs. Rowland and van 't Noordende, are eligible for benefits under our U.S. Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan and our U.S. Retiree Medical Benefits Program. Estimated benefits under these plans are summarized in the table below. 
With respect to our most senior leaders, the U.S. Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, and contingent upon the execution of a separation agreement (which requires, among other things, a complete release of claims and affirmation of existing post-departure obligations, including non-compete and non-solicitation requirements), if the employment of a member of Accenture Leadership is involuntarily terminated, other than for "cause" (as defined under the plan) or certain other exceptions listed in the plan relating to terminations following a leave of absence or in connection with a business transaction where the individual is offered a position with a successor, the terminated executive is entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if the termination is for reasons unrelated to performance: (1) an amount equal to 6 months of base compensation,  plus (2) 1 week of base compensation for each completed year of service (up to an additional 8 weeks of base compensation), plus (3) a $12,000 COBRA payment (which is related to health and dental benefits); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if the termination is for reasons related to performance: (1) an amount equal to 4 months of base compensation, plus  (2) an $8,000 COBRA payment.  
[END TABLE]
All such payments will be made in a lump sum unless we elect to provide the payments on a payroll-by-payroll basis. In addition, under this plan, members of Accenture Leadership who are involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, including those terminated for reasons related to performance, are entitled to 12 months of outplacement benefits, which is provided by an outside firm selected by Accenture, at a maximum cost to Accenture of $11,000 per person. 
Members of Accenture Leadership employed in the United States who retire from the Company after reaching age 50 and who have achieved at least 10 years of service are also eligible to participate in the U.S. Retiree Medical Benefits Program, which provides partially subsidized medical insurance benefits for the retired members of Accenture Leadership and their dependents. 
The following table sets forth estimated benefits under the U.S. Accenture Leadership Separation Benefits Plan and U.S. Retiree Medical Benefits Program for the named executive officers who are or were employed in the United States during fiscal 2018.

The terms of our equity grant agreements for programs other than the Key Executive Performance Share Program provide for the immediate acceleration of vesting in the event of the termination of the program participant's employment due to death or disability. The equity grant agreements for our Key Executive Performance Share Program provide for provisional vesting of the awards in the event of the termination of the participant's employment due to death or disability. Provisional vesting means that, while the timing of vesting of the Key Executive Performance Share Program awards is not accelerated due to death or disability, vesting continues to occur as if the participant's employment had not terminated under those circumstances. 
With respect to each of our named executive officers, the number of RSUs that would have vested under these circumstances and the aggregate market value of such RSUs as of the last business day of fiscal 2018 (based on the closing price per share on August 31, 2018) is equal to the amount and value of shares set forth in the "Stock Awards" columns of the "Outstanding Equity Awards at August 31, 2018" table above. Although vesting cannot yet be determined for the 2017 and 2018 Key Executive Performance Share Program awards, as results to date indicate achievement between the target and maximum levels for both programs, maximum amounts are included in that table with respect to both programs. 
Other Terminations 
The terms of our equity grant agreements for the Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program also provide that, in the event of an involuntary termination of the program participant's employment, RSUs scheduled to vest within 12 months of termination immediately vest. However, shares underlying such RSUs will not be delivered until after the scheduled vesting date unless the program participant dies before such date. 
The terms of our equity grant agreements for the Voluntary Equity Investment Program provide that (1) in the event of an involuntary termination of the program participant's employment prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, 50% of the RSUs will immediately vest and (2) in the event of an involuntary termination that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, all of the RSUs will immediately vest. In both cases, however, the shares underlying the RSUs will not be delivered until after the scheduled vesting date, unless the program participant dies before such date. 
The terms of our equity grant agreements for the Key Executive Performance Share Program also provide for provisional vesting of the awards in the event of (1) voluntary termination of the program participant's employment after reaching age 50 and completing 15 years of continuous service or (2) involuntary termination. In such cases, the participant is entitled to pro rata vesting of his or her award at the end of the 3-year performance period based on the portion of the performance period during which he or she was employed. 
Qualifying members of our global management committee who retire on or after the fiscal year-end but before the following February 1 receive a cash payment in recognition of their prior fiscal year performance rather than receiving the shares underlying RSUs under the Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award Program that they would have received had they not retired before that date. 
The following table sets forth the amounts each named executive officer would have been entitled to receive under these provisions if his or her employment had been terminated as of August 31, 2018:

(3)  Mr. Nanterme does not qualify for this retirement benefit, and therefore no amount is shown in respect of his  retirement. For Messrs. Rowland, Casati and van 't Noordende, amounts shown in this column reflect the applicable portions of the grant date fair value of RSU awards to be made to them in January 2019 under the Accenture Leadership Performance  Equity Award Program, which were approved by the Compensation Committee following the end of fiscal 2018. For Ms. Sweet, no portion of the RSU award to be made to her in January 2019 under the Accenture Leadership Performance Equity Award  Program would qualify for this treatment.

PAY RATIO 
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee. 
Our Employees 
As of August 31, 2018, we employed approximately 459,000 people in 52 countries. Because of the geographical distribution of our workforce, our compensation program reflects many factors to determine how we compensate our employees in different countries around the world. 
Our Fiscal 2018 Pay Ratio 
Applying a cost-of-living adjustment, our median employee was located in India, with annual total compensation of $40,206. Comparing this to the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer of $22,299,174, our pay ratio was 555:1. Without the cost-of-living adjustment, the median employee would also have been located in India, with annual total compensation of $18,246, resulting in a ratio of 1,222:1. 
Pay Ratio Methodology 
Our pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the following methodology: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Identifying the Global Employee Population. We used our global employee population as  of August 31, 2018 and excluded the following employees, who represent less than 1% of our employees: (i) 4,397 from businesses mainly in the digital space that we acquired during fiscal 2018, and (ii) 67 in Andorra, 78 in Puerto Rico and 16 in  Taiwan. As a result of these exclusions, we considered a population of 454,614 employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Identifying the Median Employee. We used annual base salary as of August 31, 2018  and applied the World Bank's Purchasing Power Parity conversion factors to adjust the employees' base salary and the median employee's annual total compensation to the  cost-of-living in France, where our chairman and chief executive officer resides. For employees with the same median base salary, we calculated their annual total  compensation and identified the median of this group. Without the cost-of-living adjustment, we selected the median employee with a compensation profile that was more  representative of our employee population. Foreign currencies were converted into U.S. dollars using the average of the monthly translation rates for fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additional Information. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated  employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their  compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions,  estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

AUDIT 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent directors, each of whom meets the independence and experience requirements set forth by the SEC and the NYSE. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an independent director and possesses the requisite competence in accounting or auditing in satisfaction of the requirements for audit committees prescribed by the Companies Act 2014. 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which may be accessed through the Governance Principles section of our website at https://accenture.com/us-en/company-principles. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements, subject to any requirements under Irish law. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal accounting controls. KPMG, Accenture's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As part of the Audit Committee's oversight function, the Audit Committee: 
In addition, in reliance upon its reviews and discussions as outlined above, the Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the Company's audited financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC and approved the Company's Irish financial statements for presentation to the Company's shareholders. The Audit Committee also recommended during fiscal 2019 that KPMG be re-appointed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to serve until the Company's annual general meeting of shareholders in 2020 and that the Board submit this appointment to the Company's shareholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. This report is provided by the following independent directors, who compose the Audit Committee:

PROPOSAL 3: NON-BINDING RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND BINDING AUTHORIZATION OF THE BOARD TO DETERMINE ITS REMUNERATION 
Shareholders are being asked to vote to ratify, in a non-binding vote, the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, and also to vote to authorize, in a binding vote, the Board, acting through the Audit Committee, to determine KPMG's remuneration. Upon the Audit Committee's recommendation, the Board has recommended the re-appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019. Although ratification is not required by our Memorandum and Articles of Association or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification because we value our shareholders' views on the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. KPMG has served as our auditor since 2002, and we believe that the continued retention of KPMG is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If our shareholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be regarded as notice to the Board and the Audit Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
In evaluating and selecting the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers, among other things: the historical and recent performance of our current independent auditor; external data on audit quality and performance, including PCAOB reports; the capabilities, audit approach, industry experience, independence and tenure of the audit firm. To help ensure the independence of our auditor, the Audit Committee periodically considers the rotation of our independent auditor and the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairman are directly involved in the selection of KPMG's lead engagement partner. 
We expect that one or more representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting. Each of these representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires, and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of Proposal 3 is an ordinary resolution that requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast. 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF 
PROPOSAL 3 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
"To ratify, in a non-binding vote, the appointment of KPMG as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company until the next annual general meeting of the Company in 2020 and to authorize, in a binding vote, the Board, acting through the Audit Committee, to determine its remuneration." 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the non-binding ratification of the appointment of KPMG as independent registered public accounting firm and the binding authorization of the Board, acting through the Audit Committee, to determine KPMGs remuneration.

[END TABLE]
PROCEDURES FOR AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving, in advance, any audit and any permissible non-audit engagement or relationship between Accenture and its independent auditors. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chair the authority to review and pre-approve any such engagement or relationship, which may be proposed in between its regular meetings. Any such pre-approval is subsequently considered and ratified by the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting. In connection with the approval of any non-audit services, the Audit Committee concluded that the provision of these services and related fees do not affect the independence of KPMG. 
ANNUAL IRISH LAW PROPOSALS 
PROPOSAL 4: BOARD AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SHARES 
Under Irish law, directors of an Irish public limited company must have authority from its shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company's authorized but unissued share capital. Our current authorization, approved by shareholders at our 2018 annual general meeting, will expire on August 7, 2019. We are presenting this Proposal 4 to renew the Board's authority to issue our authorized shares on the terms set forth below. 
We understand that it is customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to issue up to 33% of a company's issued ordinary share capital and for such authority to be limited to a period of 12 to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking approval to authorize the Board to issue up to a maximum of 33% of our issued ordinary share capital as of December 3, 2018 (the latest practicable date before this proxy statement), for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, revoked or renewed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to propose renewal of this authorization on a regular basis at our annual general meetings in subsequent years. 
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish market practice. This authority is fundamental to our business and enables us to issue shares, including, if applicable, in connection with funding acquisitions and raising capital. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital or to approve a specific issuance of shares. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board the authority to issue shares that are already authorized under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. In addition, we note that, because we are a NYSE-listed company, our shareholders continue to benefit from the protections afforded to them under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and SEC, including those rules that limit our ability to issue shares in specified circumstances. Furthermore, we note that this authorization is required as a matter of Irish law and is not otherwise required for other companies listed on the NYSE with whom we compete. Accordingly, approval of this resolution would merely place us on par with other NYSE-listed companies. 
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of Proposal 4 is an ordinary resolution that requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast. 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF 
PROPOSAL 4 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
"That the directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorized with effect from the passing of this resolution to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within the meaning of section 1021 of the Companies Act 2014) up to an aggregate nominal amount of $23,653.51 (219,856,520 shares) (being equivalent to approximately 33% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of December 3, 2018 (the latest practicable date before this proxy statement)), and the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked; provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this authority, which would or might require any such securities to be allotted after this authority has expired, and in that case, the directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired." 
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" granting the Board authority to issue shares under Proposal 4. 
PROPOSAL 5: BOARD AUTHORITY TO OPT-OUT OF PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS 
Under Irish law, unless otherwise authorized, when an Irish public limited company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders of the company on a pro-rata basis (commonly referred to as the pre-emption right). Because our current authority will expire on August 7, 2019, we are presenting this Proposal 5 to renew the Board's authority to opt-out of the pre-emption right on the terms set forth below. 
We understand that it is customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to opt-out of the pre-emption rights provision in the event of (1) the issuance of shares for cash in connection with any rights issue and (2) the issuance of shares for cash, if the issuance is limited to up to 5% of a company's issued ordinary share capital. It is also customary practice for such authority to be limited to a period of 12 to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking this authority for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, renewed or revoked. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to propose renewal of this authorization on a regular basis at our annual general meetings in subsequent years. 
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish customary practice. Similar to the authorization sought for Proposal 4, this authority is fundamental to our business and, if applicable, will facilitate our ability to fund acquisitions and otherwise raise capital. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board the authority to issue shares in the manner already permitted under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. Without this authorization, in each case where we issue shares for cash, we would first have to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to all of our existing shareholders. This requirement could cause delays in the completion of acquisitions and capital raising for our business. Furthermore, we note that this authorization is required as a matter of Irish law and is not otherwise required for other companies listed on the NYSE with whom we compete. Accordingly, approval of this resolution would merely place us on par with other NYSE-listed companies. 
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of Proposal 5 is a special resolution that requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast. In addition, under Irish law, the Board may only be authorized to opt-out of pre-emption rights if it is authorized to issue shares, which authority is being sought in Proposal 4. 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF 
PROPOSAL 5 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
"As a special resolution, that, subject to the passing of the resolution in respect of Proposal 4 as set out above and with effect from the passing of this resolution, the directors be and are hereby empowered pursuant to section 1023 of the Companies Act 2014 to allot equity securities (as defined in section 1023 of that Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by Proposal 4 as if sub-section (1) of section 1022 did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this power shall be limited to: 
(a) the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue in favor of the holders of ordinary shares (including rights to subscribe for, or convert into, ordinary shares) where the equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of such holders are proportional (as nearly as may be) to the respective numbers of ordinary shares held by them (but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional entitlements that would otherwise arise, or with legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of any recognized regulatory body or any stock exchange in, any territory, or otherwise); and 
(b) the allotment (other than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of $3,583.87 (33,311,594 shares) (being equivalent to approximately 5% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of December 3, 2018 (the latest practicable date before this proxy statement)), and the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked; provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this authority, which would or might require any such securities to be allotted after this authority has expired, and in that case, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired." 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR granting the Board authority to opt-out of pre-emption rights under Proposal 5. 
PROPOSAL 6: DETERMINE PRICE RANGE FOR RE-ALLOTMENT OF TREASURY SHARES 
Our historical open-market share repurchases and other share buyback activities result in some of our ordinary shares being returned as treasury shares. Our executive compensation program, the 2010 Employee Share Purchase Program, and our other compensation programs make use of treasury shares that we acquire through our various share buyback activities. 
Under Irish law, our shareholders must authorize the price range at which Accenture plc may re-allot any shares held in treasury as new shares of Accenture plc. In this proposal, that price range is expressed as a percentage of the minimum and maximum of the closing market price on the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is re-allotted. Irish law requires that this authorization be renewed by our shareholders every 18 months, and we therefore expect that it will continue to be proposed at subsequent annual general meetings. 
The authority being sought from our shareholders provides that the minimum and maximum prices at which a treasury Class A ordinary share may be re-allotted are 95% (or nominal value where the re-allotment of treasury shares is required to satisfy an obligation under any compensation program (including any share scheme or option scheme)) and 120%, respectively, of the closing market price of the Class A ordinary shares on the NYSE the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is re-allotted, except as described below. Any re-allotment of treasury shares will only be at price levels that the Company considers to be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of Proposal 6 is a special resolution that requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast. 
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF 
PROPOSAL 6 IS AS FOLLOWS: 
"As a special resolution, that the re-allotment price range at which any treasury Class A ordinary shares for the time being held by Accenture plc may be re-allotted shall be as follows: 
(a) The maximum price at which a treasury Class A ordinary share may be re-allotted shall not be more than 120% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for shares of that class on the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is re-allotted by Accenture plc. 
(b) The minimum price at which a treasury Class A ordinary share may be re-allotted shall be the nominal value of the share where such a share is required to satisfy an obligation under any compensation program (including any share scheme or option scheme) operated by Accenture plc or, in all other cases, not less than 95% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for shares of that class on the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is re-allotted by Accenture plc. 
(c) The re-allotment price range as determined by paragraphs (a) and (b) shall expire 18 months from the date of the passing of this resolution, unless previously varied, revoked or renewed in accordance with the provisions of Section 109 and/or 1078 of the Companies Act 2014." 
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the determination of the price range at which Accenture plc can re-allot shares that it acquires as treasury shares. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT 
THE ANNUAL MEETING 
WHY DID I RECEIVE THESE PROXY MATERIALS? 
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting. We either (1) mailed you a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability") notifying each shareholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting how to vote and how to electronically access a copy of this proxy statement and our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 (referred to as the "Proxy Materials") or (2) mailed you a paper copy of the Proxy Materials and a proxy card in paper format. You received these Proxy Materials because you were a shareholder of record as of the close of business on December 3, 2018. If you have not received, but would like to receive, a paper copy of the Proxy Materials and a proxy card in paper format, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials contained in the Notice of Internet Availability. 
WHAT IS THE DATE, TIME AND LOCATION OF THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
We will hold the Annual Meeting at 12:00 pm local time on Friday, February 1, 2019, at The Dock, located at 7 Hanover Quay, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2, Ireland, subject to any adjournments or postponements. For directions to the meeting, you may contact our Corporate Secretary, c/o Accenture, 161 N. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60601, USA. 
WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE? 
The Board has set December 3, 2018 as the record date for the Annual Meeting. All persons who were registered holders of Accenture plc's Class A ordinary shares and/or Class X ordinary shares at the close of business on that date are shareholders of record for the purposes of the Annual Meeting and will be entitled to receive notice of, and to attend and vote at, the Annual Meeting. Beneficial owners who, at the close of business on the record date, held their shares in an account with a broker, bank or other holder of record generally cannot vote their shares directly and instead must instruct the record holder how to vote their shares. 
As of the close of business on the record date, there were 665,541,059 Class A ordinary shares outstanding (which includes 28,092,464 shares held by Accenture) and 650,821 Class X ordinary shares outstanding. Class A ordinary shares held by Accenture may not be voted and, accordingly, will have no impact on the outcome of any vote of the shareholders of Accenture plc. Each shareholder of record is entitled to one vote per Class A ordinary share and one vote per Class X ordinary share on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class X ordinary shares will vote together, and not as separate classes, on all matters being considered at the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be represented if you attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or if you submit a completed proxy by the voting deadlines set forth below. 
HOW DO I VOTE? 
Registered shareholders (that is, shareholders who hold their shares directly with our transfer agent, Computershare) can vote in any of the following ways: 
If you sign and return your proxy, but do not give voting instructions, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board as described in this proxy statement. If any other matters are properly brought up at the Annual Meeting (other than the proposals contained in this proxy statement), then the named proxies will have the authority to vote your shares on those matters in accordance with their discretion and judgment. The Board currently does not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals contained in this proxy statement. 
If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, your electronic vote authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you signed, dated and returned a proxy card by mail. 
IF I AM A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES HELD IN STREET NAME, 
HOW DO I VOTE? 
If your shares are held beneficially in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record (sometimes referred to as holding shares "in street name"), you will receive instructions from the holder of record that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted. If you wish to vote in person at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the bank, broker or other holder of record that holds your shares, and bring it, or other evidence of stock ownership, with you to the meeting. 
IF I AM A CURRENT OR FORMER ACCENTURE EMPLOYEE WITH 
EMPLOYEE PLAN SHARES, HOW DO I VOTE? 
If you are a current or former Accenture employee with shares received through our employee plans and held by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC ("MSSB") or UBS Financial Services, Inc. ("UBS"), you may receive one proxy card that covers the shares held for you by MSSB and/or UBS, as well as any other shares registered directly in your name. You may submit one proxy for all of these shares via the Internet, by telephone or by mail in the same manner as described above for registered shareholders. If you vote your plan shares by 11:59 pm EST on January 29, 2019, MSSB and/or UBS will vote the shares as you have directed. 
It is important that you direct MSSB and/or UBS how to vote your shares. If voting instructions are not received on time by MSSB, MSSB will not vote your shares for any proposal. If voting instructions are not received on time by UBS, UBS will not vote your shares on non-routine proposals (Proposals 1 and 2). UBS will, however, vote your shares on routine proposals (Proposals 3, 4, 5 and 6) in the same proportion as the plan shares with respect to which voting instructions for routine proposals were received by UBS on a timely basis. 
Participants with shares received through employee plans may attend the Annual Meeting by following the instructions in the section "What do I need to be admitted to the Annual Meeting?" below. Shares held through MSSB and/or UBS, however, can only be voted as described in this section and cannot be voted at the meeting.

The deadlines to submit your votes for the Annual Meeting are set forth below.

CAN I REVOKE MY PROXY OR CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE VOTED? 
Yes. If you are a registered shareholder and previously voted by Internet, telephone, scanning a QR Code or mail, you may revoke your proxy or change your vote by: 
If you are a current or former employee and your employee plan shares are held by MSSB or UBS, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote by voting at a later date by Internet, telephone or mail if you do so no later than 11:59 pm EST on January 29, 2019. You cannot revoke and change your proxy with respect to your employee plan shares after that date, and you cannot revoke and vote your plan shares in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you must contact the holder of record to revoke a previously authorized proxy. 
WHAT DO I NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
At the entrance to the Annual Meeting in Dublin, we will request to see your admission ticket and valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. We encourage you to request an admission ticket for the Annual Meeting in advance. You may request admission tickets by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions provided. You will need the 16-digit control number included on your proxy card, voter instruction form or Notice of Internet Availability. If you do not request an admission ticket in advance, we will need to determine if you owned ordinary shares on the record date by: 
If you are acting as a proxy, we will need to review a valid written legal proxy signed by the registered owner of the ordinary shares granting you the required authority to attend the meeting and vote such shares. 
WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM? 
In order to establish a quorum at the Annual Meeting there must be at least 3 shareholders present in person or by proxy who have the right to attend and vote at the meeting and who together hold shares representing more than 50% of the votes that may be cast by all shareholders of record. For purposes of determining a quorum, abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present. 
HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED? 
You may vote "FOR", "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each of the proposals presented. A vote "FOR" will be counted in favor of the proposal or respective director nominee and a vote "AGAINST" will be counted against each proposal or respective nominee. Except as described below, an "ABSTAIN" vote will not be counted "FOR" or "AGAINST" and will have no effect on the voting results for any of the proposals in this proxy statement. Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. will act as our Inspector of Election at the Annual Meeting and assist us in tabulating the votes. 
WHAT IS A "BROKER NON-VOTE" AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT VOTING? 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, we encourage you to instruct the broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote", which occurs for proposals considered "non-routine" under NYSE rules. Your broker will, however, still be able to register your shares as being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and will be able to vote on "routine" proposals. 
The "routine" proposals in this proxy statement are Proposals 3, 4, 5 and 6, for which your broker has discretionary voting authority under the NYSE rules to vote your shares, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. Proposals 1 and 2 are considered "non-routine" such that, if you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker and you do not provide voting instructions, a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these proposals. 
WHAT IS THE VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS DISCUSSED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT? 
The chart below summarizes the voting requirements and effects of broker non-votes and abstentions on the outcome of the vote for the proposals at the Annual Meeting.

 by the director nominee will become vacant. The Board has the ability to fill the vacancy upon the recommendation of its Nominating & Governance Committee, in accordance with Accenture plc's Articles of Association, subject to re-appointment by Accenture plc's shareholders at the next annual general meeting of shareholders. 
WHO WILL PAY FOR THE COST OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATION? 
Accenture will bear the costs of soliciting proxies from the holders of our Class A ordinary shares and Class X ordinary shares. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by our directors, officers and other selected Accenture employees telephonically, electronically or by other means of communication, and by Georgeson LLC, whom we have hired to assist in the solicitation of proxies. Directors, officers and employees who help us in the solicitation will not be specially compensated for those services, but they may be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation. Georgeson LLC will receive a fee of $25,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, for its services. Brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested to forward soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in sending the materials to beneficial owners. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Materials for the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be Held on February 1, 2019: The proxy statement, our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and our Irish financial statements are available free of charge at www.proxyvote.com. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS 
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements with respect to 2 or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report and proxy statement or a single notice of internet availability of proxy materials addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding", reduces the volume of duplicate information received at households and helps to reduce costs. While the Company does not household, a number of brokerage firms with account holders who are Accenture shareholders have instituted householding. Once a shareholder has consented or receives notice from his or her broker that the broker will be householding materials to the shareholder's address, householding will continue until the shareholder is notified otherwise or until one or more of the shareholders revokes his or her consent. If your notice of internet availability of proxy materials or your annual report and proxy statement, as applicable, have been househeld and you wish to receive separate copies of these documents now and/or in the future, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, you may notify your broker. You can also request and the Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or the Proxy Materials by writing or calling our Investor Relations Group at the following address, telephone number or e-mail address: Accenture, Investor Relations, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 6th Floor, New York, New York 10105, USA; telephone number, +1 (703) 948-5150 in the United States and Puerto Rico, and +(353) (1) 407-8203 outside the United States and Puerto Rico; or e-mail, investor.relations@accenture.com. 
SUBMISSION OF FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Our annual general meeting of shareholders for 2020 is expected to be held in February 2020. In accordance with the rules established by the SEC, any shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 to be included in the proxy statement for that meeting must be received by us by August 14, 2019. If you would like to submit a shareholder proposal to be included in those proxy materials, you should send your proposal to our Corporate Secretary, c/o Accenture, 161 N. Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60601, USA. In order for your proposal to be included in the proxy statement, the proposal must comply with the requirements established by the SEC and our Articles of Association. 
Pursuant to our Articles of Association, a shareholder must give notice of any intention to propose a person for appointment as a director not less than 120 nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for our prior year's annual general meeting ("traditional advance notice"). In addition, shareholders have the right, subject to certain terms and conditions, to have their nominee included in our proxy materials for the applicable Annual Meeting ("proxy access"). Subject to our Articles of Association, any notice of an intention to nominate a person for appointment as a director pursuant to traditional advance notice or proxy access must be received by our Corporate Secretary on or after July 10, 2019 but no later than August 9, 2019. Unless a shareholder who wishes to present a proposal at the Annual Meeting (other than a proposal to appoint a person as a director outlined above) outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act has submitted such proposal to us by the close of business on October 28, 2019, subject to applicable rules, we will have discretionary authority to vote on any such proposal with respect to all proxies submitted to us even when we do not include in our proxy statement advice on the nature of the matter and how we intend to exercise our discretion to vote on the matter. 
Irish law currently provides that shareholders holding 10% or more of the total voting rights may request that the directors call an extraordinary general meeting at any time. The shareholders who wish to request an extraordinary general meeting must deliver to Accenture's principal executive office a written notice, signed by the shareholders requesting the meeting and stating the purposes of the meeting. If the directors do not, within 21 days of the date of delivery of the request, proceed to convene a meeting to be held within 2 months of that date, those shareholders (or any of them representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them) may themselves convene a meeting, but any meeting so convened cannot be held after the expiration of 3 months from the date of delivery of the request. These provisions of Irish law are in addition to, and separate from, the requirements that a shareholder must meet in order to have a proposal included in the proxy statement under the rules of the SEC.
