[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  To conduct such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
The Proxy Statement accompanying this Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders describes each of these items in detail. In addition, the Proxy Statement contains other important information that you should read and consider before you vote. 
The Board of Directors of the Company has fixed the close of business on February 26, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders who are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
The Company is furnishing proxy materials over the Internet as permitted under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules, many of the Company's stockholders will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement, our Proxy Card, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Letter from our Chairman & CEO. We believe this process allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need while lowering the costs of printing and distributing proxy materials. Stockholders who do not receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. 
Your vote is very important to us and we encourage you to vote your shares as soon as possible even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person. Information about how to vote your shares via the Internet, by telephone, or by signing, dating and returning your Proxy Card can be found in the enclosed Proxy Statement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]

There are no cumulative voting rights.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote my shares by proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Most stockholders can vote their shares by proxy in three ways:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet – You can vote via the Internet by going to  www.envisionreports.com/hsc and following the instructions outlined on that website;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone – In the United States and Canada, you can vote telephonically  by calling (800) 652-8683 (toll free) and following the instructions provided by the recorded message; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

If you wish to vote by mail but received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in lieu of a paper copy of the proxy  materials, you may contact our Corporate Communications Department by calling (717) 763-7064 to request that a full packet of proxy materials be sent to your home address.

[END TABLE]
Please see the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the information your bank, broker or other holder of record provided you for more information on these voting options. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I vote in person at the Annual Meeting instead of voting by proxy?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes, please bring the 2019 Annual Meeting Admission Ticket and photo identification to the registration desk when  you arrive at the Annual Meeting. While we encourage all stockholders to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares via the Internet, by telephone or by mail prior to the Annual Meeting, even if you plan to attend.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change or revoke my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. You may change or revoke your proxy by Internet, telephone or mail prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on  Monday, April 22, 2019. You may also change or revoke your proxy by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, only that bank, broker or nominee can revoke your proxy on  your behalf.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give instructions to my broker?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting  instructions to your broker by the deadline provided in the proxy materials you received from your broker. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, whether your shares can be voted by your broker depends on the proposal being  considered. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), if your broker does not receive voting instructions from you, the broker is entitled to vote your shares on all "routine" proposals being considered, including  the ratification of our auditors (Proposal No. 2). Brokers are not entitled to vote your shares with respect to the election of Directors or the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (Proposal Nos. 1  and 3) without your instructions. This is referred to as a broker "non-vote."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if I hold my shares through the Harsco Corporation Savings Plan or the Harsco Retirement  Savings & Investment Plan?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a participant in the Harsco Corporation Savings Plan and/or the Harsco Retirement Savings &  Investment Plan, you can instruct the Trustee of those plans how to vote the shares of Common Stock that are allocated to your account, if any, by going to www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions outlined  in that website or by calling (800) 690-6903 (toll free) and following the instructions provided by the recorded message. You may also fill out the enclosed voting instruction card and return it pursuant to  the instructions set forth on the card.  
[END TABLE]
If you do not instruct the Trustee how to vote your shares, the Trustee will vote them in the same proportion as those shares for which the Trustee did receive voting instructions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many shares must be present to conduct the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  To carry on the business of the Annual Meeting, a minimum number of shares, constituting a quorum, must be present  at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. A quorum consists of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock as of the Record Date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required to pass each of the proposals at the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Assuming that a quorum is present:  
[END TABLE]
Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors – nominees for the Board of Directors will be elected if more votes are cast in favor of a nominee then are cast against such nominee by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal No. 2: Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Independent Auditors – the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required. 
Proposal No. 3: Vote, on an Advisory Basis, to Approve the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers – the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote is required.  In certain circumstances, a stockholder will be considered to be present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes but will not be deemed to have cast a vote on each particular proposal. This occurs when a stockholder withholds a vote or abstains from voting on a proposal, or in the event of a broker non-vote. In accordance with Delaware law and our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, broker non-votes will not be treated as votes cast with respect to the election of Directors (Proposal No. 1) and therefore will not affect the outcome of Director elections. With respect to the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal No. 3), abstentions will have the effect of negative votes, but broker non-votes will not have any effect. With respect to the ratification of our auditors (Proposal No. 2), abstentions will have the effect of negative votes. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if a nominee for Director does not receive majority approval?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, in an uncontested election (that is, an election where the number of Director  nominees does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected), each Director nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in order to be elected. In addition, our by-laws provide that if a nominee does not receive more "for" votes than votes "withheld" for his or her election, the Director must tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then review the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it.

 The Board of Directors 
General Oversight 
The Board has general oversight responsibility for the Company's affairs. Although the Board does not have responsibility for day-to-day management of the Company, Board members stay informed about the Company's business through regular meetings, site visits and other periodic interactions with management. The Board is deeply involved in the strategic planning process for the Company and each of its business divisions. The Board also plays an important oversight role in the Company's leadership development and succession planning processes. 
Composition 
The Board is currently comprised of eight Directors, seven of whom qualify as independent. In accordance with the Board's Corporate Governance Principles and applicable sections of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the "NYSE Rules"), the independent Directors regularly meet in executive session. These meetings allow the independent Directors to discuss important issues, including the business and affairs of the Company as well as matters concerning management, without any member of management present. During the 2018 fiscal year, the independent Directors held five meetings. On average, the group of independent Directors attended 98% of the independent Directors' meetings held in 2018. 
Leadership Structure 
The Company's governance documents provide the Board with flexibility to select the leadership structure that is most appropriate for the Company and its stockholders. The Board regularly evaluates the Company's leadership structure and has concluded that the Company and its stockholders are best served by not having a formal policy regarding whether the same individual should serve as both Chairman of the Board and CEO. This approach allows the Board to elect the most qualified Director as Chairman of the Board while also maintaining the ability to separate the Chairman of the Board and CEO roles when necessary or appropriate. 
In 2018 the Board elected F. Nicholas Grasberger III, our President & CEO, as Chairman of the Board. In addition, the Board elected David C. Everitt as independent Lead Director of the Board. When the Board appointed Mr. Everitt as the Lead Director, the Board reviewed the Lead Director's role and responsibilities to ensure responsible oversight, including taking into account feedback received from existing investors (see "Engagement Regarding Leadership Structure" below). 
As Lead Director, Mr. Everitt has the following responsibilities, which are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establishing the agenda for the executive sessions of the independent directors;  
• Calling meetings of the independent directors, in addition to the executive sessions of independent directors held after  each Board meeting;  
• Chairing the executive sessions and other meetings of the independent directors;  
• Communicating the result of meetings of the independent directors to the Chairman and other members of management, as  appropriate;  
• Regularly consulting with the Chairman;  
• Discussing the schedule and agenda for the Board meetings with the Chairman;  
• Approving the meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
• Presiding at Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman;  
• Reviewing information that is sent to the Board and all critical communications to the Board; and  
• Being available for consultation and direct communication at the request of major stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
 Finally, the Board has established three standing committees to assist with its oversight responsibilities: (1) the Audit Committee; (2) the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "MD&C Committee"); and (3) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee"). Each of the Audit Committee, MD&C Committee and Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of independent Directors. 
Engagement Regarding Leadership Structure 
In order to continuously evaluate the Company's governance and compensation policies and processes, we continually engage our stockholders on various issues through an extensive and thoughtful investor relations program. In addition to the Company's outreach via investor conferences, roadshows, and other means, an engagement team specifically reached out to holders of over 60% of our outstanding shares regarding governance matters and the potential recombination of our Chairman and CEO roles before the Board elected Mr. Grasberger as Chairman. During those engagements, Harsco received valuable feedback on considerations for, and responsibilities of, a Lead Director. In addition, during those engagements Harsco also gained valuable insight on several topics, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Governance trends;  
• Environmental risk management;  
• Board composition and Director skills/expertise; and  
• Executive compensation and alignment with performance.  
[END TABLE]
This feedback was shared with the Board and its relevant committees. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Management is responsible for identifying, evaluating, managing and mitigating the Company's exposure to risk. It is the Board's responsibility to oversee the Company's risk management process and to ensure that management is taking appropriate action to identify, manage and mitigate key risks. The Board administers its risk oversight responsibilities both through active review and discussion of key risks facing the Company and by delegating certain risk oversight responsibilities to committees for further consideration and evaluation. The following table summarizes the role of the Board and each of its committees in overseeing risk: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The decision to administer the Board's oversight responsibilities in this manner has a key effect on the Board's leadership and committee structure, described in more detail above. 
Experience, Skills and Qualifications 
The Nominating Committee works with the full Board to determine the appropriate characteristics, skills and experiences for the Board as a whole as well as its individual members. While the Nominating Committee has not established minimum criteria for Director candidates, it has established important factors that it considers when evaluating potential candidates. These factors are set forth in the Board's Corporate Governance Principles and include integrity and strength of character, mature judgment, strategic thinking, demonstrated leadership skills, relevant business experience, experience with international business issues and risk, public company experience, innovation, technology or information technology expertise, brand marketing experience, availability, career specialization, relevant technical skills, time and willingness to perform duties as a Director, absence of conflicts of interest, diversity and the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board. In addition, as explained in more detail below in the section entitled "Diversity," the Board is committed to a policy of inclusiveness that requires all new Board nominees to be drawn from a pool that includes diverse candidates, with a commitment to seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates. 
In addition to evaluating new Director candidates, the Nominating Committee regularly assesses the composition of the Board in order to ensure it reflects an appropriate balance of knowledge, skills, expertise, diversity and independence. As part of this assessment, each Director is asked to identify and assess the particular experiences, skills and other attributes that qualify him or her to serve as a member of the Board. Based on the most recent assessment of the Board's composition completed in February 2019, the Nominating Committee and the Board have determined that, in light of the Company's current business structure and strategies, the Board has an appropriate mix of Director experiences, skills, qualifications and backgrounds. 
Set forth below is a general description of the types of experiences and skills the Nominating Committee and the Board believe to be particularly relevant to the Company at this time: 
Leadership Experience 
Directors who have demonstrated significant leadership experience over an extended period of time, especially current and former executive officers, provide the Company with valuable insights that can only be gained through years of   managing complex organizations. These individuals understand both the day-to-day operational responsibilities facing senior management and the role Directors play in overseeing the affairs of large organizations. Seven of the eight nominees are current or former executive officers. 
International Experience 
Given the Company's global footprint and current focus on growing its presence in emerging markets, Directors with experience in markets outside the United States are critical to the Company's long-term success. 
Innovation and Technology Experience 
In light of the important role of innovation and technology to the Company's businesses, Directors with innovation and technology experience add significant value to the Board. 
General Industrial Experience 
Directors that have direct experience with industrial businesses bring key insights to the strategic planning process and provide important practical experience to the Board and management. 
Brand Marketing Experience 
Directors with a proven track record for marketing and growing global brands bring valuable skills that can have a positive impact on the Company's operational results, especially as it looks to leverage its brand to expand into new markets and territories. 
Financial Experience 
Directors with an understanding of accounting, finance and financial reporting processes, particularly as they relate to large, multi-national businesses, are critical to the Company. Accurate financial reporting is a cornerstone of the Company's success, and Directors with financial expertise help to provide effective oversight of the Company's financial measures and processes. 
A description of the most relevant experiences, skills, attributes and qualifications that qualify each Director candidate to serve as a member of the Board is included in his or her biography. 
Diversity 
The Board believes that diversity is one of many important considerations in board composition. To ensure the Board is comprised of members with an appropriate mix of characteristics, skills, experiences and backgrounds, the Board has adopted a Board diversity policy, which is set forth in the Board's Corporate Governance Principles as well as the Nominating Committee's written charter. Pursuant to the diversity policy, the Board is committed to seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills as part of each Board search the Company undertakes, and ensuring that Board nominees are drawn from a pool that includes diverse candidates, including women and minority candidates. 
As noted above, the Nominating Committee evaluates the current composition of the Board from time-to-time to ensure that the Directors reflect a diverse mix of skills, experiences, backgrounds and opinions. Depending on the current composition of the Board, the Nominating Committee may weigh certain factors, including those relating to diversity, more or less heavily when evaluating potential Director candidates. 
The Board and the Nominating Committee believe that the Company's current Directors, as a group, reflect the diverse mix of skills, experiences, backgrounds and opinions necessary to foster an effective decision-making environment and promote the Company's culture across the globe. Each of the Company's current Directors has significant experience working in international environments (including Directors who have lived and worked outside the United States for significant portions of their careers), and Board member experiences cover a wide range of industries.  Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
The first proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the election of eight Directors, each of whom has been recommended for election by the Board. If elected, the Directors will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified, subject to the Board's resignation requirement (as described in more detail below). 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the election of each of the following nominees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• J. F. Earl,  
• K. G. Eddy,  
• D. C. Everitt,  
• F. N. Grasberger III,  
• C. I. Haznedar,  
• M. Longhi,  
• E. M. Purvis, Jr., and  
• P. C. Widman.  
[END TABLE]
As discussed above, under the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in any uncontested election, each Director nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in order to be elected. This is known as a "majority voting standard." If any Director nominee fails to receive more "for" votes than votes "against" for his or her election, then such Director will be required by the Company's by-laws to tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. The Nominating Committee will then review the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it. The Board will act on the Nominating Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days following certification of the election results. In the event the Board determines not to accept the Director's resignation, the Board will also disclose the reasons such resignation was rejected. The Director who tendered his or her resignation will not participate in the Nominating Committee's recommendation or the Board's decision. If a Director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, then the Director who tendered that resignation will continue to serve on the Board until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, unconditional resignation or removal.  Nominees for Director 
All of the following Directors have been recommended for election by the Nominating Committee, and the Board has approved all such recommendations. Each of the following nominees for Director has accepted the nomination and has agreed to serve as a Director if elected by the Company's stockholders. 
The information set forth below states the name of each nominee for Director standing for re-election, his or her age (as of March 1, 2019), a listing of present and recent employment positions, the year in which he or she first became a Director of the Company, other directorships held, the nominee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that qualify him or her to serve as a Director and the committees of the Board on which the individual serves.

The Board held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Each Director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of Board and applicable committee meetings held during the period of 2019 for which he or she served as a Director. 
It is our policy to request that all Board members attend annual stockholder meetings. However, we also recognize that personal attendance by all Directors is not always possible. All Directors that served on the Board at the time of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2018 attended the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2018. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has established standing Audit, Management Development and Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. Membership in each of these committees, as of March 1, 2019, is shown in the following chart:

 Corporate Governance 
We have a long-standing commitment to good corporate governance practices. These practices come in many different forms and apply at all levels of our organization. They provide the Board and our senior management with a framework that defines responsibilities, sets high standards of professional and personal conduct and promotes compliance with our various financial, ethical, legal and other obligations and responsibilities. 
Corporate Governance Principles 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles that, along with the charters of the Board committees, provide the framework for our Board's operation and governance. The Nominating Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing our Corporate Governance Principles at least annually and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Corporate Governance Principles are available on our website at www.harsco.com/about-us in the Corporate Governance section. 
Code of Conduct 
We have adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to our Directors, officers and employees worldwide. The Code of Conduct is issued in booklet form and an online training program facilitates new employee orientation and individual refresher training. Our Code of Conduct is produced in over 20 languages. The Code of Conduct, including amendments thereto or waivers thereof granted to a Director or executive officer, if any, can be viewed on our website at www.harsco.com/about-us in the Corporate Governance section. 
Stockholder and Interested Party Communications with Directors 
The Board has established a formal process for stockholders and interested parties to communicate directly with the Lead Director, the non-management Directors or with any individual member of the Board. Stockholders and interested parties may contact any member of the Board by writing to the specific Board member in care of our Corporate Secretary at our Corporate Headquarters (350 Poplar Church Road, Camp Hill, PA 17011). Our Corporate Secretary will forward any such correspondence to the applicable Board member; provided, however, that any such correspondence that is considered by our Corporate Secretary to be improper for submission to the intended recipients will not be provided to such Directors. In addition, Board members, including the Lead Director, can be contacted by e-mail at BoardofDirectors@harsco.com. 
Director Independence 
The Board has affirmatively determined that the following seven Directors are independent pursuant to the applicable independence requirements set forth in the NYSE Rules and by the SEC because they either have no relationship with the Company (other than as a Director and stockholder) or because any relationship they have with the Company is immaterial: Messrs. Earl, Everitt, Longhi, Purvis and Widman and Ms. Eddy and Ms. Haznedar. In making these independence determinations, the Board, in consultation with the Nominating Committee, reviewed the direct and indirect relationships between each Director and the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the compensation and other payments each Director received from or made to the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Nominations of Directors 
The Nominating Committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of qualified nominees to serve as members of the Board. Consistent with the Board diversity policy, in administering its oversight responsibilities, the Nominating Committee is committed to seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills as part of each Board search the Company undertakes, and to ensuring that Board nominees are drawn from a pool that includes diverse candidates, including women and minority candidates. Beyond those specific parameters, the Nominating Committee has not adopted formal selection procedures, but instead utilizes general guidelines that allow it to adjust the selection process to best satisfy the objectives established for any Director search. The Nominating Committee considers Director candidates recommended by any reasonable source, including current Directors, management and stockholders. In the case of Ms. Haznedar, the Nominating Committee   considered the recommendations of a third-party search firm. Pursuant to its charter, the Nominating Committee has the authority to retain search firms to assist it in identifying candidates to serve as Directors and to approve the fees and other retention terms of any such firms. The Nominating Committee evaluates all Director candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of the recommendation of such Director candidate. The Nominating Committee will consider recommendations for Director candidates from stockholders if such recommendations are submitted in writing to: 
Corporate Secretary 
Harsco Corporation 
350 Poplar Church Road, Camp Hill, PA 17011 
Any such written recommendation from stockholders must set forth the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full legal name, address and telephone number of the stockholder recommending the Director candidate for consideration  and whether that stockholder is acting on behalf of or in concert with other beneficial owners, and, if so, the same information with respect to them;

• A written, signed and notarized acknowledgement from the proposed nominee consenting to such recommendation by the  recommending stockholder, confirming that he or she will serve as a Director, if so elected, and consenting to our undertaking of an investigation into his or her background, experience and qualifications, any direct or indirect relationship with  the recommending stockholder, the Company, our Directors or management or 5% stockholders, or interests in proposals or matters, and any other matter reasonably deemed relevant by the Nominating Committee to its considerations of such person as a  potential Director candidate.  
[END TABLE]
This information must be submitted as provided under the heading "STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS FOR PRESENTATION AT 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS." 
There were no material changes to the procedures relating to stockholder nominations during 2018, and there have been no changes to date in 2019. The Nominating Committee believes that these procedural requirements are intended solely to ensure that it has a sufficient basis on which to assess potential Director candidates and are not intended to discourage or interfere with appropriate stockholder nominations. The Nominating Committee does not believe that any such requirements subject any stockholder or proposed nominee to any unreasonable burden. The Nominating Committee and the Board reserve the right to change the above procedural requirements from time to time and/or to waive some or all of the foregoing requirements with respect to certain nominees, but any such waiver shall not preclude the Nominating Committee from insisting upon compliance with any and all of the above requirements by any other recommending stockholder or proposed nominees.  Non-Employee Director Compensation 
The general policy of our Board is that compensation for non-employee Directors should be competitive with similarly situated companies and should be comprised of a mix of cash and equity. Our Nominating Committee annually reviews market data regarding comparable director compensation programs. This data is prepared by management and the independent compensation consultant utilizing several broad board compensation studies completed within one year of the Nominating Committee's review. 
The compensation structure for non-employee Directors for 2018 was as follows:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Non-Executive Chairman premium is paid in addition to the annual retainer. The  Lead Director retained the Non-Executive Chairman premium upon election as Lead Director.  
(2)  Committee chair retainers are paid in lieu of, not in addition to, committee member retainers.  
(3)  For each Board or applicable committee meeting held in a given year in excess of twice the number of regularly scheduled  meetings established at the beginning of such year, the non-employee Directors will receive a per meeting fee equal to $1,500 (for in-person/telephonic Board meetings  and in-person committee meetings) or $750 (for telephonic committee meetings).  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the above listed compensation, Directors are reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses related to attendance at Board or committee meetings. 
Our Board has instituted a stockholding requirement for Board members equal to five times the annual retainer. Board members have five years from the date they join the Board to comply with this requirement. Vested and unvested Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), as well as phantom shares acquired through deferral of Director fees (as described below), are included for purposes of determining compliance with Director stockholding requirements. At December 31, 2018, all of our non-employee Directors who had served for at least five years were in compliance with Director stockholding requirements. 
Beginning in 2016, RSUs are granted under the new 2016 Non-Employee Directors' Long-Term Equity Compensation Plan (the "Director Plan"). Each RSU under the Director Plan vests at the close of business on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the annual meeting of stockholders in the year immediately following the year of grant, subject to accelerated vesting in full if service as a Director terminates due to death, disability or under a   mandatory retirement policy, and subject to pro rata vesting in the event of termination of service in other circumstances. Each RSU will be settled by issuance of a share of our common stock. Dividend equivalents on the RSUs are not paid prior to vesting, but are settled thereafter. 
The Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors allows each non-employee Director to defer all or a portion of his or her Director compensation, including RSU grant, until some future date selected by the Director. Pursuant to the Director's election, the accumulated deferred compensation is held in either an interest-bearing account or a Company phantom share account. The interest-bearing deferred account accumulates notional interest on the account balance at a rate equal to the five-year United States Treasury Note yield rate in effect from time to time. Contributions to the phantom share account are recorded as notional shares of the Company's Common Stock. Deferred amounts are credited to the Director's account quarterly on the 15th of February, May, August and November. The number of phantom shares recorded is equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that the deferred compensation would have purchased at the market price of the stock on the day the account is credited. Dividend equivalents are earned on the phantom shares and are credited to the account as additional phantom shares. All phantom shares are non-voting and payments out of the account are made solely in cash, based upon the market price of the Common Stock on the date of payment selected by the Director. Under certain circumstances, the accounts may be paid out early upon termination of directorship following a change in control. 
Directors who are actively employed by us receive no additional compensation for serving as Directors, and we do not pay consulting or professional service fees to Directors.

Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is currently composed of four Directors, each of whom is considered independent under the rules of the NYSE and the SEC. The Board has determined that each of Ms. Eddy and Mr. Widman qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under the rules promulgated by the SEC. 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that complies with the guidelines established by the NYSE. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring our financial reporting processes and system of internal controls, supervising our internal auditors and overseeing the independence and performance of the independent auditors. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with our internal auditors and our independent auditors to review the overall scope and plans for their respective audits of our financial statements. The Audit Committee also meets privately (and in separate meetings) with members of management, our independent auditors and our internal auditors following each Audit Committee meeting and as may otherwise be needed. The Audit Committee meets with management and with the independent auditors each quarter to review and discuss our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q prior to their being filed with the SEC, and meets with management and our independent auditors to review and discuss our quarterly earnings prior to their release. 
The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee the audit and financial reporting processes. However, the members of the Audit Committee rely, without independent verification, on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management, and the report issued by the independent registered public accounting firm. While the Audit Committee and the Board monitor our financial record keeping and controls, management is ultimately responsible for our financial reporting process, including our system of internal controls, disclosure control procedures and the preparation of the financial statements. The independent auditors support the financial reporting process by performing an audit of our financial statements and issuing a report thereon. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditors the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and related periods. These discussions focused on the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles used by us, key accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements and the reasonableness of significant judgments made by management in the preparation of the financial statements and alternatives that may be available. 
In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the quality of our accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditors the independent auditors' independence. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the report of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included (and the Board approved such inclusion) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has considered the possible effect of non-audit services on the auditors' independence and pre-approved the type of non-audit services that were rendered. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy authorizing the pre-approval of certain audit, non-audit and tax services (and related fees) to be provided by the independent auditors. The services to be provided are to be reviewed with the Audit Committee and approval is given for a specific dollar amount and for a period of not greater than 12 months. Services that are not pre-approved in this manner must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis throughout the year. Additionally, if the pre-approved fee is exceeded, the Audit Committee must be advised of such overruns. In making its decision regarding the approval of services, the Audit Committee will consider whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, whether the independent auditor is best positioned to provide such services and whether the services might enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. No services were provided during the last two fiscal years pursuant to the de minimis safe harbor exception from the pre-approval requirements. 
All of the fees included in the table above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  Proposal 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although not required to do so, the Board has determined to submit the Audit Committee's appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors to stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. In the absence of contrary direction from stockholders, all proxies that are submitted will be voted in favor of the ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors. 
If this proposal is not ratified by at least a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on matters at the Annual Meeting, the appointment of the independent auditors will be reevaluated by the Audit Committee. Due to the difficulty and expense of making any substitution of auditors, it is unlikely that their appointment for the audit of the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 would be changed. However, the Audit Committee may review whether to seek new independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. 
A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will attend the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement and answer questions of stockholders. 
Required Vote: The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors will be approved if it receives the approval of at least a majority of the shares represented at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  Compensation Discussion & Analysis

Executive Summary 
Business Highlights 
During 2018, the Company continued to deliver on its long-term strategy of generating financial returns in excess of the cost of capital and maintaining a strong financial profile. Harsco management successfully executed several initiatives to further strengthen and grow its existing businesses by exceeding its 2018 Annual Operating Plan goals and achieving other key business objectives. 
In particular, the Company also accelerated its growth-focused investments in 2018 with Metal & Minerals' ("M&M") acquisition of the Altek Group, a high-growth company that provides global innovative environmental solutions to the aluminum industry. This acquisition expands the breadth our service capabilities into aluminum dross and scrap processing as well as providing breakthrough technology solutions aimed at providing value to our customers' waste streams. Success in delivering against our strategic initiatives, along with a more favorable economic climate, resulted in strong 2018 financial performance and notable year-over-year improvements of key performance indicators ("KPIs").

Through product and service innovation, returns earned on growth-focused investments, sound financial management and delivering relevant and sustainable value to our customers, the outlook for each of Harsco's business units remains positive for 2019.  Compensation Highlights 
Our executive compensation program's primary objective is aligning our executive's pay with the interests of our stockholders. The program is also designed to reward short-and long-term financial, strategic and operational business results, while facilitating the Company's need to attract, motivate, develop and retain highly-qualified executives who are critical to our long-term success. 
Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, stockholders voted strongly in support of Harsco's NEO compensation programs with approximately 95% of votes cast in support of the Harsco's say-on-pay proposal. 
We continue to engage our stockholders on various issues through an extensive and thoughtful investor relations program. During this engagement, stockholders have an opportunity to provide feedback on a variety of topics, including executive compensation. The Company's outreach via investor conferences, roadshows, and other means has increased and we have received strong favorable support from our stockholders the past few years. The MD&C Committee considers stockholders' viewpoints in the development and approval of all compensation policies and practices at Harsco.

 Changes for 2018 
In 2018, the MD&C Committee and management partnered closely to adopt the following changes to the Company's pay program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary   The MD&C Committee approved base salary increases to NEOs ranging from 3% to 8%, effective May 1, 2018.   NEOs received increases in recognition of their contributions to the Company including those described in the Business Highlights, positioning  relative to market practices and overall merit increase budget for Harsco in the U.S. 
 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") Targets   The MD&C Committee approved increases to LTIP targets for the Company's CEO and three other NEOs beginning with the 2018  grants.   The MD&C Committee made these changes in consideration of each NEO's compensation as compared to  market practices, additional responsibilities assumed by the executives and their individual performance. 
 2018 PSU Design    Effective with the 2018 grant, the PSU payout will be capped at 100%  ("target") if TSR is negative over the performance measurement period. Previously, payout was set to zero if TSR was negative.   Additionally, the CEO's mix of PSUs as a percent of his LTIP award was increased from 33% to 40% for 2018.      The new approach is consistent with the prevailing market  practice for companies that cap payouts for negative TSR.   The CEO's PSU mix was adjusted  to place more emphasis on performance contingent awards.

[END TABLE]
For 2018, all three business units earned an annual incentive payout based on their financial performance as compared against the approved Business Unit Contribution ("BUC") targets. Harsco BUC consists of two distinct and separate components: 1) operating income (excluding the effect of certain special items as determined by the MD&C Committee) minus; 2) a fixed cost of capital rate applied to planned controllable net assets deployed. Upon consolidation of each business unit's results including Corporate charges, Harsco Consolidated earned an above target payout. The payout factors achieved related to Harsco Consolidated and each of three business units are noted below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Harsco Consolidated      137% of Target 
 Harsco  M&M      118% of Target 
 Harsco Rail      113% of Target 
 Harsco Industrial      120% of Target 
[END TABLE]
 The resulting payouts from the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") along with the base salary earned plus the long-term incentives granted in 2018 for the NEOs are presented in the table below.

  (1)  Total Direct Compensation is equal to the sum of base salary earned, AIP earned for 2018 and paid in 2019 and accounting  fair value of long-term incentives granted in 2018.    
[END TABLE]
Long-term incentives granted in March of 2018 are considered by the MD&C Committee to be a pay opportunity with the realizable value fully dependent on Harsco's future share price performance. The CEO's long-term incentives consist of 40% PSUs, 30% SARs and 30% Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). For all other NEOs, long-term incentives consist of one-third PSUs, SARs and RSUs. 
The Company granted PSUs in 2016 with vesting conditioned generally on Harsco's TSR performance relative to the S&P 600 Industrial Index for the three-year period from 2016 through 2018. Harsco's TSR for the performance period was at the 96th percentile of the index, resulting in a payout of 200% of target.  Discussion and Analysis of 2018 Compensation

Talent Management Strategy 
Integral with our guiding principles is our talent management strategy developed by management and supported by both the Company's MD&C Committee and the Board of Directors. Delivering our strategic goals and driving positive stockholder return requires a strong focus on attracting and retaining a talented senior management team. 
Annually, an organizational leadership review is performed, which assesses the critical organizational capabilities required to execute the Company's strategy, executive team performance, succession depth, and retention risk across all critical executive leadership positions. Feedback is sought from both the MD&C Committee and the Board of Directors. In addition, Board members are involved in the selection process for our NEOs.  Overview of 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions 
Applying our principles and stated compensation practices, the MD&C Committee reviewed each NEO's compensation package individually with the objective of supporting our business strategies, ensuring market competitiveness, providing incentives to motivate and retain our key executives, and underpinning our succession planning process. 
Elements of 2018 NEO Compensation Program 
The key elements of our 2018 NEO compensation program are described in the following table:

 Compensation Decision-Making Framework 
General Process 
Executive compensation decisions at the Company are the product of several factors, in each case subject to modification by the MD&C Committee as it may deem necessary in its discretion, and also dependent upon whether the decisions are made in the normal pay setting cycle or under special circumstances for a newly appointed or hired executive. For 2018, the predominant factors influencing pay determinations for our NEOs included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance against the BUC performance target;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategic initiatives, including creating and implementing a growth strategy in the M&M business unit; driving growth in  the Industrial business unit; executing cost and operational improvements in the Rail business unit; and further improving the balance sheet position;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of specific operational goals relating to the sphere of influence of the applicable NEO; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market competitive compensation levels reflected in survey data and peer group data as described in more detail below.   
[END TABLE]
Below are the roles for the MD&C Committee, the Chairman, President & CEO, and the Compensation Consultants regarding the Compensation Decision-Making process. 
Roles 
MD&C Committee 
All members of the MD&C Committee were independent Directors, enabling them to be objective representatives for our stockholders. The MD&C Committee oversaw the design and development of our 2018 NEO compensation program and determined our CEO's compensation consistent with the overall objectives of the program. In addition, the MD&C Committee also approved all incentive compensation plans and approved or revised recommendations made by the Chairman, President & CEO for compensation decisions affecting any of the other NEOs. 
Chairman, President & CEO 
Our Chairman, President & CEO, assisted by our Human Resources department, administered the executive compensation program as delegated by the MD&C Committee. Mr. Grasberger met with the MD&C Committee and, in consultation with the Compensation Consultant, made recommendations related to the overall structure for our NEO compensation program, set and evaluated 2018 AIP metrics and made specific recommendations regarding the form and amount of compensation opportunities for the other NEOs. 
Final decisions regarding NEO compensation are always made by the MD&C Committee, and the Chairman, President & CEO does not play any role with respect to his own compensation. 
Independent Compensation Consultants 
Our MD&C Committee has the authority to engage and retain an independent compensation consultant to provide independent counsel and advice. At least annually, the MD&C Committee formally conducts an evaluation as to the effectiveness of the independent compensation consultant and periodically runs a request for proposal process to ensure the independent compensation consultant is meeting its needs. For 2018, our MD&C Committee engaged Pay Governance LLC through February and then engaged Pearl Meyer through the remainder of the year. Pearl Meyer was selected as the independent consultant after an extensive review process conducted by the MD&C Committee based on clearly stated selection criteria including applicable expertise within our industry segment, reputation, and application of compensation philosophy with the MD&C Committee and the Company's management team.  The following services were provided by the Independent Compensation Consultants in 2018:

[END TABLE]
At the MD&C Committee's direction during 2018, management provided all MD&C Committee materials to the independent consultant and discussed such materials and any recommendations relating thereto with the consultant in advance of each MD&C Committee meeting. Pearl Meyer considered and discussed the information with the MD&C Committee chairperson, specifically identifying any issues or concerns. The MD&C Committee considered Pearl Meyer's input as part of its decision-making process. 
Pay Governance also provided consulting related to non-employee Director compensation directly to the Nominating and Governance Committee. 
Independence Assessment: No Compensation Consultant Conflicts of Interest 
The MD&C Committee assessed the independence of both Pay Governance and Pearl Meyer in 2018, as required under NYSE listing rules. The MD&C Committee has also considered and assessed all relevant factors, including but not limited to those set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) under the Exchange Act, that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to the compensation consultant described above. Based on this review, we are not aware of any conflict of interest raised by the work performed by Pay Governance or Pearl Meyer that would prevent the consultant from serving as an independent consultant to the MD&C Committee. 
Management Consultants 
Our Human Resources department retained Willis Towers Watson during 2018 to provide additional executive compensation support, including guidance related to the CEO Pay Ratio disclosure requirements. Our Human Resources department also used various survey data compiled by Willis Towers Watson to provide information to the MD&C Committee as part of its decision-making processes. 
In 2018, Willis Towers Watson again provided pension plan-related and other similar advice to our Human Resources and Finance departments as well as measurement support for various casualty exposures. The decision to engage Willis Towers Watson for these non-compensation related services was made by management. 
How We Used Market Data for 2018 Pay Decisions 
Our first step in establishing pay levels for each of our NEOs is to target compensation initially at or near the median (50th percentile) of market data for executives in similar positions. In reviewing the 2018 compensation of our NEOs, the MD&C Committee references two sources of market data when making compensation decisions: survey data and peer group data.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Survey data: The MD&C Committee consulted with Pay Governance to review third-party compensation surveys focused  on capital goods, industrial manufacturing and commodity-based companies reflecting similar revenue size to Harsco. As we are a diversified industrial services company, no other company perfectly matches our profile, and we believe our most direct  competitors for executive talent are not necessarily limited to the companies included in our peer group. The MD&C Committee does not materially rely upon data from any individual company participating in any of the surveys in making  compensation decisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Peer Group data: The MD&C Committee also consulted with Pay Governance to review peer group  compensation data obtained from SEC filings to help us understand the pay levels in industries in which we compete for talent. Peer group data is focused on elements of compensation (base salary, annual bonus, and long-term incentives) for NEOs at  companies with comparable revenues, market capitalization, industry focus, number of employees, global (multi-national) footprint, and other similar business-related factors. Our peer group used in making compensation decisions ("Compensation  Peer Group") for 2018 is listed below. All components of the Company's NEO compensation packages, as well as the aggregate target total compensation (the sum of base salary, target annual incentives, and target long-term incentives) levels  for the NEOs, are initially targeted to the 50th percentile of similarly situated employees of companies in the comparison Compensation Peer Group and relevant survey data. Variation above or below the 50th percentile results when, in the judgment  of the MD&C Committee, the value of the NEO's experience, performance, scope and/or specific skills, together with his or her ability to impact business results, or other business conditions, justify the variation. Variation can also result  based upon the terms of individually negotiated employment arrangements and year-to-year fluctuations in the Peer Group data and/or the survey data.   
[END TABLE]
Compensation Peer Group 
Each year, we review our Compensation Peer Group to ensure our compensation is being benchmarked to comparable companies considering industry, financial and operational similarities. In late 2017, upon review of the 2017 Compensation Peer Group and the agreed upon selection criteria which is noted below, the MD&C Committee, in conjunction with Pay Governance, determined no changes were required to the 19 publicly-traded companies to serve as the Compensation Peer Group for 2018. As in previous years, the following selection criteria was used in the development of the Compensation Peer Group: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversified industrial organizations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Global (multi-national) footprint, operating in many individual locations with approximately 30% or more of total revenues  deriving from outside the United States;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Asset/capital intensive nature and/or long-term contract service providers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sized to be approximately one half to 2.5 times our size as measured by revenues and within a reasonable range on a market  cap basis.  
[END TABLE]
 Companies included in the 2018 Compensation Peer Group were companies that had one or more business aspects that corresponded with one or more of the main aspects of our three business units: M&M, Rail, and Industrial. The following companies comprise the 2018 Compensation Peer Group:

For the 2018 Compensation Peer Group, median revenue for 2018 (2017 data was utilized to determine 2018 NEO compensation) was approximately $1.5 billion (as compared to the Company's 2018 revenues of approximately $1.7 billion) and median market capitalization as of September 30, 2018 was approximately $1.9 billion (as compared to the Company's 2018 market capitalization of approximately $2.3 billion). The following charts illustrate Harsco's position in comparison to the 2018 Compensation Peer Group's median by total revenue and market capitalization measured as of September 30, 2018. 
In 2018, upon review of the 2018 Compensation Peer Group and the selection criteria noted above, the MD&C Committee approved the recommendation of Pearl Meyer to remove American Railcar Industries, Inc. and add three new companies - Meritor, Inc., The Timken Company and ITT Inc. to the Compensation Peer Group for 2019 due to the Company's growing market capitalization and revenue size. Although there are other companies who compete with Harsco's various business segments, some were not included in the compensation peer set due to their differences in size and scope as compared to Harsco.  The 21 companies in our new 2019 Compensation Peer Group will be discussed in our 2020 Proxy Statement. 
Initial Benchmarking 
In reviewing base salaries, target total cash compensation, and target total compensation for 2018, the MD&C Committee initially targeted each NEO's compensation opportunity at the 50th percentile of both the Compensation Peer Group data and survey data. The MD&C Committee believes NEOs should not be compensated at either the high or low end of compensation as compared to the market, but rather should receive a reasonable level of compensation based on both the Company's overall performance and their individual performance. The MD&C Committee then sets final compensation amounts either above or below the initial benchmarks, specifically taking into account: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Differences in the scope of responsibilities held by the NEOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance (specifically the effect of what the MD&C Committee viewed as exceptional performance) of duties during a  NEO's tenure with Harsco;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market requirements; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Length of service with the Company in specific positions.  
[END TABLE]
While past performance is considered by the MD&C Committee in setting current year target compensation opportunities, the effect of current performance is much more significant in determining the level at which those compensation opportunities are earned and paid out. Our program provides each NEO an opportunity to earn a competitive level of compensation each year if we achieve our pre-established objectives, with an opportunity to earn greater amounts by helping us exceed those targets or lesser amounts when performance falls short of targets. 
Impact of NEO Individual Performance on 2018 Compensation 
The compensation structure for the Chairman, President & CEO is designed to deliver approximately 18% of the annual compensation opportunity in the form of base salary (fixed compensation) and the remaining 82% in the form of variable compensation (target annual incentive compensation and target long-term equity-based compensation). The actual amount of compensation realized by the CEO may vary from this target based upon performance evaluated under the terms of our variable compensation plans. Once per year, the MD&C Committee completes an evaluation with respect to the Company's goals and objectives and makes a report to the Board. Based upon this assessment, the CEO's compensation was set for the 2018 fiscal year, including base salary, annual incentive target, long-term equity-based compensation, perquisites, and other benefits. When evaluating the total level of CEO compensation for the 2018 fiscal year, the MD&C Committee considered the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Personal performance against pre-established goals and objectives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's performance and relative TSR; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation of CEOs at comparable companies, as reflected in the benchmark compensation data.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to setting the compensation for the other NEOs, the MD&C Committee strives to deliver a competitive level of total compensation to each of the NEOs by evaluating and balancing the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The strategic importance of the position within our executive team;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The overall performance level of the individual and the potential to make significant contributions to the Company in the  future;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of the position in the marketplace;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Internal pay equity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation structure and guiding principles.  
[END TABLE]
 Target total direct compensation for our NEOs other than the Chairman, President & CEO is designed to deliver approximately 67% variable compensation at target performance and 33% of base salary (fixed compensation). The amounts of compensation realized by our NEOs will vary from the target awards based upon performance evaluated under the terms of our compensation plans. 
Each year, the Chairman, President & CEO presents his Organizational Leadership Review to the MD&C Committee to discuss the individual performance and potential of each of the NEOs. Following this review, the Chairman, President & CEO submits compensation recommendations to the MD&C Committee for each NEO. These recommendations address all elements of compensation, including base salary, target annual incentive compensation, long-term equity-based compensation, perquisites, and other benefits. In evaluating these compensation recommendations, the MD&C Committee considers information such as the NEOs' individual performance, the performance of the Company, and the compensation of similarly situated executive officers as determined by the referenced benchmark data. The MD&C Committee applies the same considerations as noted above when making its compensation decisions for the Chairman, President & CEO. 
2018 Compensation Decision Details 
Base Salary 
Base salary represents a stable source of income (fixed compensation) and is a standard element of compensation necessary to attract and retain talent. Base salary is set at the MD&C Committee's discretion after taking into account the competitive landscape including the compensation practices of the companies in our selected Compensation Peer Group and survey data from a broader index of comparable companies, our business strategy, our short- and long-term performance goals, and individual factors, such as position, salary history, individual performance and contribution, an individual's length of service with the Company, and placement within the general base salary range offered to our NEOs. 
Effective May 1, 2018, NEOs received increases in their annual base salaries, in recognition of their contributions to the Company, overall positioning relative to market data, as well as the overall merit increase budget for Harsco in the U.S. The table below reflects the year-over-year changes in base salary approved by the MD&C Committee and effective as of January 1, 2019:

 2018 AIP Awards 
NEOs were eligible to participate in the 2018 AIP program, which provides the opportunity to earn a performance-based cash incentive based on the achievement of near-term financial results and strategic goals. All NEOs were evaluated, in significant part, based on overall Company performance to improve financial results and drive stockholder value. In its decision-making authority, the MD&C Committee reviewed the targets as established based on the 2018 Annual Operating Plan set at the beginning of the year versus actual financial results. The MD&C Committee is given discretion to reduce (but not increase) the final payout amounts for the NEOs. 
Setting 2018 AIP Award Opportunities 
Target annual incentive opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary and payouts can range from 0% to 200% of target award amounts based on financial performance. Targets were established by the MD&C Committee based on each NEO's level of responsibilities and his or her ability to impact our overall results, as well as consideration of the benchmarking data as previously discussed. For 2018, there were no changes to target annual incentive levels for NEOs.

AIP Performance Metrics and Payouts 
Our annual cash incentive plan, the AIP, is intended to: 
For 2018, all AIP payouts for NEOs were entirely dependent upon achievement of BUC performance. Performance metrics, weights and goals were developed based upon our annual operating plans, as approved by the Board, to drive alignment with commitments made to our stockholders. Specific weightings between Harsco Consolidated BUC and Business Unit BUC for each NEO is presented in the table below.

Actual Harsco Consolidated BUC achieved was $72.3 million, driven by improved operating income performance from the successful execution of business and cost control initiatives, favorable end market trends, higher commodity prices, and lower overhead costs. The MD&C Committee gave careful consideration and assessment of the management team's achievement against the established goals. As contemplated when setting the targets, certain adjustments were made due to the impact on annual results of certain nonrecurring, unusual items. The net adjustments reduced operating income by ($3.8) million. The adjustment for the capital component totaled $5.6 million for the capital charge associated with the Company's 2018 acquisition of the Altek business in its Metals & Minerals segment. These adjustments were determined by the MD&C Committee to be excluded from the calculation of BUC since they did not directly reflect company or management performance and are unusual and infrequent in nature. The 2018 AIP calculations and results are noted in the table below.  At the business unit level, Mr. Gill's incentive awards are determined using an equal weighting between Harsco Consolidated BUC and Harsco Rail BUC. Mr. Gill's annual goals are a balance between critical contributions to overall Harsco performance with the specific strategic initiatives of the Rail business unit. For 2018, BUC performance for Harsco Rail was $30.6 million, resulting in a payout factor of 113% for Mr. Gill on the business unit component, and when including the Harsco Consolidated performance result, Mr. Gill's combined payout factor was 125% and he was awarded $334,725. The 2018 AIP calculations and results were as follows for the NEOs:

Setting 2018 Long-Term Award Opportunities 
Target long-term incentive opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary and the realized value is dependent on stock price and total shareholder return over a specified period of time. Targets were established by the MD&C Committee based on each NEO's level of responsibilities and his or her ability to impact our overall results, as well as consideration of the benchmarking data previously discussed. 
For the LTIP award cycle granted in 2018, the MD&C Committee and the Board established the grant level for each NEO as a percentage of that NEO's base salary. The MD&C Committee and the Board set target values for the 2018 LTIP awards with the intent that each NEO's total direct compensation opportunity falls within a reasonable range of the market median for the NEO's position. See the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2018" table for more information.  At its February 2018 meeting, the MD&C Committee increased long term incentive targets for some of our NEOs. The MD&C Committee made these changes in consideration of the executive's compensation as compared to peer companies, additional responsibilities assumed by the executive, tenure and individual performance. The table below reflects long-term incentive targets approved by the MD&C Committee:

Vesting of 2016 to 2018 Performance Share Unit Plan 
The Company granted performance share units in 2016 with vesting conditioned on Harsco's TSR performance relative to the S&P 600 Industrial Index for the three-year period from 2016 through 2018. Harsco's TSR result for the period equaled the 96th percentile of the index, resulting in a payout at 200% of the units granted in 2016. 
Other Compensation Elements 
During 2018, we provided our NEOs with the following broad-based employee benefits on the same terms that apply to our non-executive U.S. employees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Health insurance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disability insurance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A term life insurance benefit equal to two times the individual's salary up to a maximum benefit of $500,000; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 401(k) plan participation.  
[END TABLE]
Since defined benefit plan accruals for Harsco's U.S. executives were frozen effective December 31, 2008, we continue to note the change in pension value representing the net effect of interest adjustments (in other words, change in present value due to shortening of the discount period) and changes in assumptions used to estimate present values. Our NEOs are also eligible to participate in the Non-Qualified Retirement Savings and Investment Plan ("NQ RSIP"), which supplements the RSIP with respect to contributions that could not be made because of Internal Revenue Service compensation and contribution limitations. 
We provided other benefits to certain NEOs during 2018. While rarely used, the Board maintains a policy regarding our Chairman, President & CEO's personal use of our corporate aircraft. In the event of personal use of the corporate aircraft,   our Chairman, President & CEO is taxed on the imputed income attributable to personal use of our aircraft, and our Chairman, President & CEO does not receive a tax gross-up from us with respect to such imputed amounts. 
We offer limited perquisites and other personal benefits to our NEOs at competitive levels with those provided by our Peer Group companies, as well as the larger group of companies within the general industry that are similar in overall size and relative performance. We believe the other benefits we provided to our NEOs were necessary to help us attract and retain our senior executive team and the values of these benefits were reasonable, competitive, and consistent with the overall executive compensation program. 
For more information on the perquisites and certain other benefits provided to the NEOs in 2018, see the All Other Compensation Table that serves as a supplement to the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
Employment Arrangements with NEOs 
The Company is not a party to any employment agreements with its NEOs. Additionally, no offer letter arrangements were outstanding between our NEOs and the Company in 2018. 
Potential Payments upon Change in Control and Other Potential Post-Employment Payments 
Change in Control Severance Agreements 
We are currently a party to change in control severance agreements with Messrs. Grasberger, Minan, Hochman, Gill and Ms. McKenzie. These change in control severance agreements reflect what we believe to be a market-based approach to a potential change in control scenario and incorporated several stockholder-favored compensation practices, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Double-trigger" payment provisions that require a qualifying termination of employment after a change in control  before benefits and payments are received; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No excise tax gross-ups on severance benefits (each NEO will either pay the excise  taxes on his or her severance benefits or the severance benefits will be reduced to a point where the excise tax does not apply, depending on which result is more favorable to the executive).  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Grasberger is entitled to receive double-trigger severance benefits equal to three times his highest base salary in effect during the period beginning 90 days prior to the change in control through the date of termination, plus three times his highest target annual incentive for the year of termination. Each of Messrs. Minan, Hochman, Gill and Ms. McKenzie is entitled to receive double-trigger severance benefits equal to two times his or her highest base salary in effect during the period beginning 90 days prior to the change in control through the date of termination, plus two times his or her highest target annual incentive for the year of termination. Each change in control severance agreement provides for a rolling three-year term that renews each year, subject to certain exceptions. 
The change in control severance agreements are reviewed on a regular basis, though not necessarily as part of the annual compensation review. The MD&C Committee believes the change in control severance agreements serve the following purposes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assure we have the continued dedication and full attention of certain key employees prior to and after the consummation of a  change in control event;

• Help ensure, if a possible change in control should arise and a change in control officer should be involved in  deliberations or negotiations in connection with the possible change in control, such officer would be in a position to consider as objectively as possible whether the possible change in control transaction is in our best interest as well as the  best interests of our stockholders, without concern for his or her position or financial well-being; and

• Protect us by retaining key talent in the face of corporate changes.  
[END TABLE]
 Other Potential Post Employment Payments 
Upon certain types of terminations of employment not related to a change in control, payments under various Company policies and plans may be paid to NEOs. These events and amounts are more fully explained under the heading "Termination or Change in Control Arrangements." 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In 2018, we continued to maintain stock ownership guidelines that applied to the NEOs. Our stock ownership guidelines encourage the retention of stock acquired through our LTIP awards. No shares may be sold by participants until their applicable ownership guidelines are satisfied, subject to a hardship exception administered by the MD&C Committee. 
The stock ownership guidelines are established as a multiple of each NEO's base salary and were benchmarked against the stock ownership guidelines for similarly situated executives at Peer Group companies. They were also based on the Board's determination of appropriate share ownership levels based on our compensation system. Under the guidelines, each NEO is encouraged to own a specific amount of our common stock and is restricted from selling shares until the guideline has been satisfied. The share ownership levels (based on fair market value as measured periodically) for each NEO for 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name      Three Times Salary      Six Times Salary   
 Name      Three Times Salary      Six Times Salary   
 F. Nicholas  Grasberger III       ✓ 
 Peter F.  Minan   ✓     
 Russell C.  Hochman   ✓     
 Tracey L.  McKenzie   ✓     
 Jeswant S.  Gill   ✓     
[END TABLE]
Our NEOs have five years from the date they are first granted LTIP awards to comply with the guidelines. If a NEO is promoted into a position with greater ownership requirements, that individual has five additional years to comply with the new guideline. All common stock held by the NEOs, whether acquired as a result of an LTIP award or otherwise, is included in determining whether they have achieved the applicable ownership guideline. Unvested stock options and unvested SARs are not included in calculating whether the guidelines have been met. Failure to meet the guidelines within the applicable five-year period will result in a review by the MD&C Committee to determine the cause of such failure and to develop an appropriate corrective action plan. 
As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Grasberger, Minan and Hochman along with Ms. McKenzie have met their ownership guidelines while Mr. Gill was within the five-year phase-in period for meeting his ownership guidelines and continues to accumulate shares. 
Right to Recover Incentive Compensation 
Consistent with the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the Company and the Board reserve the right to recover (or "clawback") from certain current and/or former key employees any wrongfully earned performance-based compensation, including stock-based awards, under the following circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There is a restatement of Company financials due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board determines the current or former employee has willfully committed an act of fraud, dishonesty or recklessness in  the performance of his or her duties that contributed to the noncompliance that resulted in the requirement to restate Company financials; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The cash incentive or performance-based equity compensation would have been less valuable than what was actually awarded or  paid based upon the application of the correct financial results.  
[END TABLE]
 These provisions are designed to deter and prevent detrimental behavior and to protect our investors from financial misconduct. 
Policies on Hedging and Pledging of Shares 
Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all Board members, employees, including corporate officers, from engaging in any transaction in which they may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of the Company securities (or "hedging"). For this purpose, "hedging" includes "short-sales" (selling borrowed securities which the seller hopes can be purchased at a lower price in the future) or "short sales against the box" (selling owned, but not delivered securities), "put" and "call" options (publicly available rights to sell or buy securities within a certain period of time at a specified price or the like), and other hedging transactions designed to minimize the risk inherent in owning Common Stock, such as zero-cost collars and forward sales contracts. 
Additionally, Board members and executives are prohibited from pledging shares as collateral for a loan or in a margin account. 
Policy Regarding Tax and Accounting Impact on Executive Compensation 
The MD&C Committee annually reviews and considers the deductibility of the compensation paid to our executive officers, which includes each of the NEOs. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the exemption for qualifying performance-based compensation was repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, compensation paid to our executive officers (on or after January 1, 2018) in excess of $1 million is generally not deductible unless it qualifies for certain transition relief. While the Company will monitor guidance and developments in this area, the MD&C Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards the executive talent necessary for our success. Consequently, the MD&C Committee may pay or provide compensation that is not tax deductible or is otherwise limited as to tax deductibility. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The MD&C Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis set forth above with management. Based on this review and discussion, the MD&C Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and our Proxy Statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, for filing with the SEC.

The foregoing report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A promulgated by the SEC or Section 18 of the Exchange Act.  Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management 
In 2018, Pearl Meyer, along with senior management, reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all employees. They concluded, and the MD&C Committee concurred, that any risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company. In addition, we reviewed the relationship between our risk management policies and practices and the incentive compensation we provide to our NEOs and other key employees to confirm that our incentive compensation does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. The findings of these reviews indicated that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation program provides a balance between our short-term and long-term goals and objectives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under our compensation program, the highest amount of compensation can be achieved through consistent superior performance  over sustained periods of time, which discourages short-term risk taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive awards are capped by the MD&C Committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership guidelines, the clawback policy, and prohibition on hedging mitigate excessive risk taking.   
[END TABLE]
Furthermore, as described above, compensation decisions may include the subjective use of negative discretion, which has the ability to restrain the influence of formulae or objective factors on excessive risk taking.  2018 Summary Compensation Table 
The following table presents the compensation provided to our NEOs for services rendered to us in 2016, 2017 and 2018, as applicable:

      The amounts for the PSUs granted in 2018 reflect a Monte-Carlo simulation that considers the probable outcome of the  performance condition as of the grant date, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718. For these amounts, see the "Grant Date  Fair Value of Stock and SAR/Option Awards" column of the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table below. The following are the values of the 2018 PSUs as of the grant date assuming attainment of the maximum level of performance:  Mr. Grasberger, $3,399,932; Mr. Minan, $753,484; Mr. Hochman, $467,757; Ms. McKenzie, $461,372; and Mr. Gill, $400,656.

In order for each NEO to realize any value upon exercise of the SARs, the market price of our Common Stock must then be above $19.80 per share.

[END TABLE]
2018 Pension Benefits 
None of our NEOs are covered under the Harsco Employees' Pension Plan (the "HEPP"), therefore no future payments are expected. 
2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table 
The following table describes the nonqualified deferred compensation of the NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   Plan Name    Executive Contributions in Last FY ($)    Registrant Contributions in Last FY ($)(1)    Aggregate Earnings in Last FY ($)(2)    Aggregate Withdrawals/ Distributions ($)    Aggregate Balance at Last FYE ($)(3)

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Aggregate earnings/(losses) in 2018 include (a) earnings/(losses) on the bookkeeping account maintained for the  applicable NEO under the NQ RSIP, credited at the same rates of return as those applicable to the investment fund(s) selected by the NEO under the RSIP; and (b) as applicable, dividend equivalents credited to the portion of each applicable  NEOs' bookkeeping account, if any, deemed to be invested in the Harsco Corporation Stock fund under the NQ RSIP. The investment options available under the NQ RSIP are substantially consistent with those available under the RSIP. Because there  were no preferential earnings/(losses) on deferred compensation during fiscal year 2018, none of the amounts reported in this column are reported as compensation for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Amounts reflect the value of the bookkeeping account maintained for each applicable NEO under the NQ RSIP, determined  based on the value of the investment fund(s) to which such account is deemed to be allocated. The following amounts are included in the fiscal year-end balance and, for NEOs that were included in the fiscal  2017 proxy disclosure, were previously reported in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table as compensation: Mr. Grasberger, $50,072; Mr. Minan, $20,209;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Mr. Hochman, $11,204; Ms. McKenzie, $10,902; and for Mr. Gill, no amounts were reported in the fiscal 2017. The year-end aggregate balance  for the NEOs as reported on the 2017 proxy disclosure, which are included in 2018 aggregate balance, were as follows: Mr. Grasberger, $169,252; Mr. Minan, $43,430; Mr. Hochman, $30,762; and Ms. McKenzie, $22,334; for  Mr. Gill, the calculated amount is $3,200.  
[END TABLE]
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
Retirement Savings and Investment Plan ("RSIP") 
Under the RSIP, we make matching contributions to the account of each participating employee equal to 100% of the employee's contributions up to the first 3% of compensation and 50% of the employee's contributions up to the next 2% of compensation. In addition, the RSIP provides for a discretionary contribution, as decided by the Company each year, to the account of each eligible employee who remains an active employee as of December 31 of such plan year. Under the NQ RSIP, we provide the matching and discretionary contributions, if any, that would otherwise be made under the qualified portion of the RSIP for salaried employees' contributions, but for Internal Revenue Code limitations under Section 402(g), Section 401(a)(17), Section 415 or Section 401(m). Company contributions to the NQ RSIP are made in the form of credits of non-qualified deferred compensation to bookkeeping accounts maintained as a record of the benefits to which employees are entitled. 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Pursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC issued the "Pay Ratio" disclosure rule under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K requiring companies to disclose the ratio of annual total compensation for their Principal Executive Officer to that of the employee identified as the Company's median compensated individual. 
We determined that the 2018 annual total compensation of the individual identified as the Company's median compensated individual (excluding the CEO) was $56,522, the annual total compensation of Mr. Grasberger was $5,737,547 and the ratio between the two was 102:1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
Methodology for Selecting the Median Employee 
The SEC pay ratio rules permit a company to use the same median employee identified in the first year of the required calculation for three years if there are no changes that would significantly affect the pay ratio disclosure. While our company acquired the Altek Group in 2018 (consisting of approximately 80 employees), this acquisition did not impact our employee population or compensation arrangements in any manner that would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. As such, the median employee used for 2018 is the same employee as identified in 2017, when we used the following methodology: 
We selected October 1, 2017 as our determination date and used foreign exchange rates effective on September 30, 2017. We applied the 5% "de minimis" allowance to exclude the following countries from our employee population totaling 4.7%: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Egypt: 368 employees or 3.8% of 9,615; and  
• Serbia: 88 employees or 0.9% of 9,615.  
[END TABLE]
The total population used for the "de minimus" exception prior to these exclusions is 9,615, with 2,091 being U.S. based employees, and 7,524 being non-U.S. employees. After applying the 5% "de minimis" exclusion, the total population is 9,159.  In selecting the median employee, we utilized a valid statistical sampling approach to identify a cluster of employees within 10% of the median, using a consistently applied compensation measure of annual base pay. To determine annual base pay for our hourly and our part-time employee population, we used reasonable assumptions to calculate the actual hours worked. From the cluster of employees at or near the median, we selected a median employee that best represented our overall employee population. 
Putting the Ratio in Context 
As discussed in the CD&A of this proxy, we target pay and benefits at competitive levels based on the job duties and location of the employee. It is our philosophy to offer total remuneration opportunities that actively support recruiting, motivating and retaining talented employees at all levels within our organization. 
Our workforce is global – we have employees located in 37 countries around the world. Our international employee footprint is driven by the needs of our clients, with the majority of our employees working at client sites outside of the United States. As such, when interpreting our CEO Pay Ratio results, it is important to keep in mind that pay practices vary by country based on client contract terms, local statutory requirements, cost of living and applicable local market competitive pay practices. 
Lastly, total compensation for our senior executives is comprised of a significant portion that varies based on financial and stock price performance of the Company. 82% of our CEO's total pay varies with performance while the majority of pay for our median employee (77%) is fixed base salary and overtime. The equity portion of the CEO's pay used in the CEO Pay Ratio calculation reflects his "opportunity" and the actual value of these awards will vary based on stock price and performance. 
Termination or Change in Control Arrangements 
We have entered into agreements with and maintain plans that will require us to provide compensation to certain of our NEOs in the event of a termination of employment, including as the result of a change in control. 
Set forth below are tables, one for each NEO who remained an officer as of December 31, 2018, showing our payment obligations following the potential termination of the officer's employment with us, including as the result of a change in control. The amounts disclosed below in each table are estimates only and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts that would be paid to the officers, which would only be known at the time that they become eligible for payment and, in the case of payments related to a change in control, would only be payable if a change in control were to occur. The tables reflect the amounts that would be payable under various arrangements assuming that the termination event occurred on December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive's full base salary and vacation pay accrued through the date of termination at the rate in effect on the  date of termination plus pro-rated annual incentive compensation through the date of termination at the same percentage rate applicable to the calendar year immediately prior to the year in which the date of  termination occurs, plus all other amounts to which the executive is entitled under any of our compensation plans, programs, practices or policies in effect at the time such payments are due;

 Proposal 3: Vote, on an Advisory Basis, to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and related SEC rules, and as required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our Board has adopted a policy of providing an annual stockholder vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
Response to Previous Say-on-Pay Votes 
Stockholders voted strongly in support of Harsco's executive compensation programs in 2018 with approximately 95% of votes cast in support of the program. We believe the continued support demonstrates that we are committed to attaining the highest levels of stockholder support for our executive compensation programs and that we respect input from our stockholders and take their concerns seriously. 
As described in detail under "Compensation Discussion & Analysis," our executive compensation program's primary objective is aligning our executives' pay with the interests of our stockholders. The program is also designed to reward short- and long-term financial, strategic and operational business results, while facilitating the Company's need to attract, motivate, develop and retain highly-qualified executives who are critical to our long-term success. 
We have many compensation practices that help ensure that our compensation programs are strongly aligned with our goals and strategies and promote good pay and corporate governance practices. These practices are discussed in detail under "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" and include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tie a significant amount of executive pay to Company performance;  
• Reward for business unit, corporate, and individual performance;  
• Maintain a clawback policy in the event of a material financial restatement;  
• Prohibit hedging and short sales;  
• Utilize an independent compensation advisor and review performance and independence annually;  
• Conduct an annual risk review and make program changes as necessary;  
• Require a "double trigger" for severance payments upon a change in control; and  
• Maintain substantial stock ownership guidelines and stock holding requirements for Directors and executive officers that  promote alignment of their interests with our stockholders' interests.  
[END TABLE]
Please read the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" section for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
We are asking our stockholders to support our NEO compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal gives you, as a stockholder, the opportunity to express your views on our NEOs' compensation. Your vote is not intended to address any specific item of our compensation program, but rather to address our overall approach to the compensation of our NEOs described in this Proxy Statement. Our MD&C Committee and our Board believe our overall program effectively implements our compensation philosophy and achieves our goals. Accordingly, we ask you to vote "FOR" the following resolution at our Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that Harsco Corporation's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to Harsco Corporation's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the Executive Compensation Tables and related narrative discussion." 
Required Vote: Our NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement will be approved if it receives more votes "FOR" than votes "AGAINST." Abstentions will have the effect of votes "AGAINST" with respect to this proposal and broker "non-votes" are not considered as votes cast with respect to this proposal and therefore will have no effect on the outcome.  This vote on NEO compensation is advisory, and therefore will not be binding on the Company, our MD&C Committee or our Board. However, our Board and MD&C Committee value our stockholders' opinions. If a significant percentage of our stockholders votes against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns, and the Human Resources Department and MD&C Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary or appropriate to address those concerns. Unless our Board modifies its policy of holding an advisory vote to approve executive compensation on an annual basis, the next advisory vote will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of our Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
Transactions with Related Persons 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were no transactions with the Company in which any related person had a direct or indirect material interest that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K, nor were any such transactions planned. 
Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
Our policies and procedures regarding related person transactions are set forth in writing in the Nominating Committee Charter and in our Code of Conduct. As set forth in its charter, the Nominating Committee is generally responsible for reviewing and approving all material transactions with any related person. Related persons include any of our Directors, Director nominees or executive officers and certain of our stockholders, and their immediate family members. Copies of the Nominating Committee's Charter and our Code of Conduct are available at the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.harsco.com/about-us. Approval of related person transactions by our full Board may also be warranted under certain circumstances (for example, to allow for approval of a related person transaction by a majority of disinterested Directors). 
To identify related person transactions, each year we submit and require our Directors and officers to complete Directors' and Officers' Questionnaires identifying any and all transactions with us in which the officer or Director (or their family members) has an interest. We review related person transactions due to the potential for a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, in any way with our interests. We expect our Directors, officers and employees to act and make decisions that are in our best interests and encourage them to avoid situations which could present a conflict between our interests and their own personal interests. 
Our Directors, officers and employees are prohibited from using their position of employment or other relationship with us to influence decisions concerning business transactions between us and a company in which they or a member of their immediate family has a personal interest through ownership, with the exception of investments in publicly-held corporations when the investment results in less than a one percent ownership interest. In addition, Directors, officers and employees must not accept personal favors or benefits from those dealing with us that could influence or could give the impression of influencing their business judgment. Our Code of Conduct, which applies to each of our Directors, officers and employees, sets forth our expectations regarding potential and actual conflicts of interest. The section of the Code of Conduct entitled "My Commitment to the Company" covers the concept of conflicts of interest and our view about when an inappropriate undertaking may be occurring.  Executive Development and Succession 
The executive development process ensures continuity of leadership over the long term, and it forms the basis on which we make ongoing executive assignments. Through the integration of the performance assessment and executive development processes, position assignments are made based on executives' qualifications and readiness for the position. Our future leaders are developed through these carefully selected assignments. We believe that consistent and ongoing application of this process meets the long-range requirements of the business and achieves competitive advantage. 
Each year, our MD&C Committee reviews our leadership talent development program to ensure good performance and alignment between business strategies and operating plans. The Board annually reviews the results of the leadership capability and succession process with the Chairman, President & CEO in executive session. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Earl, Longhi, Purvis and Widman served as members of our MD&C Committee during 2018. None of them served as one of our officers or employees or as an officer or employee of any of our subsidiaries during that time or in the past, and none of them or any other Director served as an executive officer of any entity for which any of our executive officers serve as a director or a member of its compensation committee. 
None of the members of our MD&C Committee has a relationship with us that is required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, Directors and more than 10% stockholders to file with the SEC and the NYSE Euronext reports of ownership and changes in ownership in their holdings of our stock. Copies of these reports also must be furnished to us. Based on an examination of these reports and information furnished by these stockholders, all such reports have been timely filed.  Other Matters 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
We and some brokers "household" the Letter from our Chairman & CEO, Annual Report on Form 10-K and other proxy materials, delivering a single copy of each to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, including the Letter from our Chairman & CEO and Annual Report on Form 10-K, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker, if your shares are held in a brokerage account, or us, if you hold registered shares, at which time we will promptly deliver separate copies of the materials to each of the affected stockholders or discontinue the practice, according to your wishes. You can notify us by sending a written request to Harsco Corporation, 350 Poplar Church Road, Camp Hill, PA 17011 or by calling (717) 763-7064. 
Stockholder Proposals and Nominations for Presentation at 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
The 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected to be held on April 21, 2020. If one of our stockholders wishes to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such proposal must be received at our executive offices no later than November 12, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and Proxy Card relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Although a stockholder proposal received after such date will not be entitled to inclusion in our Proxy Statement and Proxy Card, a stockholder can submit a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in accordance with our by-laws if written notice is mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120th and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement or notice of the date of such annual meeting is made or given to stockholders less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement was made or notice of the date of such meeting is mailed, whichever first occurs. 
In order to nominate a candidate for election as a Director at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder must provide written notice and supporting information to the Secretary of the Company by personal delivery or mail not later than January 22, 2020. If the stockholder does not also comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, the Company may exercise discretionary voting authority under proxies it solicits to vote in accordance with its best judgment on any such stockholder proposal.
