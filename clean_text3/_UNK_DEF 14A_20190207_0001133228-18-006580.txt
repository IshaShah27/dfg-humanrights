Dear fellow shareholder:
You are invited to attend your fund's annual shareholder meeting. The meeting will be held on Thursday, February 7, 2019,             at 2:00 P.M., Eastern time, at the offices of John Hancock Investments, 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.
Election of Trustees: your vote matters
As part of that meeting, you are being asked to vote on a proposal regarding the election of the Trustees who oversee the             funds in which you are a shareholder. Your fund's Trustees play an important oversight role, monitoring both performance and             fees on your behalf.
If you are not able to attend the meeting in person, I encourage you to vote today by proxy. The enclosed proxy statement             describes the proposal to elect five Trustees. Each of the nominees currently serves as a John Hancock fund Trustee, and three             of the five nominees are independent of John Hancock's management. Your proxy statement includes a brief description of each             nominee's background.

PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF TRUSTEES
General
Holders of the shares of each fund are entitled to elect five Trustees at this Meeting. Andrew G. Arnott, Marianne Harrison,             Deborah C. Jackson, James M. Oates, and Steven R. Pruchansky have been designated as subject to election by holders of the             shares of each fund.
Each fund has a "staggered" Board divided into three classes: two classes composed of five Trustees and one class composed             of four Trustees. The term of one class expires each year on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders or special meeting             in lieu thereof. Should a Trustee in a class wish to serve an additional term, he or she must stand for re-election. Classifying             the Trustees in this manner may prevent replacement of a majority of the Trustees for a period of up to two years. Four of             the nominees, Andrew G. Arnott, Deborah C. Jackson, James M. Oates and Steven R. Pruchansky, are members of the class of Trustees             standing for election this year. In addition, the Board has determined that it is in each fund's best interests that all current             Trustees have been elected to the Board by the fund's shareholders. Accordingly, the Board is proposing that each fund's shareholders             elect Marianne Harrison, who was appointed to the Board as of June 19, 2018, to serve as a Trustee. As noted below, Ms. Harrison             is a member of the class of Trustees whose terms will expire in 2021. As a result, Ms. Harrison is elected to serve as a Trustee             at this meeting, she will stand for election again in 2021.
As of the date of this proxy, each nominee for election currently serves as a Trustee of each fund and, if re-elected, will             serve for a term expiring on the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (or, for Ms. Harrison, the 2021 Annual Meeting             of Shareholders) or the special meeting in lieu thereof.
Using the enclosed proxy card, a shareholder may authorize the proxies to vote his or her shares for the nominees, or the             shareholder may withhold from the proxies authority to vote his or her shares for one or more of the nominees. If no contrary             instructions are given, the proxies will vote FOR the nominees. Each of the nominees has consented to his nomination and has             agreed to serve if elected. If, for any reason, any nominee should not be available for election or not be able to serve as             a Trustee, the proxies will exercise their voting power in favor of such substitute nominee, if any, as the funds' Trustees             may designate. The funds have no reason to believe that it will be necessary to designate any substitute nominees.
Proposal
For each fund, Andrew G. Arnott, Marianne Harrison, Deborah C. Jackson, James M. Oates and Steven R. Pruchansky are the current             nominees for election by the shareholders.
The vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares of a fund is sufficient to elect each nominee to serve as a Trustee             of that fund.
The Board recommends that shareholders of each fund vote "FOR" each of the five (5) nominees in the Proposal.  
Information About Nominees/Trustees
There are currently fourteen Trustees of each fund, eleven of whom are not "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment             Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) of the funds ("Independent Trustees"). Warren A. Thomson is retiring from             the Board effective as of December 31, 2018 and is not standing for re-election to the Board. The Board has approved the reduction             of the size of the Board from fourteen to thirteen Trustees, effective as of the date of Mr. Thomson's resignation. The following             table sets forth certain information regarding the current Trustees and the nominees for election to the Board. The table             also shows each current Trustee and each nominee's principal occupation or employment and other directorships during the past             five years and the number of John Hancock funds overseen by each of the current Trustees as of November 12, 2018. The business             address of each current Trustee and each nominee is 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.

With respect to Preferred Income, Preferred Income II and Preferred             Income III, the Board met five times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. With respect to Premium Dividend, Tax-Advantaged             Dividend and Tax-Advantaged Global, the Board met five times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. No Trustee attended             fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of Board meetings; and (2) the total number of meetings held by all             committees on which he or she served. The funds hold joint meetings of the Trustees and all committees. Two Trustees attended             the joint 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of the funds that was held on February 2, 2018.
The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee as Chairperson. The Chairperson presides at meetings of the Trustees, and may             call meetings of the Board and any Board committee whenever he deems it necessary. The Chairperson participates in the preparation             of the agenda for meetings of the Board and the identification of information to be presented to the Board with respect to             matters to be acted upon by the Board. The Chairperson also acts as a liaison with the funds' management, officers, attorneys,             and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Chairperson may perform such other functions as may be requested by the             Board from time to time. The Board has also designated a Vice Chairperson to serve in the absence of the Chairperson. Except             for any duties specified pursuant to each fund's Declaration of Trust or By-Laws, or as assigned by the Board, the designation             of a Trustee as Chairperson or Vice Chairperson does not impose on that Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that             are greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on any other Trustee, generally. The Board has designated a             number of standing committees as further described below, each of which has a Chairperson. The Board also may designate working             groups or ad hoc committees as it deems appropriate. 
The Board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent             judgment over matters under its purview, and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees or working groups of Trustees             and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board considers leadership by an Independent Trustee             as Chairperson to be integral to promoting effective independent oversight of the funds' operations and meaningful representation             of the shareholders' interests, given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the funds. The Board also believes             that having a super-majority of Independent Trustees is appropriate and in the best interest of the funds' shareholders. Nevertheless,             the Board also believes that having interested persons serve on the Board brings corporate and financial viewpoints that are,             in the Board's view, helpful elements in its decision-making process. In addition, the Board believes that Messrs. Arnott,             Boyle, Thomson and Ms. Harrison, as current or former senior executives of MFC, the parent company of the Advisor and of other             affiliates of the Advisor, provide the Board with the perspective of the Advisor in managing and sponsoring all of the funds.             The leadership structure of the Board may be changed, at any time and in the discretion of the Board, including in response             to changes in circumstances or the characteristics of each fund.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee; Compliance Committee; Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee; Nominating and Governance             Committee; and Investment Committee.
The current membership of each committee is set forth below.
Audit Committee. The Board has an Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended             (the "Exchange Act"), which comprises Independent Trustees (Messrs. Bardelis, Burgess and Hoffman) as defined under Section             2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. Burgess serves as Chairperson of this Committee. Each Audit Committee member is financially             literate, with at least one having accounting or financial management expertise. The Board has adopted a written charter for             the Committee. This Committee recommends to the full Board independent registered public accounting firms for each fund, oversees             the work of the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with each fund's audit, communicates with the             independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis and provides a forum for the independent registered public             accounting firm to report and discuss any matters it deems appropriate at any time. The Audit Committee held five meetings             during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, five meetings during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, and five meetings             during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for funds with the relevant fiscal year ends. The written report of the Audit             Committee is set forth below under "Audit Committee Report." The written charter of the Audit Committee is included as Attachment             1 to this proxy statement.
Compliance Committee. The Board also has a standing Compliance Committee (Mses. Fey and Jackson and Mr. Cunningham). This Committee reviews and             makes recommendations to the full Board regarding certain compliance matters relating to the funds. Ms. Fey serves as Chairperson             of this Committee. This Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, four meetings during             the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, and four meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for funds with the relevant             fiscal year ends.
Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee. The Board also has a standing Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee (Messrs. Boyle, Oates, Pruchansky and Russo). This Committee oversees the initiation, operation, and renewal of the various contracts between the funds and other entities. These             contracts include advisory and subadvisory agreements, custodial and transfer agency agreements and arrangements with other service providers. The Committee             also reviews the significant legal affairs of the funds, as well as any significant regulatory and legislative actions or proposals affecting or relating             to the funds or their service providers. The Committee also assists the Board in its oversight role with respect to the processes pursuant to which the Advisor and             the subadvisors identify, manage and report the various risks that affect or could affect the funds. Mr. Russo serves as Chairperson of this Committee. The             Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Table of Contents held four meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, four meetings during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018,             and four meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for funds with the relevant fiscal year ends. 
Nominating & Governance Committee. This Committee comprises all of the Independent Trustees as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. McClellan serves             as Chairperson of this Committee. The purpose of this Committee is to make determinations and recommendations to the Board             on issues related to the composition and operation of the Board and corporate governance matters applicable to the Independent             Trustees. This Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates.             This Committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, five meetings during the fiscal year ended             July 31, 2018, and five meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for funds with the relevant fiscal year ends.
Each fund's Board has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee. A copy of the Charter is included             as Attachment 2 to this proxy statement. This Committee will consider nominees recommended by fund shareholders. Any recommendations             from shareholders shall be directed to the Secretary of the relevant fund at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.             Any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange             Act in order to be considered by the Committee. In evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder, the Committee, in addition             to the criteria discussed below, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that nomination and whether             such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders.
The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited             to) the following criteria: (i) the nominee's reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards, and             such other personal characteristics as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others; (ii) the nominee's             business, professional, academic, financial, accounting or other experience and qualifications, which demonstrate that he             or she will make a valuable contribution as Trustee; (iii) a commitment to understand the funds and the responsibilities of             a trustee of an investment company; (iv) a commitment to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its             Committees; (v) the ability to understand potential conflicts of interest involving management of the funds and to act in             the interests of all shareholders; (vi) the absence of a real or apparent conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's             ability to represent the interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of an Independent Trustee;             and (vii) experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities. The Committee may determine             that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee             if the Committee finds that the criteria satisfied by the candidate and the candidate's other qualifications demonstrate the             appropriate level of fitness to serve. This Committee will strive to achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences             in respect of industries, professions and other experiences, and that is diversified as to gender and race.
As long as a current Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of this Committee, to satisfy these criteria, each fund             anticipates that the Committee would favor the re-nomination of a current Independent Trustee rather than a new candidate.             Consequently, while this Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as Independent Trustees, the             Committee may act upon such recommendations only if there is a vacancy on the Board or the Committee determines that the selection             of a new or additional Independent Trustee is in the best interests of a fund.
While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates,             the Committee may consider nominees recommended by any source, including shareholders, management, legal counsel and Board             members, as it deems appropriate. All recommendations shall include all information relating to such person that is required             to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of Board members and as specified in the relevant fund's By-Laws,             and must be accompanied by a written consent of the proposed candidate to stand for election if nominated for the Board and             to serve if elected by shareholders. The Committee's process for identifying and evaluating nominees to serve as Independent             Trustees of the funds is set forth in Annex A to the Committee's Charter.
Investment Committee. The Board also has an Investment Committee composed of all of the Trustees. The Investment Committee has five subcommittees             with the Trustees divided among the five subcommittees (each an "Investment Sub-Committee"). Each Investment Sub-Committee             reviews investment matters relating to a particular group of funds and coordinates with the full Board regarding investment             matters. Ms. Jackson and Messrs. Bardelis, Cunningham, Hoffman and Oates serve as Chairpersons of the Investment Sub-Committees.             The Investment Sub-Committee that oversees the funds held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, five             meetings during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, and five meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for             the funds with the relevant fiscal year ends.
Annually, the Board evaluates its performance and that of its Committees, including the effectiveness of the Board's Committee             structure.
Risk Oversight
As registered investment companies, the funds are subject to a variety of risks, including investment risks (such as, among others, market risk, credit risk and interest             rate risk), financial risks (such as, among others, settlement risk, liquidity risk and valuation risk), compliance risks,             and operational risks. As a part of its overall activities, the Board oversees the funds' risk management activities that are implemented by the Advisor, the funds' CCO and other service providers to the funds. The Advisor has primary responsibility for the funds' risk management on a day-to-day basis as a part of its overall responsibilities. The funds' subadvisors, subject to oversight of the Advisor, are primarily responsible for managing investment and financial risks as             a part of their day-to-day investment responsibilities, as well as operational and compliance risks at their firms. The Advisor             and the CCO also assist the Board in overseeing compliance with investment policies of the funds and regulatory requirements and monitor the implementation of the various compliance policies and procedures approved by             the Board as a part of its oversight responsibilities.
The Advisor identifies to the Board the risks that it believes may affect the funds and develops processes and controls regarding             such risks. However, risk management is a complex and dynamic undertaking and it is not always possible to comprehensively identify and/or mitigate             all such risks at all times since risks are at times impacted by external events. In discharging its oversight responsibilities, the Board considers risk management             issues throughout the year 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Table of Contents with the assistance of its various Committees as described below. Each Committee meets at least quarterly and presents reports             to the Board, which may prompt further discussion of issues concerning the oversight of the funds' risk management. The Board as a whole also reviews             written reports or presentations on a variety of risk issues as needed and may discuss particular risks that are not addressed in the Committee             process. 
The Board has established an Investment Committee, which consists of five Investment Sub-Committees. Each Investment Sub-Committee             assists the Board in overseeing the significant investment policies of the relevant funds and the performance of their subadvisors. The Advisor monitors these policies and subadvisor activities and may recommend             changes in connection with the funds to each relevant Investment Sub-Committee in response to subadvisor requests or other circumstances. On at least a quarterly             basis, each Investment Sub-Committee reviews reports from the Advisor regarding the relevant funds' investment performance, which include information about investment and financial risks and how they are managed, and from             the CCO or his/her designee regarding subadvisor compliance matters. In addition, each Investment Sub-Committee meets periodically             with the portfolio managers of the funds' subadvisors to receive reports regarding management of the funds, including with respect to risk management processes.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing with the independent auditors, at various times throughout the year, matters             relating to the funds' financial reporting. In addition, this Committee oversees the process of each fund's valuation of its portfolio securities, assisted by the funds' Pricing Committee (composed of officers of the Trusts), which calculates fair value determinations pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board.
The Compliance Committee assists the Board in overseeing the activities of the Trusts' CCO with respect to the compliance programs of the funds, the Advisor, the subadvisors, and certain of the funds' other service providers (the Distributor and Transfer Agent). This Committee and the Board receive and consider periodic             reports from the CCO throughout the year, including the CCO's annual written report, which, among other things, summarizes             material compliance issues that arose during the previous year and any remedial action taken to address these issues, as well             as any material changes to the compliance programs.
The Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight role with respect to the processes pursuant to which             the Advisor and the subadvisors identify, assess, manage and report the various risks that affect or could affect the funds. This Committee reviews reports from the funds' Advisor on a periodic basis regarding the risks facing the funds, and makes recommendations to the Board concerning risks and risk oversight matters as the Committee deems appropriate. This             Committee also coordinates with the other Board Committees regarding risks relevant to the other Committees, as appropriate.
In addressing issues regarding the funds' risk management between meetings, appropriate representatives of the Advisor communicate with the Chairperson of the Board,             the relevant Committee Chair, or the Trusts' CCO, who is directly accountable to the Board. As appropriate, the Chairperson of the Board, the Committee Chairs and the             Trustees confer among themselves, with the Trusts' CCO, the Advisor, other service providers, external fund counsel, and counsel to the Independent Trustees, to identify and             review risk management issues that may be placed on the full Board's agenda and/or that of an appropriate Committee for review             and discussion.
In addition, in its annual review of the funds' advisory, subadvisory and distribution agreements, the Board reviews information provided by the Advisor, the subadvisors             and the Distributor relating to their operational capabilities, financial condition, risk management processes and resources.
The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts its risk oversight role.
The Advisor also has its own, independent interest in risk management. In this regard, the Advisor has appointed a Risk and             Investment Operations Committee, consisting of senior personnel from each of the Advisor's functional departments. This Committee             reports periodically to the Board and the Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee on risk management matters. The Advisor's risk             management program is part of the overall risk management program of John Hancock, the Advisor's parent company. John Hancock's             Chief Risk Officer supports the Advisor's risk management program, and at the Board's request will report on risk management             matters.

1 Trustee share ownership is provided as of October 31, 2018. The amounts reflect the aggregate dollar range of equity securities             beneficially owned by the Trustees in the funds and in all John Hancock funds overseen by each Trustee. The information as             to beneficial ownership is based on statements furnished to the funds by the Trustees. Each of the Trustees has all voting             and investment powers with respect to the shares indicated.
2 Retiring from the Board effective as of December 31, 2018. Not standing for re-election.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires a fund's executive officers, Trustees and persons who own more than 10% of a fund's             shares ("10% Shareholders") to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission             ("SEC"). Executive officers, Trustees and 10% Shareholders are also required by SEC regulations to furnish each fund with             copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of these reports furnished to the funds             and representations that no other reports were required to be filed, each fund believes that, during the past fiscal year,             its executive officers, Trustees and 10% Shareholders complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.
Trustee Compensation
Each fund pays fees to its Independent Trustees. Trustees are also reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses.             Each Independent Trustee receives in the aggregate from each fund and the other closed-end funds in the John Hancock Fund             Complex an annual retainer of $40,000.
The following table provides information regarding the compensation paid by each fund and the other investment companies in             the John Hancock Fund Complex to the Independent Trustees for their services for each fund's most recently completed fiscal             year.

The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or incorporated by reference             in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we             specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the funds' management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") the audited             financial statements of the funds contained in the Annual Reports on Form N-CSR for the most recent fiscal year.* The Audit Committee also has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Public Company Accounting             Oversight Board Auditing Standards, AU Section 380, which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the             audit of the funds' financial statements.
The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements             of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence             and has discussed with PwC its independence from the funds.
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]

Based on the review and discussions referred to above the Audit Committee, pursuant to the authority delegated to the Audit             Committee by the Board of Trustees, approved the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the fund's Annual Report             on Form N-CSR for filing with the SEC.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Trustees of each fund, including a majority of each fund's Independent Trustees, have selected PwC, 101 Seaport Boulevard,             Suite 500, Boston, MA 02210, to act as independent registered public accounting firm.
Representatives of PwC are not expected to be present at the meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement,             if they desire to do so, and will be available should any matter arise requiring their participation.
The following tables set forth the aggregate fees billed by PwC for the funds' two most recently completed fiscal years for             professional services rendered for (i) the audit of the funds' annual financial statements and the review of financial statements             included in the funds' reports to shareholders, (ii) assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance             of the audit or review of the funds' financial statements, (iii) tax compliance, tax advice or tax planning and (iv) all other             services provided by PwC other than (i), (ii) and (iii).

Each fund's Audit Committee has adopted procedures that require the pre-approval of audit and nonaudit services provided by             the fund's independent registered public accounting firm to the fund, the Advisor and any entity controlling, controlled by             or under common control with the Advisor that provide services to each fund (the "Advisor Affiliates") and that relate directly             to each fund's operations and financial reporting. In addition, these procedures identify certain types of audit and non-audit             services that are anticipated to be provided by PwC during a calendar year and, provided the services are within the scope             and value standards set forth in the procedures, such services are deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The scope             and value criteria are reviewed annually. Unless a service is pre-approved under the procedures, it must be specifically pre-approved             by the Audit Committee.
In recommending PwC as the funds' independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has considered the compensation             paid to PwC for audit and non-audit services to the Advisor and the Advisor Affiliates, and has determined that such compensation             is not incompatible with maintaining PwC's independence.

Required Vote for Proposal 1
Approval of Proposal 1 will require a plurality of all votes cast, assuming a quorum exists. A "plurality" means that the five             Nominees presented for election receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected as Trustees, regardless of the number             of votes cast.
The Board of Trustees, including all the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" Proposal 1.
MISCELLANEOUS
Voting Procedures
Directions to attend the Meeting where shareholders may vote in person can be found on our website at www.jhinvestments.com/proxy.             Valid photo identification may be required to attend the Meeting in person. All valid proxies will be voted in accordance with specifications thereon, or in the absence of specifications, for each Nominee                in the proposal. The proposal described in this proxy statement is considered a routine matter on which brokers holding shares in "street             name" may vote on this proposal without instruction under the rules of the NYSE.
Revocation of Proxies. Proxies may be revoked at any time before the Meeting either (i) by a written revocation received by the Secretary of the             funds, (ii) by a properly executed later-dated proxy received by the Secretary of the funds, or (iii) by an in-person vote             at the Meeting. Attendance at the Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a proxy. Shareholders may revoke a proxy as often             as they wish before the Meeting. Only the latest dated, properly executed proxy card received prior to or at the Meeting will             be counted.
Quorum. Shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment             of the Meeting. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund at the close of business on that date present             in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the Meeting.
Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each share held and fractional votes for fractional shares held. No shares have             cumulative voting rights.
In the event the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve a proposal is not obtained at the Meeting,             the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting with respect to any proposal in accordance             with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any adjournment of the Meeting will require the affirmative             vote of the holders of a majority of the fund's shares cast at the Meeting, and any adjournment with respect to any proposal             will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the proposal cast at the             Meeting. The persons named as proxies will vote for or against any adjournment in their discretion.

Table of Contents
Abstentions and Broker "Non-Votes." Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received             from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee indicates on the proxy that it does             not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) are counted as shares entitled to vote at the Meeting in determining             whether a quorum is present, but do not count as votes cast for a proposal. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes have             the same effect as a vote "against" a proposal.
Cost of Preparation and Distribution of Proxy Materials. The costs of the preparation of these proxy materials and their distribution will be borne by the funds.
Solicitation of Proxies. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, proxies may be solicited by telephone, by fax, by e-mail or in person             by the Trustees, officers and employees of the funds and/or by personnel of the Advisor, its affiliates, or by broker-dealer             firms. Computershare Inc., which serves as transfer agent, will assist in the solicitation of proxies. Computershare Inc.             will be reimbursed by the funds for its reasonable expenses.
Telephone Voting
In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, by fax, by e-mail or in person, the funds may also arrange to have votes recorded             by telephone by officers and employees of the funds or by the personnel of the Advisor, the transfer agent or solicitor. The             telephone voting procedure is designed to verify a shareholder's identity, to allow a shareholder to authorize the voting             of shares in accordance with the shareholder's instructions and to confirm that the voting instructions have been properly             recorded.
A shareholder will be called on a recorded line at the telephone number in each fund's account records and will be asked to             provide certain identifying information.
The shareholder will then be given an opportunity to authorize proxies to vote his or her shares at the Meeting in accordance             with the shareholder's instructions.
Alternatively, a shareholder may call the funds' Voice Response Unit to vote by taking the following steps:
Read the Proxy Statement and have your proxy card(s) at hand.
Call the toll-free-number located on your proxy card(s).
Enter the "control number" found on the front of your proxy card(s).
Follow recorded instructions to cast your vote.
With both methods of telephone voting, to ensure that the shareholder's instructions have been recorded correctly, the shareholder             will also receive a confirmation of the voting instructions. If the shareholder decides after voting by telephone to attend             the Meeting, the shareholder can revoke the proxy at that time and vote the shares at the Meeting.
Internet Voting
Shareholders also will have the opportunity to submit their voting instructions via the Internet by utilizing a program provided             through a third-party vendor. Voting via the Internet will not affect a shareholder's right to vote in person if the shareholder             decides to attend the Meeting. A shareholder should not mail the proxy card(s) if he or she is voting via the Internet. To             vote via the Internet, a shareholder will need the "control number" that appears on the proxy  card(s). These Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identities, to allow shareholders to give             their voting instructions and to confirm that shareholders' instructions have been recorded properly. If a shareholder is             voting via the Internet, he or she should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage             charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, the costs of which the shareholder must bear.
To vote via the Internet, a shareholder should:
Read the Proxy Statement and have your proxy card(s) at hand.
Go to the Web site on the proxy card(s).
Enter the "control number" found on the front of your proxy card(s).
Follow the instructions on the Web site.
To ensure that the shareholder's instructions have been recorded correctly, the shareholder will receive a confirmation of             his or her voting instructions immediately after submitting them.
Shareholders Sharing the Same Address
As permitted by law, only one copy of this Proxy Statement may be delivered to shareholders residing at the same address,             unless such shareholders have notified the applicable fund of their desire to receive multiple copies of the shareholder reports             and other materials that a fund sends. If a shareholder would like to receive an additional copy, he or she should contact             the applicable fund by writing to 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, Attn: Michael Heffernan, or by calling             866-859-8682. The fund will then promptly deliver, upon request, a separate copy of this Proxy Statement to any shareholder             residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Shareholders wishing to receive separate copies of the fund's shareholder             reports and other materials in the future, and shareholders sharing an address that wish to receive a single copy if they             are receiving multiple copies, also should send a request as indicated.

If any other matters properly come before the Meeting, the shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with             the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Shareholder proposals, including Nominees for Trustee, intended to be presented at a fund's 2020 annual meeting, in accordance             with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, must be received by that fund at its offices at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts             02116, by no later than the close of business on August 8, 2019, for inclusion in that fund's proxy statement and form of             proxy relating to that meeting (subject to certain exceptions). Written notice of a shareholder proposal submitted outside             of the processes of Rule 14a-8 must be delivered to the Secretary of the relevant fund at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts             02116 by no later than the close of business on September 7, 2019, and no earlier than August 8, 2019. In order to be included             in a fund's proxy statement and form of proxy, a shareholder proposal must comply with all applicable legal requirements.             Timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee that such proposal will be included.

ATTACHMENT 1
JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
A. Overall Role and Responsibility
1. Overall Role. The Audit Committee (the "Committee") shall assist the Board of Trustees (collectively, the "Board") of each             registered investment company in the John Hancock Funds complex (collectively, the "Trust") in its oversight role with respect             to:  a. the integrity of the Trust's financial statements;  b. the financial reporting process;  c. the system of internal controls over financial reporting;  d. the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm's (the "Independent Auditor") qualifications and independence;  e. the performance of the Trusts' Independent Auditor;  f. the Trusts' compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to accounting, internal accounting controls or             auditing matters and related     disclosures; and  g. valuation of securities.
2. Responsibility of the Committee. The function of the Committee is oversight. Officers of the Trust are responsible for financial reporting and maintaining             appropriate systems for accounting and internal control over financial reporting. The Trust's Independent Auditor is responsible             for planning and carrying out an audit in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements and the standards of the PCAOB             or other similar accounting and auditing standards organization and for providing other audit and non-audit services for which             it may be engaged by the Trust.
In fulfilling the Committee's responsibilities hereunder, it is recognized that it is not the duty or responsibility of the             Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set             auditor independence standards. Accordingly, the Committee's oversight role does not provide any expert or special assurance             as to the financial statements and other financial information provided by the Trust to its shareholders and others. The authority             and responsibilities set forth in this Charter recognize that the Committee members are not acting as accountants or auditors,             and this Charter does not reflect or create any duty or obligation of the Committee to plan or conduct any audit, to determine             or certify that the Trust's financial statements are complete, accurate, fairly presented, or in accordance with generally             accepted accounting principles or applicable law, or to guarantee the Independent Auditor's report.
Reliance on Other Persons and Information. Each Committee member shall be entitled to rely on: (i) the integrity of those persons and organizations within and outside             the Trust from which the Committee receives information; (ii) the accuracy of the financial and other information provided             to the Committee by such persons and organizations, absent actual knowledge to the contrary (which shall be promptly reported             to the Board); and (iii) statements made by the officers and employees of the Trust, the Trust's investment adviser (the "Adviser"),             or other third parties as to any information technology, internal audit and other non-audit services provided by the Independent             Auditor to the Trust. In addition, the evaluation of the Trust's financial statements by the Committee is not of the same             scope as, and does not involve the extent of detail as, audits performed by the Independent Auditor, nor does the Committee's             evaluation substitute for the responsibilities of the Trust's officers for preparing, or the Independent Auditor for auditing,             the financial statements.
B. Membership
1. Number of Committee Members. The Committee shall consist of at least three Trustees of the Trust, none of whom is an "interested person" (as defined             in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Trust (an "Independent Trustee").  2. Appointment of Committee Members. The full Board shall designate the members of the Committee and the Committee Chair. Committee members shall serve at the             pleasure of the Board.  3. Qualifications of Committee Members.  a. Except as otherwise permitted by the applicable rules of the NYSE Arca, each member of the Committee shall be "independent,"             as defined by such rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  b. No Committee member may receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Trust,             other than fees paid in his or her capacity as a member or Chair of the Board, or of any committee of the Board.

Unless otherwise permitted by the Board, no member of the Committee may serve on the audit committee of more than two             other public companies (other than another John Hancock fund).
4. Audit Committee Financial Expert. The Board shall determine whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item             3 of Form N-CSR. The designation of a person as an "audit committee financial expert," within the meaning of the rules under             Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on that person than             the responsibility and liability imposed on such person as a Committee member, nor shall it decrease the duties and obligations             of other Committee members or the Board. The Board shall make a redetermination should the composition of the Committee change.
C. Operations
1. Meetings and Actions by Written Consent. The Committee shall meet as often as it deems appropriate. Meetings may be called and notice given by the Committee Chair             or a majority of the Committee members. Committee members may attend meetings in person or by telephone. The Committee may             act by written consent to the extent permitted by law and the Trust's governing documents.

2. Delegation to Subcommittees. The Committee may delegate any portion of its authority, including the authority to grant preapprovals of audit and permitted             non-audit services, to a subcommittee of one or more members.
3. Appointment of Chair. As noted above, one member of the Committee shall be appointed as Chair by the Board. The Chair shall be responsible for             leadership of the Committee, including scheduling meetings or reviewing and approving the schedule for them, preparing agendas             or reviewing and approving them before the meetings, presiding over the meetings, and making reports to the Board, as appropriate.
4. Executive Sessions. The Committee and counsel for the Independent Trustees may meet privately and may admit non-members by invitation. The Committee             shall meet with Officers of the Trust and the Independent Auditor in separate executive sessions as the Committee deems appropriate,             and may meet with internal legal counsel and compliance personnel of the Adviser and with representatives of the Trust's service             providers, to discuss matters that relate to the areas for which the Committee has responsibility.
5. Required Vote and Quorum. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Committee participating in any meeting of the Committee is necessary             for the adoption of any resolution. No resolution may be adopted unless at least 50% of the Committee members are present             at the meeting in person or by telephone.
6. Appropriate Resources and Authority. The Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the authority             to retain special counsel and other advisers, experts or consultants, at the Trust's expense, as it determines necessary or             appropriate to carry out its duties. The Committee shall have direct access to such officers of, and service providers to,             the Trust, including subadvisers to the Trusts, as it deems desirable.
7. Review of Charter. The Committee shall review and assess the adequacy of this Charter at least annually and, when necessary, will recommend             changes to the Board for its approval. The Board may amend this Charter at any time in response to recommendations from the             Committee or on its own motion.
8. Performance Evaluation. The Committee shall undertake and review with the Board an annual performance evaluation of the Committee. The performance             evaluation by the Committee shall be conducted in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate. The report to the Board             may take the form of an oral report by the Committee Chair or by any other member of the Committee or by counsel to the Independent             Trustees if designated by the Committee to make this report.

aa. Consider whether the type and/or annual total monetary amount of non-audit services provided by the Trust's Independent             Auditor to the Adviser or any Adviser Affiliate that provides ongoing services to the Trust, are inconsistent with maintaining             the independence of the Independent Auditor.

The Committee is not the primary body responsible for oversight of risk assessment and risk management, which is primarily             the role of the Contract, Legal and Risk Committee.
c. Prepare an annual Committee report for inclusion when necessary in a Closed-End Fund's proxy statement relating to its             annual meeting of security holders, or in any other filing required by the SEC's rules.
d. Discuss generally the types of information to be disclosed in press releases concerning dividends, as well as financial             information provided to analysts and rating agencies (if any), and the type of presentations to be made.
e. Each Committee member will have the qualifications set forth in B.3. above.
f. Discuss with Officers of the Trust any notice to an exchange of a violation of the exchanges' corporate governance listing             standards.
E. Complaints
The Committee shall follow the procedures below for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints or concerns regarding             accounting, internal accounting controls, and auditing matters relating to the Trust ("Complaints").
The Committee will request the Adviser to establish procedures that are acceptable to the Chief Compliance Officer of the             Trust (the "CCO") for the anonymous submission of Complaints by employees of the Adviser and its affiliates. Complaints by             other parties may be submitted to the Committee Chair or to the CCO, who will then forward the Complaint to the Committee             Chair. The CCO will provide a report to the Committee each quarter regarding Complaints received during the prior quarter.
The Committee Chair may convene a special meeting of the Committee (which may be telephonic) to review a Complaint or may             defer review until the next regularly scheduled quarterly Committee meeting. The Committee will evaluate the Complaint, determine             the appropriate action to be taken in response to the Complaint, and review any action taken by the Adviser and its affiliates             to address the Complaint. In evaluating the Complaint, the Committee may conduct an investigation or request another party,             including outside legal counsel or other persons not affiliated with the Adviser, to conduct an investigation of the Complaint.
The Committee shall report to the full Board its responses to all Complaints and any actions taken to address the Complaints.
Except as necessary to carry out its duties under this section, the Committee will seek to keep all Complaints and the identity             of the party submitting the Complaint confidential to the extent reasonably possible.
F. Review of Other Matters a. Review with the full Board any issues that arise with respect to the quality or integrity of the Trust's financial statements             and the performance and independence of the independent auditors.
b. In coordination with the Trust's Compliance Committee, review and report to the Board on the Trust's compliance with legal             and reporting requirements. The Compliance Committee has primary responsibility for these requirements except for those that             relate directly to accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing matters and financial reporting. To the extent these             responsibilities are delegated to another committee of the Board, the Committee will coordinate the review and reporting with             this committee.
c. In coordination with the Trust's Contracts, Legal and Risk Committee, review and report to the Board on the Trust's significant             risks and exposure of the Trust to deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting. The Contract, Legal and Risk Committee has primary responsibility             for these requirements

ANNEX A
The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited             to) the criteria set forth below. The Committee may determine that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one             or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Committee finds that the criteria satisfied by the             candidate and the candidate's other qualifications demonstrate the appropriate level of fitness to serve.
General Criteria
1. Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards, and such other personal             characteristics as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others.  2. Nominees should have business, professional, academic, financial, accounting or other experience and qualifications which             demonstrate that they will make a valuable contribution as Trustees.  3. Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Funds, and the responsibilities of a trustee/director of an investment             company and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees.  4. Nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the             Funds, including shareholders and the investment adviser, and to act in the interests of all shareholders.  5. Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair their ability to represent the             interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a trustee.  6. Nominees should have experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities.
It is the intent of the Committee that at least one Independent Trustee be an "audit committee financial expert" as that term             is defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR.
Application of Criteria to Current Trustees
The re-nomination of current Trustees should not be viewed as automatic, but should be based on continuing qualification under             the criteria set forth above based on, among other things, the current Trustee's contribution to the Board and any committee             on which he or she serves.
Review of Nominations
1. The Committee believes that it is in the best interests of each Trust and its shareholders to obtain highly-qualified candidates             to serve as members of the Board.
2. In nominating candidates who would be Independent Trustees, the Committee believes that no particular qualities or skills             nor any specific minimum qualifications or disqualifications are controlling or paramount. The Committee shall take into consideration             any such factors as it deems appropriate; however, the appropriate mix of skills, expertise and attributes needed to maintain             an effective board are sought in the applicant pool as part of every search the Board undertakes for new trustees, including             but not limited to the diversity of thought, as well as of gender, race, ethnic background and geographic origin. These factors             may also include (but are not limited to) the person's character, integrity, judgment, skill and experience with investment             companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size and subject to similar legal restrictions and             oversight; the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board members; and the extent to which             the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any Committees thereof. Other factors that the Committee may             take into consideration include a person's availability and commitment to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities;             whether or not the person has or had any relationships that might impair or appear to impair his or her independence, such             as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund management, the investment adviser and/or any subadviser of the             Funds, as applicable, Fund service providers, or their affiliates or with Fund shareholders. The Committee will strive to             achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences in respect of industries, professions and other experiences, and             that is diversified as to thought, gender, race, ethnic background and geographic origin.
3. While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates,             the Committee may consider nominees recommended by any source, including shareholders, management, legal counsel and Board             members, as it deems appropriate. The Committee may retain a professional search firm or a consultant to assist the Committee             in a search for a qualified candidate. Any recommendations from shareholders shall be directed to the Secretary of the relevant             Trust at such address as is set forth in the Trust's disclosure documents. Recommendations from management may be submitted             to the Committee Chair. All recommendations shall include all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed             in solicitations of proxies for the election of Board members and as specified in the relevant Trust's By-Laws, and must be             accompanied by a written consent of the proposed candidate to stand for election if nominated for the Board and to serve if             elected by shareholders.
4. Any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the             Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to be considered by the Committee. In evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder,             the Committee, in addition to the criteria discussed above, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that             nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders. If the Board determines to include             a shareholder's candidate among the slate of its designated nominees, the candidate's name will be placed on the Trust's proxy             card. If the Board determines not to include such candidate among its designated nominees, and the shareholder has satisfied             the requirements of Rule 14a-8, the shareholder's candidate will be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who originally             nominated the candidate. In that case, the candidate will not be named on the proxy card distributed with the Trust's proxy             statement.
5. As long as a current Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of the Committee, to satisfy the criteria listed above,             the Committee generally would favor the re-nomination of a current Trustee rather than a new candidate. Consequently, while the Committee will consider             nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as trustees, the Committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the Board,             or the Committee determines 
[BEGIN TABLE] [END TABLE]
Table of Contents that the selection of a new or additional Trustee is in the best interests of the relevant Trust. In the event that a vacancy             arises or a change in Board membership is determined to be advisable, the Committee will, in addition to any shareholder recommendations, consider candidates             identified by other means as discussed in this Annex A. 
6. With respect to candidates for Independent Trustee, a biography of each candidate shall be acquired and shall be reviewed             by counsel to the Independent Trustees and counsel to the Trust to determine the candidate's eligibility to serve as an Independent             Trustee.
7. The Committee may from time to time establish specific requirements and/or additional factors to be considered for Independent             Trustee candidates as it deems necessary or appropriate.
8. After its consideration of relevant factors, the Committee shall present its recommendation(s) to the full Board for its             consideration.
