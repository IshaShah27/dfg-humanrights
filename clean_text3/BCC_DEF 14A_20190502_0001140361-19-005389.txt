Fellow Shareholders:
You are cordially invited to join us for our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, which will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019, at 9:30 a.m. Mountain Time, in Meeting Place 1 at the     Hyatt Place Boise, 1024 W Bannock St., Boise, ID 83702. The Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the Proxy Statement that follow describe the business to be conducted at the meeting.
As we look forward to our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, it is worth reflecting on the year just completed.  In 2018, our full year financial results, excluding facility sale and     closure changes, were at the highest levels we have delivered since our IPO in 2013, and, despite the largest drop in commodity pricing in 20 years, both businesses were well-managed and worked diligently to minimize the impact.  Additionally, we took     several actions (discussed in more detail on page 2) to lower costs and increase our strategic focus in manufacturing and to accelerate growth in distribution.  
As a reflection of our progress toward executing our long-term strategy, and as a way to return capital to you – our shareholders – we returned $55 million to our shareholders in 2018     through our quarterly dividend, an additional one-dollar-per-share dividend, and share repurchases. It is our intention to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders when we have not identified suitable growth opportunities for the     businesses. We believe that our continued execution on our long-term growth plan will help ensure that our shareholders reap the benefits of our strategy and investments in the years to come.
Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, your vote is important and we encourage you to vote your shares promptly. If you will note vote your shares at the meeting, you may     vote your shares using a toll-free telephone number or the Internet. If you received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, you may sign, date, and mail the proxy card in the envelope provided.

Voting Matters
Director Nominees
Our board of directors consists of three staggered classes of directors, designated as Class I, Class II, and Class III. The three members of Class III, Steven C. Cooper, Karen E.       Gowland, and David H. Hannah, are standing for election as directors at the annual meeting, to hold office for three-year terms expiring in 2022.

Cooper and Hannah and Ms. Gowland were directors for the entire year and attended 100% of the board and committee meetings on which they served. Our board of directors recommends a FOR vote for each director nominee because it       believes each is qualified to serve as a director and has made and will continue to make positive contributions to the board.

2018 Business Highlights
Executive Compensation Highlights
We provide highlights of our executive compensation program below. It is important to review the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A) and compensation tables in this       proxy statement for a complete understanding of our compensation program and philosophy. (Page 22)
Say on Pay
For the five years following our initial public offering in February 2013, our shareholders have shown strong support of our executive compensation program, with       vote results of 99.6%, 98.5%, 98.1%, 99.4%, and 97.4% from 2014 to 2018, respectively. Our compensation committee continues to examine our executive compensation program to ensure alignment between our executives and the long-term interests of our       shareholders.
We ask that our shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as further described in proposal 2. (Page 8)

PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON
Proposal No. 1 - Election of Three Class III Directors
Our board of directors consists of three staggered classes of directors, designated as Class I, Class II, and Class III. The director members of, and the term expiration dates for, each     class are:
At each succeeding annual shareholders' meeting, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting will be elected for a three-year term. Each director will     hold office for the term to which he or she is elected and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, disqualification, resignation, or removal.
Director Nominees
Three nominees, Ms. Gowland and Messrs. Hannah and Cooper, are standing for election as directors at the annual meeting to hold office for a three-year term expiring in 2022.
Shares will be voted according to shareholder instructions. If no voting instructions are provided, a broker may not vote on the matter. For 2019, our director nominees are running     unopposed. Therefore, to be elected to our board of directors in 2019, each director nominee must receive an affirmative vote of the majority of the votes of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting of the stockholders and entitled to     vote.
The three director nominees have confirmed their availability for election. If any of the director nominees becomes unavailable to serve as a director for any reason prior to the annual     meeting, our board of directors may substitute another person as a director nominee. In that case, if a shareholder has voted for the original nominee, those shares will be voted FOR the substitute director nominee.
Additional information follows for the three director nominees and the directors continuing in office, particularly concerning their business experience and qualifications, as well as     attributes and skills that led our board to conclude that such person should serve as a director of the Company.

[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to cast a nonbinding advisory vote regarding the     compensation of our named executive officers. Our compensation philosophy is designed to emphasize a focus on total compensation, with a large portion of our named executive officers' pay being performance-based and considered variable, "at risk," and     aligned with shareholder interests. We seek to pay for performance so that we can recruit and retain the talented employees necessary to drive superior financial and operational results. We view our compensation program as a strategic tool that     supports the successful execution of our business strategy and reinforces a performance-based culture. Our board of directors has agreed to hold this nonbinding advisory vote on an annual basis, with the next vote expected to occur at the 2020 annual     meeting of shareholders.
Shareholders are urged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in this proxy statement, which discusses how our compensation policies and procedures implement     our compensation philosophy. The compensation committee and our board of directors believe these policies and procedures are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving its goals. Our board of directors has determined the     best way to allow shareholders to vote on our executive compensation is through the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and     narrative discussion in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED.
Your vote is important to us. Although this advisory vote is nonbinding, the compensation committee and our board of directors will review the results of the vote. The     compensation committee will consider our shareholders' preferences and take them into account in making future determinations concerning our executive compensation.
Proposal No. 3 - Ratification of Independent Accountant for the Year Ending December 31, 2019
The audit committee of our board of directors is responsible for the engagement of our independent auditor and has appointed KPMG LLP (KPMG) in that capacity, effective February 21,     2019.
Although ratification is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, our board of directors is submitting the selection of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification because we value our     shareholders' views on our independent registered public accounting firm. If the appointment of KPMG is not ratified, the audit committee will evaluate the basis for the shareholders' vote when determining whether to continue the firm's engagement, but     may ultimately determine to continue the engagement of the firm or another audit firm without resubmitting the matter to shareholders. Even if the selection of KPMG is ratified, the audit committee may, in its sole discretion, change the appointment at     any time during the year if it determines a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
It is expected that one or more representatives of KPMG will be present at our annual meeting to answer questions. They will also have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire     to do so.
For information on the services KPMG has provided for us in 2018, please refer to the audit committee report at page 20.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Code of Ethics for Our Board of Directors
In 2018, we revised the Boise Cascade Company Code of Ethics (Code of Ethics) that applies to our directors and all of our employees to make it easier to read and provide more     explanation and examples. We have a toll-free reporting service available that permits employees to confidentially report violations of our Code of Ethics or other issues of significant concern. We have an email link to our board on our website by     selecting Contact at the top of the page and then Board of Directors in the drop-down box. Communications sent by email are not confidential and are first reviewed by the Company's general counsel and chief financial officer.
If we amend or grant a waiver of one or more of the provisions of our Code of Ethics, we intend to satisfy the requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding the disclosure of     amendments to or waivers from provisions of our Code of Ethics by posting the required information on our website.
You may view a copy of our Code of Ethics by visiting our website at www.bc.com and selecting Investors at the bottom of the page, then Code of Ethics.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
Our board of directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines (Guidelines) to assist the board in exercising its responsibilities. The Guidelines reflect our board's commitment to     monitor the effectiveness of policy and decision-making, both at the board and management levels. Our board of directors believes the Guidelines will enhance our ability to achieve our goals and long-term success and will assist us in increasing     shareholder value. The Guidelines are in addition to and are not intended to change or interpret any federal or state law or regulation, including the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or the rules of the New     York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). Our board of directors may modify the Guidelines from time to time on the recommendation of the corporate governance and nominating committee and as deemed appropriate by our board of directors.     
You may view a complete copy of the Guidelines by visiting our website at www.bc.com and selecting Investors, then Leadership and Governance, and then Corporate       Governance Guidelines.
Director Independence
Our directors believe board independence is important and is key for the board to function properly, allowing it to provide appropriate oversight and maintain managerial accountability.
We list our common stock on the NYSE. The NYSE rules require that a majority of our directors be independent from management and all members of our board committees be independent. For     a director to be independent under the NYSE's rules, our board must determine affirmatively that he or she has no material relationship with us. Additionally, he or she cannot violate any of the bright line independence tests set forth in the NYSE     listing rules that would prevent our board of directors from determining that he or she was independent. These rules contain heightened independence tests for members of our audit and compensation committees. Our board of directors will broadly     consider all relevant facts and circumstances to determine the independence of any director, in accordance with the NYSE listing rules.
To assist in making this determination, our board adopted the NYSE's independence standards, set forth in the NYSE listing rules and Rules 10A-3 and 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. For     purposes of these standards, we include Boise Cascade Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our board has determined that Ms. Gowland and Messrs. Cooper, Fleming, Hannah, Hogans, Matula, McDougall, and McGowan are independent directors as defined under the NYSE's listing     standards. These directors constitute a majority of our board of directors and represent all of our committee members. In making its independence determination, our board considered the relationships disclosed in the Related-Person/Party       Transactions section below.
Additionally, our board of directors has determined that (i) each member of the audit committee meets the heightened independence standards for audit committee service under the NYSE     listing rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act; and (ii) each member of the compensation committee meets the heightened independence standards for compensation committee service under the NYSE listing rules and Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act.     Further, because our board chair is not independent, our board has appointed the chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee, Mack Hogans, as its lead independent director.
Our board of directors and its committees can retain, at their sole discretion and at our expense, independent financial, legal, compensation, or other advisors to represent the     independent interests of our board of directors or its committees.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of securities ownership     and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Officers, directors, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms     they file.
Based on a review of such reports, we believe that in 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were complied with by our officers, directors, and greater than ten percent beneficial     owners.
Related-Person/Party Transactions
Family Relationships
No family relationships exist between any of our directors and executive officers.
Affiliated-Company Transactions
Mr. Cooper, one of our directors, was the president and chief executive officer of TrueBlue, Inc. (TrueBlue), an industrial staffing company, until December 31, 2018, and he remains its     board chair. In 2018, the Company leased commercial drivers and used other temporary labor services from TrueBlue and its subsidiaries and paid approximately $470,000 for those services.
Policies and Procedures for Related-Person/Party Transactions
Our written policy regarding transactions with related persons requires that a "related person" (as defined in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose to our     general counsel any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we are or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person     has or will have a direct or indirect material interest) in which such related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest and all material facts with respect thereto. The general counsel will promptly communicate such information to     our audit committee or another independent body of our board of directors. No related-person transaction will be entered into without the approval or ratification of our audit committee or another independent body of our board of directors. It is our     policy that directors recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business, or professional interests. Our policy does not specify the standards to be applied by our audit committee or another independent body of our     board of directors in determining whether to approve or ratify a related-person transaction.
Role of Compensation Consultant
The compensation committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), as its independent, compensation consultant to assist the committee in discharging its     responsibilities. Prior to retaining FW Cook, the compensation committee considered that FW Cook does not provide any other services to the Company or management and determined that there was no conflict of interest according to the factors the     compensation committee determined to be relevant, including the independence factors enumerated by the NYSE.
Role of Board of Directors in Our Risk Management Processes
Our board of directors oversees the risk management activities designed and implemented by our management. The board of directors executes its oversight responsibility for risk     management both directly and through its committees. Through our enterprise risk management review, the board of directors also considers specific risk topics, including risks associated with our strategic plan, business operations, cybersecurity, and     capital structure. In addition, the board of directors receives detailed regular reports from members of our senior management and other personnel that include assessments and potential mitigation of the risks and exposures involved with their     respective areas of responsibility.
Our board of directors delegates to the audit committee oversight of our risk management process. Our other board committees also consider and address risk as they perform their     respective committee responsibilities. All committees report to the full board of directors as appropriate, including when a matter rises to the level of a material- or enterprise-level risk.
Our internal audit department annually develops a risk-based audit plan that is reviewed with the audit committee, along with the results of internal audit reviews and activities. The     internal audit department also maintains a high level assessment of risks and controls for key operations, functions, processes, applications, and systems within the Company. The audit committee meets a number of times each year with our director of     internal audit, our chief financial officer, and our controller. The audit committee also meets at least once per year with our director of IT to discuss security as it relates to our data systems.
We also have in place a number of independent assurance activities responsible for assessing whether our risk response activities are in place and working effectively. These assurance     activities include, but are not limited to, corporate legal audits, corporate data security, environmental audits, and safety audits.     
Risk Analysis of Employee Compensation Policies and Practices
We reviewed our compensation policies and practices for our employees and determined these policies and practices do not induce our employees to take unacceptable levels of business     risk for the purpose of increasing their incentive plan awards at the expense of shareholder interests. Some of the considerations in making this determination were:
Director Selection Process
Our corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for, among other matters:
Through this process, members of the corporate governance and nominating committee consult with our board chair and accept nominee recommendations from other directors and/or     shareholders in accordance with the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation and our bylaws. The invitation to join our board of directors is extended by our board of directors through our board chair. Our lead independent director serves as the chair     of our corporate governance and nominating committee.
Suitability of Candidates
In evaluating the suitability of candidates, in addition to our ongoing and emerging business needs, our board of directors and corporate governance and nominating committee consider     many factors, including a candidate's:
The corporate governance and nominating committee is committed to a highly functioning board where the composition is reflective of the long-term strategy of the business, and makes     decisions primarily on the basis of skills, qualifications, and experience.
Our current board has a rich mixture of educational, professional, and experiential diversity. As opportunities to appoint new directors become available in the     future, in addition to the factors set forth above, our board of directors will consider other factors, including gender, racial, ethnic, and global diversity for director recruitment.
Shareholder Nominations for Directors
In accordance with our bylaws, the corporate governance and nominating committee will consider shareholder nominations for directors (please refer to the Shareholder        Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement section in this proxy statement for related instructions). We did not receive any shareholder nomination or recommendation for a director in connection with the 2019 annual meeting. The     corporate governance and nominating committee has not adopted formal policies regarding shareholder nominations for directors because the additional committee does not believe such policy is necessary for the consideration of shareholder nominations.
Board and Committee Self-Evaluations
Our directors conduct annual self-evaluations of our board of directors and its committees. These evaluations assess the overall effectiveness of our board of     directors. The chairman of the board and lead independent director review the directors' responses and provide the individual board members, the corporate governance and nominating committee, and the full board with an assessment of the performance of     the board and its committees. The directors then discuss the results and proposed actions in executive session. The purpose of the evaluation is to increase the effectiveness of our board, its committees, and our directors.
Board Governance
The board believes that wider perspective and best practices learned by board members serving in other public directorships must be balanced against the time     commitment that service on boards entails. Therefore, our Guidelines include an overboarding policy whereby our non-employee directors are limited to no more than three public boards, in addition to ours, and our chief executive officer to one     additional public board. You can view the Guidelines by visiting our website at www.bc.com and selecting Investors, Leadership and Governance and then Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Communications with Our Board of Directors
Shareholders and other interested parties may contact our board of directors, or any of its committees, non-management directors or any individual directors by writing     to the chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee, at the address or email address shown below. All correspondence will be referred to the chairman of the governance and nominating committee, the chairman of the board, and our     general counsel.

Email: legaldepartment@bc.com
Shareholders and other interested parties may also contact our board of directors by going to our website, www.bc.com, and selecting Contact at the top of the     page, then selecting Board of Directors in the drop down box.
Board Leadership Structure
Currently the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are filled separately. Our board of directors believes that this structure is appropriate for the Company at this time.     Mr. Carlile's (our chairman of the board) experience as our former chief executive officer provides our board of directors with valuable insight on operational and industry issues.
On February 4, 2013, our corporate governance and nominating committee and our board of directors adopted the Guidelines to serve as a flexible framework within which the board conducts     business. The committee and board routinely review the Guidelines with the most recent review occurring on February 22, 2018. On October 28, 2015, our board formalized our practice that the chair of the governance and nominating committee serves as the     lead independent director. Mack Hogans currently fills the lead independent director role. Our lead independent director presides over all meetings of the independent directors and works collaboratively with our chairman and chief executive officer     regarding board governance, including the board evaluation process and establishing meeting agendas for our board.
Executive Sessions and Independent Director Sessions
Our board of directors and each of our committees routinely meet in executive sessions outside the presence of management. Mr. Carlile, our chairman of the board, presides over the     executive sessions of our board of directors, and each committee chair presides over the executive sessions of each respective committee. Mr. Hogans, our lead independent director, and the chair of our corporate governance and nominating committee,     presides over the sessions of our independent board members who meet outside the presence of our non-independent directors at least twice per year.
2018     Meeting Attendance
During 2018, our board of directors met five times in person and four times by telephone conference. Our board also acted pursuant to written resolution five times during 2018. In     addition to meetings of the full board, our board committees met a total of 14 times. As a group, our directors had an overall attendance rate of 98%.
Under the Guidelines, our directors are expected to attend our annual meeting to be held on May 2, 2019. Nine of our ten directors attended the 2018 annual meeting.
Board Committees
Our board of directors has established the following three standing committees:
The composition, duties, and responsibilities of these committees are outlined in written charters adopted by our board of directors. Each committee charter is reviewed annually by its     respective committee to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws and sound governance practices and reviewed periodically by outside legal counsel. Each committee enacts any recommended changes to its charter coming out of such reviews and     reports the changes to our board of directors.
You may view copies of our committee charters by visiting our website at www.bc.com and selecting Investors at the bottom of the page and then Leadership and Governance. You      are then able to select any of the committee charters.

BOARD COMPENSATION
Employee board members do not receive compensation for their service on our board of directors. Mr. Corrick is currently our only employee board member. Nonemployee board members in     2018 were entitled to receive the compensation described below under "Director Fees."
2018 Director Compensation Table
The following table presents compensation information for each of our nonemployee directors for the year ended December 31, 2018:
Director Fees
The 2018 retainer and fee schedule for nonemployee directors is set forth herein.  The board recently approved a new retainer and fee schedule for 2019 on the advice of FW Cook who     performed a review of our non-employee director compensation program on behalf of the compensation committee.  This review included an analysis of market trends relating to non-employee director compensation and a comparison of our non-employee     director compensation relative to market data of our peer group (as set forth on page 23), and market data of similarly sized companies.
2018 Director Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, our board of directors on February 22, 2018 approved the granting of 2,091 RSUs with a grant date fair value equal to $90,018 to     each of our nonemployee directors. The board chairman received an additional 580 RSUs with a grant date fair value equal to $24,969. These 2018 RSU awards are service-condition vesting awards that vested in full on February 22, 2019 and were     distributed on February 25, 2019.
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan
We maintain a "nonqualified" deferred compensation plan offered to our nonemployee directors. The plan is an unfunded plan intended to help participants supplement their retirement     income while providing them an opportunity to invest a portion of their cash compensation. Under the plan, each director who receives cash compensation for board service may elect to defer all or a portion of his or her cash compensation in a calendar     year. Amounts deferred are credited with imputed interest at a rate equal to 130% of Moody's Composite Average of Yields on Corporate Bonds. Participants elect the form and timing of distributions of their deferred compensation balances. Participants     may receive cash payment in a lump sum or in annual installments following their service on our board of directors. Ms. Gowland and Messrs. Matula and Cooper have elected to defer cash compensation in 2016 through 2018 under this plan. We do not     anticipate making any changes to this plan in 2019.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During 2018, the compensation committee consisted of Ms. Gowland, Mr. Hannah, Mr. Matula, and Mr. McDougall. None of our executive officers currently serve, or in the past year served,     as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee.
STOCK OWNERSHIP
Stock Ownership Guidelines for Our Directors
In August 2018, our board of directors updated the established Company stock ownership guidelines for our directors, which are intended to ensure that our directors acquire and maintain     an equity stake in the Company and more closely align their interests with those of our shareholders.
Our director stock ownership guidelines provide that within five years from becoming a director, each director should acquire and maintain stock ownership in the Company equal to five     times his or her annual cash retainer.
Stock Ownership Guidelines for Our Officers
In August 2018, our board of directors updated the established Company stock ownership guidelines for our officers which are intended to ensure that our officers acquire and maintain an     equity stake in the Company and more closely align their interests with those of our shareholders.
Our officer stock ownership guidelines provide that within five years of the later of becoming an officer, or adoption of new guidelines, that the officer meet the guidelines. Ownership     varies by officer level with the chief executive officer's target at five times salary, executive vice presidents' and senior vice presidents' target at two times salary, and vice presidents' target at one times salary.

During 2018, all services by our independent registered public accounting firm were preapproved by the audit committee in accordance with this policy.
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION
Boise Cascade became a public company on February 6, 2013. Our board of directors adopted the 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan (2013 Incentive Plan) on February 4, 2013, in anticipation     of the consummation of our initial public offering. From 2013 through April 2016, our compensation committee approved all equity grants under the 2013 Incentive Plan. Following shareholder approval of the 2016 Boise Cascade Omnibus Incentive Plan (2016     Incentive Plan) all grants are made under that plan, and no awards may be granted under the 2013 Incentive Plan. The following table provides information about our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2018:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This CD&A describes the 2018 compensation program for our executive officers, particularly our named executive officers who are listed below, along with the positions they held with     the Company as of December 31, 2018:
Our Compensation Objectives and Philosophy
We want to attract, retain, and incent the management talent we believe is essential to achieving the Company's strategic objectives, which are to grow the Company prudently and to     increase long-term shareholder value. As a guiding philosophy, we target all forms of compensation at the 50th percentile of comparable market compensation data, taking     into account each person's position, responsibilities, performance, contributions to the Company's success, level of experience, and other distinguishing characteristics. In some instances and for the purpose of internal equity, we may establish     similar compensation ranges for officer positions with similar scopes of responsibility and other similar characteristics even if such ranges differ from comparable positions at other companies. We also provide at-risk pay opportunities that comprise a     significant portion of total compensation opportunity to motivate and reward our executive officers for achieving the Company's strategic objectives.
As a public company, 2014 was the first year that we held nonbinding advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation. The first vote was on the frequency of holding an advisory     vote on our executive compensation, and the shareholders advised a preference for an annual vote. At the July 2014 board meeting, the board agreed to an annual vote on "say-on-pay." In each subsequent year, our shareholders have approved our executive     compensation with well over 95% voting in favor: 99.6%, 98.5%, 98.1%, 99.4%, and 97.4% from 2014 through 2018. We believe the strong support demonstrates that shareholders generally view our overall pay program favorably. The compensation committee     took this support into account and, as such, no substantial program changes were made for 2019. The compensation committee and the board intend to continue to take these advisory votes into account regarding future compensation decisions. For 2019,     shareholders will again vote on whether to approve our executive compensation as set forth in this proxy statement.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Use of Market Data to Determine Amount and Allocation of Compensation
The compensation committee believes that an important criterion for the determination of the aggregate value of the Company's compensation program and the allocation of the value among     the various elements of its compensation plans is market data, where available, on the amounts, allocations, and structures utilized by similarly situated peer companies for positions of comparable responsibility.
Management and the compensation committee have utilized compensation and benefits surveys to ascertain market levels of aggregate compensation and the allocation of that compensation     among specific compensation elements for its named executive officers. Aggregate compensation and compensation for each of the major elements (base salary, short-term incentive compensation, and long-term incentive compensation) for the Company's named     executive officers has generally been targeted at the 50th percentile of the surveyed peer-group companies. However, the specific aggregate compensation (and the allocation among the elements of the total compensation) paid to any of our named     executive officers may be below or above the 50th percentile target levels, depending on subjective judgments made by the compensation committee based on factors such as     the specific officer's responsibilities that vary from the benchmark position, historical performance in the job, tenure with the Company and in his or her position, and other distinguishing characteristics.
Since 2011, the compensation committee has retained periodically the services of FW Cook, a compensation consultant, to prepare a comprehensive analysis of the compensation packages for     our named executive officers and to compare the specific elements of compensation and the aggregate value with a group of peer companies recommended by the consultant.
FW Cook conducted a review of our peer companies with our compensation committee in 2017 and recommended that the paper and packaging companies be removed from our 2018 peer group due     to lack of similarity with our business, Nortek Inc. be removed because it was acquired and is no longer a publicly listed company, and American Woodwork be added.  The Compensation Committee agreed with the recommendations and adopted the 2018 peer     group as follows:
During 2018, the compensation committee reviewed the officer severance agreements, the Company's STIPs, FW Cook's fees, and the proposed peer group for 2019 compensation discussions,     adopting FW Cook's recommendation to remove Ply Gem Holdings, Inc. from the peer group for 2019 compensation discussions because it is no longer a publicly listed company.  The compensation committee reapproved double-trigger officer severance     agreements containing no additional compensation or benefits for officers, and reviewed and reapproved its compensation philosophy as it appears in this proxy statement.
Summary of Pay Decisions Affecting our Named Executive Officers' Compensation in 2018
For 2018, our compensation committee again chose to grant 50% of the long-term incentive grant value in RSUs and 50% in PSUs. The RSUs vest and are paid in shares one-third each year     over a three-year period. The PSUs, however, are designed to have a one-year performance target based on Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) with a cliff vest and are paid in shares two years thereafter to better align with the long-term interests of     shareholders. The STIP is an annual cash-based plan with performance goals based on EBITDA and PRONWC.
The compensation committee also made salary adjustments for our executive officers in late 2018 to reflect several promotions, the changing median pay in our peer companies, and     individual officer performance.
Executive Compensation Elements
The five elements of the Company's executive compensation are:
Role of Management in Setting Executive and Director Compensation
As described below, the compensation committee increased the compensation of our executives for 2018. Management did not participate in such decisions. However, the Company's chief     executive officer makes, and in 2018 made, recommendations to the compensation committee with respect to base salaries and performance targets for the Company's STIP and LTIP for officers other than himself. The compensation committee makes all     decisions regarding each named executive officer's base salary, LTIP and STIP targets, the overall performance targets of the plans, and the potential and actual payouts under each plan. Management does not participate in setting director compensation.
Base Salary
Our compensation committee has historically reviewed base salaries for our named executive officers on an annual basis and at the time of promotions or other changes in     responsibilities. In late 2018, the compensation committee approved general base salary increases for the named executive officers, to continue to move them, as determined appropriate, toward the 50th percentile based upon FW Cook's 2018 study. The     2018 increases in named executive officer salaries averaged 4.3% and were in line with market data provided by FW Cook. The earnings for our named executive officers over the last three years can be found in the Summary Compensation Table. Current base     salaries and 2018 base salary increases are listed below:
Short Term Incentive Plan  
The STIP is designed to recognize and reward the contributions that named executive officers and other participants make to the Company's annual performance. Payout of the STIP is based     on achievement of performance measures that are tied to the Company's annual financial performance. We offer this plan to encourage and reward conduct that will lead to better performance of our businesses as measured by the performance criteria. Each     named executive officer's participation in the plan, along with the criteria for calculation of the payout, is established annually by action of our compensation committee and communicated to the participants in an STIP award notice. A determination of     the amount payable under the plan based on actual performance is made by the compensation committee generally in February of the following year, and resulting payments or awards are made to participants. At the compensation committee meeting in     February 2019, the committee used its di9scretion and adjusted the calculation of EBITDA achieved for the 2018 calendar year to exclude the impact of the changes for the Strategic Actions, and the pension risk transfer transactions.
The actual STIP awards may be less than or greater than the target incentive amounts depending on the achievement of pre-determined financial goals and performance objectives and the     exercise of the compensation committee's discretion. For 2018, the compensation committee set a threshold of 25% of the target award as the minimum award to be granted under the program. The compensation committee also set a maximum of 225% of the     target award based on financial goals for 2018 and approved a payout graph with a payout line whereby once the level of performance is determined the award multiplier can be determined. The dollar amount of the threshold, target, and maximum award     payable to each of our named executive officers is set out in the table found under "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" in this section of this proxy statement.
For 2018, each of our named executive officers participated in the STIP. The plan provided for awards to be determined based on the extent to which the financial goals and performance     objectives were met during the year, subject to the compensation committee's discretion. The performance metrics established by the compensation committee under our 2018 STIP were based on a forecast of 1.27 million U.S. housing starts, a primary     metric in our business. The annual incentive target awards, financial goals, and performance objectives required for each named executive officers are set forth below:
2018 STIP Compensation 
2018 Ad Hoc Discretionary Bonus Awards
From time to time, the compensation committee may elect to grant a discretionary bonus to one or more of the named executive officers or to other employees to recognize and reward     exemplary performance providing value to the Company beyond what is recognized by the structure of the Company's STIP. These bonus payments are not governed by any formal plan, and no named executive officer has any contractual entitlement or     expectation of any such payment. The amount and timing of the grant of any such bonus to named executive officers are determined by the compensation committee at its sole discretion. No such bonus was awarded in 2018 to the named executive officers.
LTIPs (2013 Incentive Plan and 2016 Incentive Plan - collectively the Plans)
The Boise Cascade Company board of directors approved the 2013 Incentive Plan before our initial public offering. The 2013 Incentive Plan was replaced by the 2016 Incentive Plan by     shareholder vote at our 2016 annual meeting. Both Plans were designed to align executive and shareholder interests and to drive long-term business results.     
We made equity grants to certain directors and executive officers in 2016 under the 2013 Incentive Plan, and in 2017 and 2018 under the 2016 Incentive Plan.
The 2016 Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other stock-based awards, other cash-based compensation, and performance     awards. Directors, officers, and other employees, as well as others performing consulting or advisory services are eligible for grants under the 2016 Incentive Plan. The purpose of the 2016 Incentive Plan is to provide incentives that will attract,     retain, and motivate high-performing officers, directors, employees, and consultants by providing them a proprietary interest in our long-term success or compensation based on their performance in fulfilling their responsibilities to our Company.
Both Plans are administered by our compensation committee.
The Plans provide that awards granted under the Plans are subject to any recoupment policy we may have, including the clawback of "incentive-based compensation" under the Exchange Act     or under any applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.
LTIP Awards
In February 2018, the compensation committee approved equity grants under the 2016 Incentive Plan. The amount and structure of the grants were based on a study conducted by FW Cook and     the recommendations FW Cook made as a result of the study. Officer participants under the 2016 Incentive Plan received two types of grants: RSUs and PSUs.
Beginning in 2016, FW Cook recommended, and the compensation committee began setting a dollar target rather than a percentage-of-salary target to calculate the RSU and PSU grants on the     day of the award after market close. Half of the value of the target award was granted in RSUs. The other half of the target award was granted in PSUs.
The RSUs awarded vest over a three-year period with one-third vesting on March 1 on each of 2019, 2020, and 2021, with share distribution the following day. The PSUs awarded as target     are adjusted by a performance factor determined by the performance objectives listed below and may be further adjusted at the discretion of the compensation committee. The performance-adjusted PSUs vest in a single installment on March 1, 2021, with     share distribution the following day.
The 2018 LTIP awards were based on a closing market value on February 22, 2018 of $43.05 and are as follows:
The PSUs awarded are earned based on a one-year ROIC performance established by the compensation committee. The compensation committee chose ROIC as the performance metric to     differentiate from the EBITDA measure used in the STIP because it believed ROIC would put a focus on short-term and long-term investments and reinforce the importance of shareholder returns. If ROIC is below threshold as shown above, no PSUs are     earned. At threshold performance, 50% of the PSUs are earned, and at maximum performance, 200% of the PSUs are earned. The compensation committee approved a payout scale such that when results fall between the threshold and maximum reference points,     linear interpolation is used to determine the actual PSUs to be awarded.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to a named executive officer's continued employment through the vest date(s), except in certain limited circumstances. If a named executive officer     dies or becomes disabled, (i) all unvested RSUs become vested and (ii) all earned PSUs for which the performance metric has been satisfied become vested at that amount. In the event the performance year applicable to the PSUs has not elapsed at the     time of such death or disability, the PSUs will vest based on actual achievement of the performance metric. In the event of a named executive's eligible retirement, (i) unvested RSUs become vested as to 1/3 of the award, multiplied by a pro rata     portion based on the number of full calendar months that has elapsed during the then 12-month vesting period prior to retirement, divided by 12, and (ii) earned PSUs become vested as to a pro rata portion based on the number of full calendar months     that has elapsed during the vesting period prior to retirement, divided by 36. For purposes of LTIP vesting, retirement means the named executive officer's termination after attainment of age 62 and completion of at least 15 years of employment with     the Company and its predecessors, or age 65 and completion of at least five years of employment with the Company. In the event of a change in control in which the LTIP awards are not replaced by an equivalent award, (i) RSUs become vested and (ii)     unearned PSUs become vested at target and PSUs for which the performance metric has been satisfied and, therefore, are subject to time-vesting, become vested.
Other Compensation and Benefit Plans
The Company's named executive officers receive additional compensation under a few other compensation and benefit plans. These plans and benefits, except those that are frozen or closed     to new entrants, are provided to create an aggregate compensation and benefits package that is competitive in the marketplace, thereby, helping us to attract and retain the management talent needed to achieve the Company's strategic objectives.
Financial Counseling Program
We provide limited perquisites to our executive officers.  Under our financial counseling program, up to $5,000 in expenses per calendar year incurred by officers for professional tax     preparation, planning and compliance, investment planning, and estate planning will be paid by the Company.  Unused amounts up to one year's allowance ($5,000) may be carried over from year to year.
Boise Cascade Pension Plan
Effective December 31, 2009, the compensation committee froze the pension benefit for all of our salaried employees including our named executive officers. The frozen benefit is now in     the Boise Cascade Pension Plan (BCPP). On December 31, 2009, the compensation committee also froze our supplemental pension plans in which all of our named executive officers participated. Since December 31, 2009, none of our named executive officers     has earned any additional pension benefit.
The BCPP entitles each vested employee to receive an annual pension benefit at normal retirement age as determined by a formula involving the average of the highest five consecutive     years of the employee's compensation out of the last 10 years of employment through December 31, 2009 (Average High Five) times an annual factor for each year of service. Under the BCPP, "compensation" is defined as the employee's taxable base salary     plus any taxable amounts earned under our annual variable incentive compensation programs. For each year of service prior to December 31, 2003, the annual factor was equal to 1.25%, and for each year of service from January 1, 2004 through December 31,     2009, the annual factor was equal to 1%. The value of the pension benefit is determined by adding the products of: 1) the Average High Five times the number of years of service prior to December 31, 2003, times 1.25% and; 2) the Average High Five times     the number of years of service between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009, times 1%. Under this formula, benefits are computed on a straight-line annuity basis and are not offset by Social Security or other retirement benefits. An employee is 100%     vested in the pension benefit after five years of unbroken service.
The Supplemental Pension Plan
While the pension plan was in effect, if an employee earned income in excess of the limits provided under the Internal Revenue Code for qualified plans, or if income was deferred under     the Company's deferred compensation plan and not taxed (and, therefore, not counted for purposes of the benefit amount calculation under the qualified BCPP), the additional benefits were accrued and will be paid from the Company's general assets under     our unfunded, nonqualified Supplemental Pension Plan (SUPP). Because the benefit definition in the SUPP is a derivative of that contained in the BCPP described above, the benefit freeze adopted for the qualified plan at year-end 2009 effected a similar     freeze in further benefit accruals under the SUPP as of the same date. All of our named executive officers have a benefit under the SUPP.
The Supplemental Early Retirement Plan
Under our unfunded, non-qualified Supplemental Early Retirement Plan (SERP), an officer was eligible for benefits under the plan if the officer: (i) was an officer of OfficeMax     immediately prior to the 2004 Forest Products Acquisition; (ii) is 55 years old or older (or 58 years old or older for officers elected on or after June 1, 2004, and before October 29, 2004); (iii) has ten or more years of service; (iv) has served as     an officer for at least five full years; and (v) retires before the age of 65 (or in certain cases age 62). Eligible officers retiring prior to age 65 receive an early retirement benefit from the SERP which, in combination with their benefit under the     BCPP and the SUPP, equals the benefit calculated under the BCPP and the SUPP without reduction due to the officer's early retirement. Because the benefit definition in the SERP is a derivative of that contained in the BCPP described above, the benefit     freeze adopted for the pension at year-end 2009 effected a similar freeze in further benefit accruals under the SERP. Benefits payable under the SERP are offset in part by benefits payable under a similar plan maintained by OfficeMax. Mr. Rancourt will     become eligible for benefits under the SERP when he reaches age 58, if he is still employed by the Company, and Mr. Stokes is now eligible under the SERP. Messrs. Corrick, Hutchinson, and Sahlberg do not participate in the SERP.
The Present Value of Pension Benefits
The aggregate, present value of pension defined benefits as of December 31, 2018, for each of our named executive officers under each plan are disclosed in the table found under the     heading "Pension Benefits" of this CD&A. Changes in the present value for the pension benefits for each named executive officer are disclosed in footnote 5 to the "Summary Compensation Table."
The Boise Cascade Company Savings Plan
The Company maintains a 401(k) defined-contribution savings plan for all of its U.S. salaried employees, including its named executive officers. Under the plan, eligible employees     electing to participate may contribute up to 50% of their pretax income, subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules limiting an individual's total contributions and the application of IRS tests designed to ensure that the plan does not     discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
Since January 2013, the Company has provided a contribution to each salaried employee's 401(k) account for each pay period in an amount equal to 4% of the employee's eligible wages     (base salary and short-term incentive compensation) for the period. If the Company's EBITDA meets or exceeds targets specified by the compensation committee and the board of directors, the Company is able to make additional discretionary contributions     in an amount equal to up to 2%, 3%, or 4% of the employee's wages, depending on the affected employee's number of years of service. For 2018, the compensation committee and the board set an EBITDA performance threshold of $175 million and maximum of     $250 million. The Company approved a payout scale so that when performance falls between the threshold and maximum levels linear interpolation is used to determine the actual award. Amounts in excess of IRS annual limitations on the amount of income on     which Company contributions may be made to qualified defined contribution retirement plans are paid to participants as taxable cash compensation and/or credited to the participant's deferred compensation account. In 2018, the Company's performance,     after discretionary adjustments made by the compensation committee, exceeded the maximum EBITDA threshold. All of our named executive officers participate in the plan.
Amounts deferred under this plan by the named executive officers are included in the salary disclosure in the "Summary Compensation Table," and amounts contributed by the Company to the     account of a named executive officer under the plan are included in the "All Other Compensation" column in the "Summary Compensation Table."
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
Our 2004 Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified, defined contribution plan that was reopened for participation effective January 1, 2014. Under the deferred     compensation plan, participating employees irrevocably elect each year to defer receipt of a portion of their base salary and incentive compensation. A participant's account is credited with an amount equal to what the Company's 401(k) contribution     would have been if the money had not been deferred and with imputed interest at a rate equal to 130% of Moody's Composite Average of Yields on Corporate Bonds. Participants may receive payment of their deferred compensation plan balance in a lump sum     or in installments over a specified period of years following the termination of their employment with the Company. Each of our named executive officers is a participant in our deferred compensation plan. Amounts deferred under this plan in any     relevant year or contributed to the account under the plan by any of our named executive officers are disclosed in the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table."
Salaried Employee Life Insurance Plan and Officers' Supplemental Life Plan
The Company maintains two plans under which Company-paid life insurance is made available to its officers. Under its Salaried Employee Life Insurance Plan for which all of our salaried     employees participate, the Company provides, at its expense during each salaried employee's period of employment, life insurance in an amount equal to the employee's base salary. Messrs. Corrick, Hutchinson, Rancourt, and Sahlberg participate in this     plan.
Mr. Stokes participates in our Officers' Supplemental Life Plan, which is closed to new participants, and under which a Company-paid life insurance benefit during employment is provided     in an amount equal to two times the officer's base salary.
Amounts paid by the Company for the coverage provided to each of our named executive officers is reported in the column titled "All Other Compensation" in the "Summary Compensation     Table."
Agreements with Named Executive Officers
The Company does not have employment agreements with any of its named executive officers other than the limited agreements described in this section.
Severance Agreements with Messrs. Corrick, Rancourt, Stokes, Hutchinson, and Sahlberg
The Company entered into severance agreements with each of the named executive officers (except Mr. Hutchinson) in February 2008 to maintain operating continuity in the event of a     change of control. The Company entered into revised severance agreements with each of its named executive officers in December 2012 and in August 2016 solely to bring the agreements into technical compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and     entered into an agreement in 2014 with Mr. Hutchinson due to his promotion.
The severance agreements are effective for three years from the anniversary date, but unless the Company gives notice 60 days prior to the second anniversary or each anniversary     thereafter, the term of each severance agreement will be automatically extended for an additional year. Notice was not given prior to the anniversary date in 2018. Accordingly, the term of such agreements has now been extended to 2020.
The severance agreements for the named executive officers provide that in the event of a "qualifying termination" (meaning any termination with the exception of a termination (i) by the     Company for cause or disability; (ii) by the employee other than for good reason (as described in the severance agreement); or (iii) as a result of the employee's death), an employee will be entitled to receive (a) his or her full base salary through     the date of termination, a STIP payment for the year of termination based on the plan's actual payout for the year and pro-rated to reflect the portion of the year expired, and all other compensation to which he or she is then entitled; (b) a lump-sum     severance payment equal to two times the sum of the employee's annual base salary plus target STIP for the year in which the termination occurs; and (c) a lump-sum amount equal to the value of such employee's unused and accrued time off, less any     advanced time off, in accordance with the applicable time-off policy in effect on the termination date. Additionally, the severance agreements provide, in the event of a qualifying termination, for full maintenance of healthcare and insurance benefits     for a period of 12 or 18 months following the termination date (subject to payment of required contributions), payment of the premium under the Company's Supplemental Life Plan for 24 months following the termination date, and if applicable, receipt of     the monthly benefit that such employee would have been entitled to receive under the SERP as if such employee had satisfied the age and service requirements under the SERP as of his or her termination date. The higher levels of severance benefits are     generally reserved for those officers at the level of senior vice president and higher, which includes all of our named executive officers.
In the event of a change in control, the agreements require a second trigger of a qualifying termination from employment before benefits are payable.
The severance agreements provide that in the event of a non-qualifying termination, the employee will be entitled to receive his or her full base salary through the date of termination,     plus all other compensation to which he or she is then entitled. In the event of a failure to perform duties as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness or injury, the employee will be entitled to continue to receive the full base     salary until such time as employment is terminated due to disability. No severance payments or continuation of healthcare benefits beyond the date of termination are provided for under such circumstances.
In consideration of the severance payments described above, each severance agreement contains confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions, and a general release of all claims     against the Company and its affiliates, as a condition of payment of benefits under the severance agreement.
Summary Compensation Table
Role of Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the tax code limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to our chief executive officer and certain other executive officers to $1 million per officer in any     taxable year. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the exception from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for "performance-based" compensation has been repealed, unless the compensation qualifies for certain transition relief.      The Compensation Committee retains the flexibility and discretion to structure compensation programs and authorize compensation that may not be deductible, including as a result of the changes made to Section 162(m) of the tax code, as described above.     This flexibility is necessary for elements of the Company's success, such as attracting and retaining talented executives and rewarding achievement of the Company's strategic objectives.

In February 2013, the 2004 deferred compensation plan was reopened for contributions effective January 1, 2014. Earnings on contributions and preexisting plan balances continued to     accrue during 2018 in accordance with the terms of the plan.

In 2018, contributions to the deferred compensation plan received from the Company     included a 4% base contribution and applicable discretionary contribution to simulate the base contribution and discretionary contribution in the 401(k) plan. Aggregate earnings and year-end plan balances for each of our named executive officers are     disclosed in the table below:
For more information concerning our nonqualified deferred compensation plan, see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" under "Other Compensation and Benefit Plans" in this proxy     statement.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The following tables reflect an estimate of the compensation the Company would have been required to pay to each of its named executive officers under the compensation plans, contracts,     agreements, and arrangements between each such individual and the Company for:
The amounts shown assume that such termination or change in control was effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amounts the Company would have been required to pay on other dates     may be determined only at the time of separation from the Company or the change in control and will accordingly vary from those disclosed here, which are based on a hypothetical December 31, 2018, termination. The amounts disclosed here do not include     amounts earned by the named executive officer through that time as base salary, any bonuses approved by the compensation committee prior to that date, and payments earned prior to that date such as 2018 awards earned pursuant to our STIP because     neither their amount nor the timing of the payment is affected by the fact or the nature of the termination of employment. In addition, the disclosure does not include amounts payable pursuant to the 401(k), deferred compensation, or pension plans,     which are disclosed elsewhere in the CD&A.
The availability of severance payments and continued healthcare and insurance benefits beyond termination of employment is contractually conditioned for each of our named executive     officers on their provision to the Company of a release of claims arising from their employment and the termination thereof and their performance of contractual confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement obligations contained in their     employment or severance agreements with the Company, as well as payment of applicable contributions for healthcare and insurance benefits. The payments described in the tables and textual materials that follow are provided by severance agreements and     the terms of the 2013 Incentive Plan and the 2016 Incentive Plan. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see "LTIPs" and "Agreements with named executive officers" in the CD&A.
