COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING PROCESS
Who is soliciting my proxy?
The Board of Directors of Black Hills Corporation is soliciting your proxy.
Where and when is the annual meeting?
The annual meeting is at 9:30 a.m., local time, April 30, 2019 at Horizon Point, the Company's corporate headquarters, 7001 Mount Rushmore Road, Rapid City, South Dakota.
Who can vote?
Holders of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date, March 1, 2019, can vote at our annual meeting. Each share of our common stock has one vote for Proposals 2 and 3. Related to Proposal 1, Election of Directors, cumulative voting is permitted in the election of directors in the same class. 
How do I vote?
There are three ways to vote by proxy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by calling the toll free telephone number on the enclosed proxy; 
• by using the Internet by going to the website identified on the enclosed proxy; or 
• by returning the enclosed proxy in the envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
You may be able to vote by telephone or the Internet if your shares are held in the name of a bank or broker. If this is the case, you will need to follow their instructions.
What constitutes a quorum?
Shareholders representing at least 50 percent of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date must be present at the annual meeting, either in person or by proxy, for there to be a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.
What am I voting on and what is the required vote for the proposals to be adopted?
The required vote and method of counting votes for the various business matters to be considered at the annual meeting are described in the table below.  If you sign and return your proxy card without indicating your vote, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board recommendations as set forth below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Item of Business Board RecommendationVoting Approval Standard Effect of Abstention Effect of Broker  Non-Vote
  Item of Business Board RecommendationVoting Approval Standard Effect of Abstention Effect of Broker  Non-Vote
  Proposal 1: FOR election of each director nominee  The four nominees with the most "FOR" votes are elected. No effect No effect 
  Election of Directors   
  Proposal 2: FOR The majority of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote. No effect Not applicable; broker may vote shares without instruction 
  Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
  Proposal 3: FOR The majority of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote. No effect No effect 
  Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation   
  This advisory vote is not binding on the Board, but the Board will consider the vote results when making future executive compensation decisions. 
[END TABLE]
Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors?
In the election of directors, you may cumulate your vote. Cumulative voting allows you to allocate among the director nominees in the same class, as you see fit, the total number of votes equal to the number of director positions to be filled multiplied by the number of shares you hold. For example, if you own 100 shares of stock, and there are three directors to be elected at the annual meeting, you could allocate 300 "For" votes (three times 100) among as few or as many of the three nominees to be voted on at the annual meeting as you choose.
If you choose to cumulate your votes, you will need to submit a proxy card or a ballot and make an explicit statement of your intent to cumulate your votes, either by indicating in writing on the proxy card or by indicating in writing on your ballot when voting at the annual meeting. If you hold shares beneficially in street name and wish to cumulate votes, you should contact your broker, trustee or nominee.
How will my shares be voted if they are held in a broker's name?
If you hold your shares through an account with a bank or broker, the bank or broker may vote your shares on some matters even if you do not provide voting instructions. Brokerage firms have the authority under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules to vote shares on certain matters (such as the ratification of auditors) when their customers do not provide voting instructions. However, on most other matters when the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from its customers, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that matter and a "broker non-vote" occurs. This means that brokers may not vote your shares on the election of directors or on the "say on pay" advisory vote if you have not given your broker specific instructions as to how to vote. Please be sure to give specific voting instructions to your broker so that your vote can be counted.
What should I do now?
You should vote your shares by telephone, by the Internet or by returning your signed and dated proxy card in the enclosed envelope as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at the annual meeting. Who will count the vote?
Representatives of our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company (previously Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.), will count the votes and serve as judges of the election. 
Who conducts the proxy solicitation and how much will it cost?
We are asking for your proxy for the annual meeting and will pay all the costs of asking for shareholder proxies. We have hired Georgeson LLC to help us send out the proxy materials and ask for proxies. Georgeson LLC's fee for these services is anticipated to be $8,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses. We can ask for proxies through the mail or by telephone, fax, or in person. We can use our directors, officers and employees to ask for proxies. These people do not receive additional compensation for these services. We will reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of our common stock.
Can I revoke my proxy?
Yes. You can change your vote in one of four ways at any time before your proxy is used. First, you can enter a new vote by telephone or Internet. Second, you can revoke your proxy by written notice. Third, you can send a later dated proxy changing your vote. Fourth, you can attend the meeting and vote in person.
Who should I call with questions?
If you have questions about the annual meeting, you should call Brian G. Iverson, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary at (605) 721-1700.
When are the shareholder proposals due for the 2020 annual meeting?
In order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials, you must submit proposals for next year's annual meeting in writing to our Corporate Secretary at our executive offices at 7001 Mount Rushmore Road, P.O. Box 1400, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709, on or prior to November 16, 2019.
A shareholder who intends to submit a proposal for consideration, but not for inclusion in our proxy materials, must provide written notice to our Corporate Secretary in accordance with Article I, Section 9 of our Bylaws. In general, our Bylaws provide that the written notice must be delivered not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. Our 2019 annual meeting is scheduled for April 30, 2019. Ninety days prior to the first anniversary of this date will be January 31, 2020, and 120 days prior to the first anniversary of this date will be  January 1, 2020.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Our Board is nominating four individuals for election as directors at this annual meeting. All of the nominees are currently serving as our directors. In accordance with our Bylaws and Article VI of our Articles of Incorporation, members of our Board of Directors are elected to three classes of staggered terms consisting of three years each, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. At this annual meeting, three directors will be elected to Class I for a term of three years until our annual meeting in 2022, and one director will be elected to Class III to complete the remainder of the term expiring at our annual meeting in 2021. 
Nominees for director at the annual meeting are Linden R. Evans, Robert P. Otto, Mark A. Schober and Thomas J. Zeller. Our Bylaws require a minimum of nine directors. The Board has set the size of the current board at 10 directors. If, at the time of the meeting, any of such nominees are unable to stand for election, the Board of Directors may designate a substitute or reduce the number of directors to nine. In that case, shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute director. We do not expect that any nominee will be unavailable or unable to serve.
Pursuant to our Bylaws, directors must resign from the Board at the annual meeting following attaining 72 years of age.  Accordingly, we expect Mr. Zeller, who will turn 72 in the next year, to resign effective at our annual meeting in 2020 and therefore serve only one year of his term.
The Board and the Governance Committee believe that the combination of the various qualifications, skills and experiences of the directors contribute to an effective and well-functioning Board, and that, individually and as a whole, the directors possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the business and quality advice to the Company's management. Included in each director's biography below is an assessment of the specific qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that have led to the conclusion that each individual should serve as a director in light of our current business and structure.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of the following nominees:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines titled "Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Board of Directors," which guide the operation of our Board and assist the Board in fulfilling its obligations to shareholders and other constituencies. The guidelines lay the foundation for the Board's responsibilities, operations, leadership, organization and committee matters. The Governance Committee reviews the guidelines annually, and the guidelines may be amended at any time, upon recommendation by the Governance Committee and approval of the Board. These guidelines can be found in the "Governance" section of our website (www.blackhillscorp.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance).
Board Independence 
In accordance with NYSE rules, the Board of Directors through its Governance Committee affirmatively determines the independence of each director and director nominee in accordance with guidelines it has adopted, which include all elements of independence set forth in the NYSE listing standards. These guidelines are contained in our Policy for Director Independence, which can be found in the "Governance" section of our website (www.blackhillscorp.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance). Based on these standards, the Governance Committee determined that each of the following non-employee directors is independent and has no relationship with us, except as a director and shareholder:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Michael H. Madison 80% INDEPENDENT  Mark A. Schober 
Michael H. Madison 80% INDEPENDENT  Mark A. Schober 
Steven R. Mills Teresa A. Taylor 
Robert P. Otto John B. Vering 
Rebecca B. Roberts Thomas J. Zeller 
[END TABLE]
In addition, based on such standards, the Governance Committee determined that Messers. Emery and Evans are not independent because they are Officers of the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure
As part of a planned leadership transition, Mr. Emery, after 14 years as Chairman and CEO, was appointed Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Evans, who has been President and Chief Operating Officer since 2016, was named President and CEO effective January 1, 2019. To ensure a seamless transition of our CEO role, Mr. Emery collaborates closely with our new CEO on corporate strategy and other items. 
Our Board has and continues to value a high degree of Board independence. As a result, our corporate governance structure and practices promote a strong, independent Board and include several independent oversight mechanisms. Only independent directors serve on our Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees. Our Board believes these practices ensure that experienced and independent directors will continue to effectively oversee management and critical issues related to financial and operating plans, long-range strategic issues, enterprise risk and corporate integrity. All of our Board committees may seek legal, financial or other expert advice from a source independent of management.
As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Board of Directors, because our Executive Chairman is not independent, our Board annually appoints an independent Lead Director. John B. Vering is our current Lead Director and has served in this role since March 2016. As provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the primary responsibilities of the Lead Director are to chair executive sessions of the independent directors, and in conjunction with the Executive Chairman, communicate the Board's annual evaluation of the CEO. The Lead Director, together with the independent directors, establishes the agenda for executive sessions, which are held at each regular Board meeting. The Lead Director serves as a liaison between the independent members of the Board, the Executive Chairman, and the CEO, as appropriate, and discusses, to the extent appropriate, matters raised by the independent directors in executive session. The Lead Director also consults with the Executive Chairman, and the CEO, as appropriate, regarding meeting agendas and presides over regular meetings of the Board in the absence of the Executive Chairman. This leadership structure provides consistent and effective oversight of our management and our Company. Risk Oversight 
Our Board oversees an enterprise approach to risk management that supports our operational and strategic objectives. The Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Board of Directors provide that the Board will review major risks facing our Company and the options for risk mitigation presented by management. Our Board delegates oversight of certain risk considerations to its committees within each of their respective areas of responsibility; however, the full Board monitors risk relating to strategic planning and execution, as well as executive succession. Financial risk oversight falls within the purview of our Audit Committee. Our Compensation Committee oversees compensation and benefit plan risks. Each committee reports to the full Board.
Our Board reviews any material changes in our key enterprise risk management ("ERM") issues, including cyber security, with management at each quarterly Board meeting. In addition, the Board reviews a deep dive enterprise risk topic with our Chief Risk Officer at most quarterly meetings. In so doing, our Board seeks to ensure appropriate risk mitigation strategies are implemented by management on an ongoing basis. Operational and strategic plan presentations by management to our Board include consideration of the challenges and risks to our business. Our Board and management actively engage in discussions of these topics and utilize outside consultants as needed. Our Board oversees the assessment of our strategic plan risks as part of our strategic planning process. In addition, our Board periodically receives safety performance, operations, environmental, legal and compliance reports.
Our Audit Committee oversees management's strategy and performance relative to our significant financial risks. In consultation with management, the independent auditors and the internal auditors, the Audit Committee discusses our risk assessment, risk management and credit policies and reviews significant financial risk exposures, along with steps management has taken to monitor, mitigate and report such exposures. At least twice a year, our Chief Risk Officer provides a Risk Report and the Treasurer provides a Credit Report to the Audit Committee. We adopted a Credit Policy that establishes guidelines, controls and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within established risk tolerances.
Our Compensation Committee adopted an executive compensation philosophy that provides the foundation for our executive compensation program. The executive compensation philosophy states that the executive pay program should be market-based and maintain an appropriate and competitive balance between fixed and variable pay elements, short-term and long-term compensation and cash and stock-based compensation. The Compensation Committee establishes company-specific performance goals with potential incentive payouts for our executive officers to motivate and reward performance, consistent with our long-term success. The target compensation for our senior officers is weighted in favor of long-term incentives, aligning performance incentives with long-term results for our shareholders. Our Compensation Committee also sets minimum performance thresholds and maximum payouts in the incentive programs and maintains the discretion to reduce awards if excessive risk is taken. Stock ownership guidelines established for all of our officers require our executives to hold 100 percent of all shares awarded to them (net of share withholding for taxes and, in the case of cashless stock option exercises, net of the exercise price and withholding for taxes) until the established stock ownership guidelines are achieved. Our Compensation Committee also includes "clawback" provisions in our incentive plans, which may require an executive to return incentives received, if the Compensation Committee determines, in its discretion, that the executive engaged in specified misconduct or wrongdoing or in the event of certain financial restatements.
In addition, management periodically conducts and our Compensation Committee reviews a risk assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees. This was last done in December 2017 and there have been no material changes in our policies and practices since that time. Key members of human resources, legal, risk, finance, audit and operations departments were included in the review to ensure accuracy and completeness of the scope and findings. The assessment demonstrated that our compensation programs are designed to minimize financial and reputational risks and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Our management is responsible for day-to-day risk management and operates under an ERM program that addresses strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks. The ERM program includes practices to identify risks, assesses the impact and probability of occurrence, and develops action plans to prevent the occurrence or mitigate the impact of the risk. The ERM program includes regular reporting to our senior management team and includes monitoring and testing by the Chief Risk Officer and Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit groups. The Chief Risk Officer reviews the overall ERM program with the Board of Directors on a regular basis.
We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing our Company. Director Nominees 
The Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. The Governance Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. In the event vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Governance Committee considers various potential candidates for director. Board candidates are considered based upon various criteria, including diverse business, administrative and professional skills or experiences; an understanding of relevant industries, technologies and markets; financial literacy; independence status; the ability and willingness to contribute time and special competence to Board activities; personal integrity and independent judgment; and a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The Governance Committee considers these and other factors as it deems appropriate, given the needs of the Board. Our goal is a balanced and diverse Board, with members whose skills, background and experience are complementary and, together, cover the spectrum of areas that impact our business currently and in the future. The Governance Committee considers candidates for Board membership suggested by a variety of sources, including current or past Board members, the use of third-party executive search firms, members of management and shareholders. Any shareholder may make recommendations for consideration by the Governance Committee for membership on the Board by sending a written statement of the qualifications of the recommended individual to the Corporate Secretary. There are no differences in the manner by which the Committee evaluates director candidates recommended by shareholders from those recommended by other sources.
Shareholders who intend to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors must provide timely written notice of the nomination in accordance with Article I, Section 9 of our Bylaws. Generally, our Corporate Secretary must receive the written notice at our executive offices at 7001 Mount Rushmore Road, P.O. Box 1400, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. For the 2020 shareholder meeting, those dates are January 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020. The notice must set forth at a minimum the information set forth in Article I, Section 9 of our Bylaws, including the shareholder's identity and status, contingent ownership interests, description of any agreement made with others acting in concert with respect to the nomination, specific information about the nominee and certain representations by the nominee to us.
Communications with the Board 
Shareholders and others interested in communicating directly with the Lead Director, with the independent directors as a group, or the Board of Directors may do so in writing to the Lead Director, Black Hills Corporation, 7001 Mount Rushmore Road, P.O. Box 1400, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709.
Corporate Governance Documents 
The charters of the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees, as well as the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Board of Directors, Policy for Director Independence, Code of Business Conduct and the Code of Ethics that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller, and certain other persons performing similar functions can be found in the "Governance" section of our website (www.blackhillscorp.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance). We intend to disclose any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics on our website. Please note that none of the information contained on our website is incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.
The Corporate Governance Guidelines include a plurality plus voting policy. Pursuant to the policy, any nominee for election as a director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "Withheld" from his or her election than votes "For" his or her election will promptly tender his or her resignation as a director to the Chairman of the Board following certification of the election results. Broker non-votes will not be deemed to be votes "For" or "Withheld" from a director's election for purposes of the policy. The Governance Committee (without the participation of the affected director) will consider each resignation tendered under the policy and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it. The Board will then take the appropriate action on each tendered resignation, taking into account the Governance Committee's recommendation. The Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate, including the reasons why the Governance Committee believes shareholders "Withheld" votes for election from such director and any other circumstances surrounding the "Withheld" votes, any alternatives for curing the underlying cause of the "Withheld" votes, the qualifications of the tendering director, his or her past and expected future contributions to us and the Board, and the overall composition of the Board, including whether accepting the resignation would cause us to fail to meet any applicable SEC or NYSE requirements. The Board will publicly disclose by filing with the SEC on Form 8-K its decision and, if applicable, its rationale within 90 days after receipt of the tendered resignation. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
We recognize related party transactions can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of us and our shareholders. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is our preference to avoid related party transactions. Nevertheless, we recognize that there are situations where related party transactions may be in, or may not be inconsistent with, the best interests of us and our shareholders, including but not limited to situations where we may obtain products or services of a nature, quantity or quality, or on other terms, that are not readily available from alternative sources or when we provide products or services to related parties on an arm's length basis on terms comparable to those provided to unrelated third parties or on terms comparable to those provided to employees generally. Therefore, our Board of Directors has adopted a policy for the review of related party transactions. This policy requires directors and officers to promptly report to our General Counsel all proposed or existing transactions in which the Company and they, or persons related to them, are parties or participants. Our General Counsel presents to our Governance Committee those transactions that may require disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K (typically, those transactions that exceed $120,000). Our Governance Committee reviews the material facts presented and either approves or disapproves entry into the transaction. In reviewing the transaction, the Governance Committee considers the following factors, among other factors it deems appropriate: (i) whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances; (ii) the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction; and (iii) the impact on a director's independence in the event the related party is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Based solely upon a review of our records and copies of reports on Form 3, 4 and 5 furnished to us, we believe that during and with respect to 2018, all persons subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, filed the required reports on a timely basis, except for a Form 4 for Jennifer C. Landis, Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer, reporting the acquisition of 127 shares through the vesting of a restricted stock grant in the month of February 2017.  
MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Our directors review and approve our strategic plan and oversee our management. Our Board of Directors held four in-person meetings and three telephonic meetings during 2018. Each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board includes an executive session of only independent directors. We encourage our directors to attend the annual shareholders' meeting. During 2018, each current director attended at least 75 percent of the combined total of Board meetings and Committee meetings on which the director served and all directors then serving attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
Our Board has three standing committees to facilitate and assist the Board in the execution of its responsibilities. The committees are currently the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee. In accordance with the NYSE listing standards and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees are comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter, which is available on our website at www.blackhillscorp.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance and is also available in print to any shareholder who requests it. In addition, our Board creates special committees from time to time for specific purposes. Members of the committees are designated by our Board upon recommendation of the Governance Committee.

The Compensation Committee concluded that Willis Towers Watson is independent and Willis Towers Watson's performance of services raises no conflict of interest. The Committee's conclusion was based in part on a report that Willis Towers Watson provided to the Committee intended to reveal any potential conflicts of interest and a schedule provided by management of the type and amount of non-executive compensation services provided by Willis Towers Watson to the Company. During 2018, the cost of these non-executive compensation services was less than $25,000.
The Committee annually evaluates the CEO's performance against Board-established goals and objectives, with input from the other independent directors. Based upon the Committee's evaluation and recommendation, the independent directors of the Board set the CEO's annual compensation, including salary, bonus, incentive and equity compensation.
The CEO annually reviews the performance of each of our executive officers and presents a summary of his evaluations to the Committee. Based upon these performance reviews, market analysis conducted by the compensation consultant and discussions with our Sr. Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, the CEO recommends the compensation of the executive officers to the Committee. The Committee may exercise its discretion in modifying any of the recommended compensation and award levels in its review and approval process. 
More information describing the Compensation Committee's processes and procedures for considering and determining executive compensation, including the role of our CEO and consultants in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation, is included in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. In setting non-employee director compensation, the Compensation Committee recommends the form and amount of compensation to the Board of Directors, which makes the final determination. In considering and recommending the compensation of non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee considers such factors as it deems appropriate, including historical compensation information, level of compensation necessary to attract and retain non-employee directors meeting our desired qualifications and market data. In the review of director compensation in 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Willis Towers Watson to provide market information on non-employee director compensation, including compensation structure, annual board and committee retainers, committee chair fees, and stock-based compensation.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors. In addition, none of our executive officers serve as a member of a board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve on our Board or on our Compensation Committee.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
DIRECTOR FEES
Compensation to our non-employee directors consists of cash retainers for Board members, Committee members, the Lead Director and Committee Chairs.  In addition, the Board members receive common stock equivalents that are deferred until after they leave the Board.  Dividend equivalents accrue on the common stock equivalents. We do not pay meeting fees.
In 2018, Willis Towers Watson completed a market compensation review of our peer companies' director fees. Based on this review, the cash retainer, the equity component of the directors' fees, and the Audit Committee Chair retainer fee were increased  effective January 1, 2019 to more closely align with the median director compensation for our peer utility companies. The fee structure for director fees in 2018 and the new fees effective January 1, 2019 are as follows:

 PAY FOR PERFORMANCE
A key component of our executive compensation program is to link pay to performance. 
The charts below illustrate the directional relationship between the compensation of our CEO as reported in the Summary Compensation Table (excluding the change in pension value) and the growth in our Company for the last five years.
Since a large percentage of the CEO's pay as reported in the Summary Compensation Table represents potential pay, we believe it is also important to look at pay actually realized each year. In addition, since over 50 percent of our CEO pay is tied to Company performance, it is important to look at his realized pay as it is impacted by Company performance.  The following graphics show reported pay and realized pay over the last five years and realized pay as it correlates to the Company's annualized 3-year total shareholder return, its long-term performance metric.
Reported pay includes base salary, actual annual incentive earned, the grant date fair value of long-term equity compensation and all other compensation, excluding the change in pension value, each as reported in the Summary Compensation Table.
Realized pay includes base salary, actual annual incentive earned and all other compensation, each as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, and the value of long-term performance compensation paid and stock awards vested in the applicable year. KEY EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND  2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS
Overall, our goal is to target total direct compensation (the sum of base salary, short-term incentive at target and long-term incentive at target) at the median of the appropriate market when our operating results approximate average performance in relation to our peers.
Our executive compensation is designed to maintain an appropriate and competitive balance between fixed and variable compensation components, short- and long-term compensation, and cash and stock-based compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Variable 77%   Variable 63% 
Linked to Share Value 52%   Linked to Share Value 42% 
[END TABLE]
We believe that the performance basis for determining compensation should differ by each reward component – base salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentive. Incentive measures (short-term and long-term) should emphasize objective, quantitative operating measures. The performance measures for our incentive compensation plans are as follows:
Base Salary
Our CEO recommended, and our Board concurred, that our Named Executive Officers not receive base salary merit increases in 2018 due to poor stock performance and other challenges in 2017. The competitive market assessment also indicated base salaries were generally aligned with the utility industry median. The individual base salaries reflect the individual's performance, tenure, experience and market compensation for comparable positions in our industry and Compensation Peer Group.  
Short-Term Incentive 
The short-term incentive is based on earnings per share targets. The Committee believes that this performance measure closely aligns the executives' and our shareholders' interests and fosters teamwork and cooperation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
* The 2018 short-term target incentive as a percent of base pay remained the same as the prior year at 110 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent and 50 percent for our CEO, CFO, COO, and CIO, respectively. It was increased for our GC from 45 percent to 55 percent, adjusting to approximate the market median. 
* Based on the attainment of pre-established performance goals, the actual payout can range from 50 percent to  200 percent of target. 
* The Committee selected an earnings per share goal based on ongoing operations, as adjusted, of $3.43 as the 2018 corporate target goal.  
* Our 2018 earnings for the Short-Term Incentive Plan were $3.54 per share, which was 3 percent above our target earnings per share goal, resulting in a payout of 133 percent of target. 
[END TABLE]
 Long-Term Incentive 
The long-term incentive is delivered 50 percent in performance shares and 50 percent in restricted stock that vests ratably over a three-year service period. Performance share awards are based on our total shareholder return over a three-year performance period compared to our Performance Peer Group. This performance measure was chosen because it mirrors the market return of our shareholders and compares our performance to that of our Performance Peer Group. Target payout occurs if our performance is at the 50th percentile of our Performance Peer Group. 
*2018 Long-Term Incentive Value
The 2018 long-term target incentive stayed the same for the CEO and was adjusted for all the Named Executive Officers reflecting the market median compensation levels.
*Performance Share Plan Payment
Our total shareholder return under the performance plan criteria for the three-year period, January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, was 62 percent, which ranked at the 75th percentile of our Performance Peer Group resulting in a 162 percent payout. 
*Restricted Stock Grant
Consistent with prior years, the Committee awarded 50 percent of the Named Executive Officers' long-term incentive in restricted stock that ratably vests over three years.
Governance Best Practices
We have several governance programs in place to align our executive compensation with shareholder interests and to mitigate risks in our plans. These programs include stock ownership guidelines, clawback provisions in our short-term and long-term incentive award agreements, and the prohibition of hedging or pledging of Company stock.
Summary
In total, the Committee believes that the 2018 compensation actions, decisions and outcomes strongly reflect and reinforce our compensation philosophy and, in particular, emphasize the alignment between compensation and both performance and shareholder interests. At our 2018 annual meeting, shareholders owning 96 percent of the shares voted on this matter approved our executive compensation for 2017, which we consider highly supportive of our current compensation philosophy. In connection with establishing the 2018 executive compensation program, the Board reviewed the results of the say on pay vote, as well as market data and performance indicators. No significant design changes were made.
SETTING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Based upon our compensation philosophy, the Committee structures our executive compensation to motivate our officers to achieve specified business goals and to reward them for achieving such goals. The key steps the Committee follows in setting executive compensation are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Analyze executive compensation market data to ensure market competitiveness 
Review the components of executive compensation, including base salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentive, retirement and other benefits 
Review total compensation mix and structure 
Review executive officer performance, responsibilities, experience and other factors cited above to determine individual compensation levels 
[END TABLE]
 Market Compensation Analysis
The market for our senior executive talent is national in scope and is not focused on any one geographic location, area or region of the country. As such, our executive compensation should be competitive with the national market for senior executives. It should also reflect the executive's responsibilities and duties and align with the compensation of executives at companies or business units of comparable size and complexity. The Committee gathers market information for our corporate executives from the electric and gas utility industry and also reviews general industry data as an additional reference.
The Committee selects and retains the services of an independent consulting firm to periodically:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Provide information regarding practices and trends in compensation programs 
Review and evaluate our compensation program as compared to compensation practices of other companies with similar characteristics, including size, complexity and type of business 
Review and assist with the establishment of a peer group of companies 
Provide a compensation analysis of the executive positions 
[END TABLE]
The Committee used the services of Willis Towers Watson to evaluate 2018 compensation. Willis Towers Watson gathered data from nationally recognized survey providers, as well as specific peer companies through public filings, which included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
i. Willis Towers Watson's 2017 Compensation Data Bank (energy services and general industry); and ii. 24 peer companies representing the utility and energy industry. 
[END TABLE]
The 24 peer companies ranged in annual revenue size from approximately $545 million to $6.4 billion, with the median at $1.9 billion. The Company's 2017 revenue was $1.7 billion. The survey data was adjusted for our relative revenue size using regression analysis. Our compensation peer companies included in the analysis for 2018 compensation decisions were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
ALLETE Inc. Hawaiian Electric Ind., Inc. ONE Gas, Inc. 
Alliant Energy Corporation IDACORP Inc. Pinnacle West Capital Corp. 
Ameren Corporation MGE Energy Inc. PNM Resources, Inc. 
Atmos Energy Corp. New Jersey Resources Corp. Portland General Electric Co. 
Avista Corp. NiSource, Inc. Scana Corp. 
CMS Energy Corp. Northwest Natural Gas Co. South Jersey Industries, Inc. 
El Paso Electric Co. NorthWestern Corp. Spire, Inc. 
Great Plains Energy, Inc. OGE Energy Corp. Vectren Corp. 
[END TABLE]
The above peer companies were chosen by the Compensation Committee as the Compensation Peer Group after engaging Willis Towers Watson to do an extensive review. Approximately 75 percent of the above companies are a subset of the EEI Index, our Performance Peer Group, and were chosen because they were within our revenue range of 0.4x - 2.5x our size and market capitalization range of 0.25x - 4.0x our size. The EEI Index is comprised of pure electric utilities and combination gas and electric utilities. In addition, approximately 25 percent of the peer companies above were added to provide a mix of pure gas utilities.
The salary surveys are one of several factors the Committee uses in setting appropriate compensation levels. Other factors include Company performance, individual performance and experience, the level and nature of the executive's responsibilities, internal equity considerations and discussions with the CEO related to the other senior executive officers. Components of Executive Compensation
The components of our executive compensation program consist of a base salary, a short-term incentive plan, and long-term incentives. In addition, we provide retirement and other benefits.
An important component of the executives' total compensation is derived from incentive compensation. Incentive compensation is intended to motivate and encourage our executives to drive performance and achieve superior results for our shareholders. The Committee periodically reviews information provided by the compensation consultant to determine the appropriate level and mix of incentive compensation. Actual income in the form of incentive compensation is realized by the  executive as a result of achieving Company goals and overall stock performance. The Committee believes that a significant portion of total target compensation should be comprised of incentive compensation. In order to reward long-term growth while still encouraging short-term results, the Committee establishes incentive targets that emphasize long-term compensation at a greater level than short-term compensation.
The Committee annually reviews all components of each senior executive officer's compensation, including salary, short-term incentive, equity and other long-term incentive compensation values granted, and the current and potential value of the executive officer's total Black Hills Corporation equity holdings. 
Base Salary. Base salaries for all officers are reviewed annually. We also adjust the base salary of our executives at the time of a promotion or change in job responsibility, as appropriate. Evaluation of 2018 base salary adjustments occurred in January 2018. The base salary component of each position was compared to the median of the market data provided by the compensation consultant. The market data indicated the salaries generally aligned with the utility industry median and below comparable general industry levels. The actual base salary of each officer was determined by the executive's performance, the experience level of the officer, the executive's current position in a market-based salary range, and internal pay relationships. Our CEO recommended, and our Board concurred, that our named executive officers not receive base salary merit increases in 2018 due to poor stock performance and other challenges in 2017.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2017 Base Salary 2018 Base Salary 
Emery, CEO $820,000 $820,000 
Kinzley, CFO $381,000 $381,000 
Evans, COO $530,000 $530,000 
Iverson, GC $350,000 $350,000 
Buchholz, CIO $320,000 $320,000 
[END TABLE]
Short-Term Incentive. Our Short-Term Incentive Plan is designed to recognize and reward the contributions of individual executives as well as the contributions that group performance makes to overall corporate success. The program's goal for our corporate officers is based on an earnings per share target in order to closely align interests with shareholders and to foster teamwork and cooperation within the officer team. The short-term incentive, after applicable tax withholding, is distributed to the officer in the form of 50 percent stock and 50 percent cash, unless the officer has met his or her stock ownership guideline, in which case he or she may elect to receive the total award in cash, after deductions and applicable tax withholding. Target award levels are established as a percentage of each participant's base salary. A target award is typically comparable to the average short-term incentive target award of the Performance Peer Group at the 50th percentile level. The actual payout will vary, based on attainment of pre-established performance goals, between 50 and 200 percent of the individual executive's short-term incentive target award level.
The Committee approves the target level for each officer in January, which applies to performance in the upcoming plan year. Target levels are derived in part from competitive data provided by the compensation consultant and in part by the Committee's judgment regarding internal equity, retention and an individual executive's expected contribution to the achievement of our strategic objectives. The target levels for the positions held by our Named Executive Officers are shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Short-Term Incentive Target 
  2017 2018% Amount $ Amount% Amount $ Amount 
Emery, CEO 110% $902,000 110% $902,000

Buchholz, CIO 50% $160,000 50% $160,000 
[END TABLE]
The threshold, target and maximum payout levels for our Named Executive Officers under the 2018 Short-Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Grants of Plan Based Awards in 2018 table on page 40, under the heading "Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards."
Early in the first quarter, the Committee meets to establish the goals for the current plan year, to evaluate actual performance in relation to the prior year's targets and to approve the actual payment of awards related to the prior plan year. The Committee reserves the discretion to adjust any award, and will review and take into account individual performance, level of contribution, and the accomplishment of specific project goals that were initiated throughout the plan year.
The Committee selected an earnings per share goal based on ongoing operations, as adjusted, for 2018. This meets the objectives of the plan, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Aligns the interests of the plan participants and the shareholders with a corporate-wide component 
Motivates employees and supports the corporate compensation philosophy 
Provides an incentive reflective of core operating performance by adjusting for unique one-time events 
Ensures "buy-in" from participants with easily understood metrics 
Meets the performance objectives of the plan to achieve over-time, an average payout equal to market competitive levels 
[END TABLE]
The Committee has defined earnings per share from ongoing operations, as adjusted, to be GAAP earnings per share adjusted for unique one-time non-budgeted events (similar to those items adjusted for when reporting non-GAAP earnings for external purposes), including external acquisition costs, impairments, transaction financing costs, unique tax transactions, and other items the Committee deems not reflective of ongoing operations and the value created for shareholders. 
The Committee approved the goals for 2018 for the corporate officers as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Threshold    Earnings Per Share from Ongoing Operations, as Adjusted   Payout% of Target 
Minimum   $3.09   50% 
Target   $3.43   100% 
Maximum   $3.77   200% 
[END TABLE]
 On February 8, 2019, the Committee approved a payout of 133 percent of target under the 2018 Short-Term Incentive Plan based on the attainment of $3.54 earnings per share from ongoing operations, as adjusted, for incentive plan purposes. Earnings from ongoing operations, as adjusted, for incentive plan purposes were the same as earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, reported externally to our investors (and reconciled to GAAP earnings per share in Appendix A).  For 2018, actual adjustments included tax benefits related to legal entity restructuring at our gas utilities and Tax Cuts and Jobs Act related tax adjustments.
Payouts under the Short-Term Incentive Plan have varied over the last 10 years as shown in the graph below.
Actual awards made to each of our Named Executive Officers under the Short-Term Incentive Plan for 2018 are included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 38.
Long-Term Incentive. Long-term incentive compensation is comprised of grants made by the Committee under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Long-term incentive compensation is intended to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Promote corporate goals by linking the personal interests of participants to those of our shareholders 
Provide participants with an incentive for excellence in individual performance 
Promote teamwork among participants 
Motivate, retain, and attract the services of participants who make significant contributions to our success by allowing participants to share in such success 
Meet the performance objectives of the plan to achieve over-time, an average payout equal to market competitive levels 
[END TABLE]
The Committee oversees the administration of the Omnibus Incentive Plans with full power and authority to determine when and to whom awards will be granted, along with the type, amount and other terms and conditions of each award. The long-term incentive compensation component is currently composed of performance shares and restricted stock. The Committee chose these components because linking executive compensation to stock price appreciation and total shareholder return is an effective way to align the interests of management with those of our shareholders. The Committee selected total shareholder return as the performance goal for the performance shares because it believes executive pay under a long-term, capital accumulation program should mirror our performance in shareholder return as compared to our Performance Peer Group of companies. The value of long-term incentives awarded is based primarily on competitive market-based data presented by the compensation consultant to the Committee, the impact each position has on our shareholder return and internal pay relationships. The actual amount realized will vary from the awarded target amounts. The Committee approved the target long-term incentive compensation level for each officer in January 2018.

[END TABLE]
The variance in percentage of base salary for the long-term incentive value of our Named Executive Officers reflects our philosophy that certain officers should have more of their total compensation at risk because they hold positions that have a greater impact on our long-term results and is also consistent with market practice.
Performance shares are used to deliver 50 percent of the long-term incentive award amounts, with the remaining 50 percent delivered in the form of restricted stock. The actual shares of performance shares and restricted stock granted in 2018 are reflected in the tables in the Performance Shares and Restricted Stock sections that follow.
Performance Shares. Participants are awarded a target number of performance shares based upon the value of the individual performance share component approved by the Committee, divided by the Beginning Stock Price. The Beginning Stock Price is the average of the closing price of our common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the beginning of the plan period. Entitlement to performance shares is based on our total shareholder return over designated performance periods, as measured against our Performance Peer Group. The final value of the performance shares is based upon the number of shares of common stock that are ultimately granted, based upon our performance in relation to the performance criteria.
The Committee, with the guidance of Willis Towers Watson, periodically conducts a review of the market competitiveness of our performance share plans. A summary of the performance criteria for each plan period is summarized in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Share Plans 
Percentile Ranking for Threshold Payout of 25% of Target Shares Percentile Ranking for Target Payout of 100% of Target Shares Percentile Ranking for Maximum  Payout Level Possible Payout Range of Target 
25th percentile 50th percentile 90th percentile 0-200% 
[END TABLE]
In addition, beginning with the 2017-2019 performance plan, our plans provide: (i) a threshold payout if relative TSR performance is below threshold but at 35 percent or higher; and (ii) the performance share plan payout is capped at 100 percent of target if TSR is negative. The additional provisions are intended to reduce the impact of one peer company's performance on the relative TSR plan, and also increase accountability and expectations related to the Company's performance.  The performance awards and dividend equivalents, if earned, are paid 50 percent in cash and 50 percent in common stock. All payroll deductions and applicable tax withholding related to the award are withheld from the cash portion. Performance share target grant values for new performance periods are approved in January of each year.
The Committee, with the guidance of Willis Towers Watson, periodically conducts a review of our Performance Peer Group to which we should be compared. Due to the extensive merger and acquisition activity in the industry and its contribution to relative performance volatility, the Committee chose to use the companies in the Edison Electric Index as the Performance Peer Group for financial performance tracking beginning with the 2017-2019 performance period. 
Payouts under the Performance Share Plan have varied significantly over the last 10 years with either no payout or very high payouts, as shown in the graph below.
Each performance share period extends for three years. For the recently completed performance period, January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, our total shareholder return was 62 percent, which ranked at the 75th percentile of our Performance Peer Group, resulting in a payout at 162 percent of target.
Target shares for each of our Named Executive Officers for the outstanding performance periods are as follows:

Performance Evaluation
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions. The CEO annually reviews the performance of each of our executive officers. Based upon these performance reviews, market analysis conducted by compensation consultants and discussions with our Senior Vice President - Chief Human Resources Officer, the CEO recommends the compensation for this group of officers to the Committee.
Role of the Committee and Board in Setting Executive Compensation. The Committee reviews and establishes the Company's financial targets and the CEO's goals and objectives for the year. After the end of each year, the Committee evaluates the CEO's performance in light of established goals and objectives, with input from the other independent directors. Based upon the Committee's evaluation and recommendation, the independent directors of the Board set the CEO's annual compensation, including salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentive and equity compensation.
The Committee reviews the CEO's recommended compensation levels for our senior officers. The Committee may approve the CEO's compensation recommendations for this group of officers or exercise its discretion in modifying any of the recommended compensation and award levels in its review and approval process. The Committee is required to approve all decisions regarding equity awards to our officers.
Compensation Arrangements Regarding Chief Executive Officer Transition 
Effective December 31, 2018, Mr. Emery retired as Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Evans was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2019. Mr. Emery continues to serve the Company as Executive Chairman until May 1, 2020. This leadership change was the result of a comprehensive, multi-year, board-led succession planning process.
The Compensation Committee engaged its compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, to conduct an extensive study on market compensation for an incoming Chief Executive Officer and the transition role of an Executive Chairman. The compensation consultant provided the Committee a Chief Executive Officer benchmarking report that regressed the proxy data of our Compensation Peer Group. The compensation consultant also advised the Committee that pay for a new Chief Executive Officer normally starts at the lower end of the competitive range and increases to the middle of the range within a few years, depending on performance and experience; and Executive Chairman compensation should take into account the change in roles and responsibilities and the level of support expected to be provided to the new Chief Executive Officer, while also maintaining stability and consistency at the board level during the transition. The Committee recommended and the Board approved the following compensation packages, effective January 1, 2019:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As Executive Chairman, Mr. Emery will receive an annual salary equal to $1,300,000 in 2019, decreasing to an annual salary equal to $480,000, effective January 1, 2020 ($160,000 for the service period of January 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020).  In addition, he will continue to receive all full-time employee and officer benefits and perquisites until his retirement as Executive Chairman on May 1, 2020.  However, he will no longer participate in the Company's Short-Term Incentive Plan or receive new awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Emery's stock ownership requirement will be a fixed number of shares in an amount that is substantially similar to when he was our Chairman and CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Evans base salary will be $750,000. In addition, Mr. Evans will be eligible to receive an annual incentive based on 100 percent of his base salary in 2019 in accordance with the Company's Short-Term Incentive Plan and $1,500,000 of target award value pursuant to the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan.  These compensation actions result in a total target direct compensation level of $3,000,000 for Mr. Evans which is 91 percent of the market median. 
[END TABLE]
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
The Committee has implemented stock ownership guidelines that apply to all officers based upon their level of responsibility. We believe it is important for our officers to hold a significant amount of our common stock to further align their performance with the interest of our shareholders. A "retention ratio" approach to stock ownership is incorporated into the guidelines.  Officers are required to retain 100 percent of all shares owned, including shares awarded through our incentive plans (net of share withholding for taxes and, in the case of cashless stock option exercises, net of the exercise price and withholding for taxes) until specific ownership goals are achieved. 
The guidelines are shown below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Stock Ownership Value as 
Position   Multiple of Base Salary 
CEO   6X 
COO and CFO   4X 
Other Senior Officers   3X 
[END TABLE]
At least annually, the Compensation Committee reviews common stock ownership to confirm the officers have met or are progressing toward their stock ownership guidelines. Generally, an officer may not sell common stock unless he or she owns common stock in excess of 110 percent of the applicable stock ownership guideline. All of our Named Executive Officers have exceeded their stock ownership guidelines.
HEDGING POLICY
Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from hedging and pledging our stock or holding our stock in a margin account.
2018 BENEFITS
Retirement Benefits. We maintain a variety of employee benefit plans and programs in which our executive officers may participate. We believe it is important to provide post-employment benefits to our executive officers and the benefits we provide approximate retirement benefits paid by other employers to executives in similar positions. The Committee periodically reviews the benefits provided, with assistance from its compensation consultant, to maintain a market-based benefits package. None of our Named Executive Officers received any pension benefit payments in 2018.
Several years ago, we adopted a defined contribution plan design as our primary retirement plan and amended our Defined Benefit Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") for all eligible employees to incorporate a partial freeze in which the accrual of benefits ceased for certain participants while other participants were allowed an election to continue to accrue benefits. Messrs. Emery and Buchholz are our only Named Executive Officers who met the age and service requirement allowing them to continue to accrue benefits under the Pension Plan. Employees who no longer accrue benefits under the Pension Plan now receive Company Retirement Contributions ("Retirement Contributions") in the Retirement Savings Plan. The Retirement Contributions are an age and service points-based calculation.
The 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan is offered to all our eligible employees and we provide matching contributions for certain eligible participants. All of our Named Executive Officers are participants in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan and received matching contributions in 2018. The matching contributions and the Retirement Contributions are included as "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table on page 38. We also provide nonqualified plans to certain officers because of Internal Revenue Code limitations imposed on the qualified plans. The level of retirement benefits provided by the Pension Plan and Nonqualified Plans for each of our Named Executive Officers is reflected in the Pension Benefits for 2018 table on page 44. Our contributions to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan are included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 38 and the aggregate Nonqualified Deferred Compensation balance at December 31, 2018 is reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018 table on page 47. These retirement benefits are explained in more detail in the accompanying narrative to the tables.
Other Personal Benefits. We provide the personal use of a Company vehicle, executive health services, and limited reimbursement of financial planning services as benefits to our executive officers and use of the corporate aircraft to go to outside board meetings for the CEO. The specific amount attributable to these benefits in 2018 is disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 38. The Committee periodically reviews the other personal benefits provided to our executive officers and believes the current benefits are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program.
CHANGE IN CONTROL PAYMENTS
Our Named Executive Officers may also receive severance benefits in the event of a change in control. We have no employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers. However, change in control agreements are common among our Compensation Peer Group and the Committee and our Board of Directors believe providing these agreements to our corporate officers protects our shareholder interests in the event of a change in control by helping assure management focus and continuity. Our change in control agreements have expiration dates and our Board of Directors conducts a thorough review of the change in control agreements at each renewal period. Our current change in control agreements expire November 15, 2019. In general, our change in control agreements provide a severance payment of up to 2.99 times average compensation for Mr. Emery, and up to two times average compensation for the other Named Executive Officers. The change in control agreements do not provide for excise tax gross-ups and contain a "double trigger," providing benefits in association with:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) a change in control, and 
(2) (i) a termination of employment other than by death, disability or by us for cause, or 
  (ii) a termination by the employee for good reason. 
[END TABLE]
See the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control table on page 49 and the accompanying narrative for more information regarding our change in control agreements and estimated payments associated with a change in control.
TAX AND ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS
Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits the tax deductibility by a corporation of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain of its officers. Section 162(m) as in effect prior to the enactment of tax reform legislation in December 2017 generally disallowed a tax deduction to public companies for compensation of more than $1 million paid in any taxable year to each "covered employee," consisting of the CEO and the three other highest paid executive officers employed at the end of the year (other than the CFO). Performance-based compensation was exempt from this deduction limitation if the Company met specified requirements set forth in the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.  
For years beginning January 1, 2018, there is no exception from the deduction limit under Section 162(m) for performance based compensation unless it qualifies for transitional relief applicable to certain binding, written performance-based compensation arrangements that were in place as of November 2, 2017, and were not materially modified after that date. In addition, "covered employees" also include any person who served as CEO or CFO at any time during a taxable year, as well as any person who was ever identified as a covered employee in 2017 or any subsequent year. The Committee continues to believe that shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in structuring and awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some past and/or future compensation awards result in non-deductible compensation expenses to the Company. The Committee's ability to continue to provide a competitive compensation package to attract, motivate and retain the Company's most senior executives is considered critical to the Company's success and to advancing the interests of its shareholders. CLAWBACK POLICY
We have a policy that if an accounting restatement occurs after incentive payments have been made, due to the results of misconduct associated with financial reporting, the Committee will seek repayment of the incentive compensation from our CEO and CFO, and the Committee has the discretion to request repayment of incentive compensation from our other officers, taking into consideration the individual roles and responsibilities prompting the restatement.
In addition, our award agreements for restricted stock and target performance shares include clawback provisions whereby the participant may be required to repay all income or gains previously realized in respect of such awards if his or her employment is terminated for cause, or if, within one year following termination of employment, the Board determines that the participant engaged in conduct prior to his or her termination that would have constituted the basis for a termination of employment for cause.
REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

(2) Stock Awards represent the grant date fair value related to restricted stock and performance shares that have been granted as a component of long-term incentive compensation and for 2016, include special achievement awards associated with the acquisition of SourceGas. The grant date fair value is computed in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for stock compensation. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation represents amounts earned under the Short-Term Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee approved the payout of the 2018 awards on February 8, 2019 and the awards were paid on March 8, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4) Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings represents the net positive increase in actuarial value of the Pension Plan, Pension Restoration Benefit ("PRB") and Pension Equalization Plans ("PEP") for the respective years. These benefits have been valued using the assumptions disclosed in Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Because these assumptions sometimes change between measurement dates, the change in value reflects not only the change in value due to additional benefits earned during the period and the passage of time but also reflects the change in value caused by changes in the underlying actuarial assumptions. This has created significant volatility in the last three years with a large decrease in 2018 and a large increase in 2017 primarily related to the change in discount rates used to calculate the present value of these benefits. A value of zero is shown in the Summary Compensation Table for certain officers in 2018 because the SEC does not allow a negative number to be disclosed in the table. 
[END TABLE]
 The Pension Plan and PRB were frozen effective January 1, 2010 for participants who did not satisfy the age 45 and 10 years of service eligibility. Messrs. Kinzley, Evans and Iverson did not meet the eligibility choice criteria and their Defined Pension and PRB benefits were frozen. 
The PEP is offered through the Grandfathered Pension Equalization Plan ("Grandfathered PEP") and 2005 Pension Equalization Plan ("2005 PEP"). Mr. Emery is the only participant in the Grandfathered PEP and 2005 PEP. Messrs. Kinzley, Evans, Iverson and Buchholz are not participants in these plans; instead they receive employer contributions into a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDC"). The NQDC employer contributions are reported in the All Other Compensation column.
No Named Executive Officer received preferential or above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation. The change in value attributed to each Named Executive Officer from each plan is shown in the table below.

(2) The columns under "Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" show the range of payouts for 2018 performance under our Short-Term Incentive Plan as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled "Short-Term Incentive" on page 29. If the performance criteria are met, payouts can range from 50 percent of target at the threshold level to 200 percent of target at the maximum level. The 2019 bonus payment for 2018 performance has been made based on achieving the criteria described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, at 133 percent of target, and is shown in the Summary Compensation Table on page 38 in the column titled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." 
(3) The columns under "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards" show the range of payouts (in shares of stock) for the January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 performance period as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled "Long-Term Incentive – Performance Shares" on page 31. If the performance criteria are met, payouts can range from 25 percent of target to 200 percent of target. If a participant retires, suffers a disability or dies during the performance period, the participant or the participant's estate is entitled to that portion of the number of performance shares as such participant would have been entitled to had he or she remained employed, prorated for the number of months served. Performance shares are forfeited if employment is terminated for any other reason. During the performance period, dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the shares of common stock accrue for the benefit of the participant and are paid out at the end of the performance period.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(4) The column "All Other Stock Awards" reflects the number of shares of restricted stock granted on February 5, 2018 under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The restricted stock vests one-third each year over a three-year period, and automatically vests upon death, disability or a change in control. Unvested restricted stock is forfeited if employment is terminated for any other reason. Dividends are paid on the restricted stock and the dividends that were paid in 2018 are included in the column titled "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table on page 38. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5) The column "Grant Date Fair Value of Stock Awards" reflects the grant date fair value of each equity award computed in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for stock compensation. The grant date fair value for the performance shares was $61.82 per share and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions used in the calculation are included in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The grant date fair value for the restricted stock was $52.41 per share for the February 5, 2018 grant, which was the market value of our common stock on the date of grant as reported on the NYSE.

PENSION BENEFITS FOR 2018
Several years ago, we adopted a defined contribution plan design as our primary retirement plan and amended our Pension Plan and Nonqualified Pension Plans for all eligible employees to incorporate a partial freeze in which the accrual of benefits ceased for certain participants while other participants were allowed an election to continue to accrue benefits. Employees eligible to elect continued participation were those employees who were at least 45 years old and had at least 10 years of eligible service with us as of January 1, 2010. Messrs. Emery and Buchholz were our only Named Executive Officers who met the age and service requirement and continue to accrue benefits under the Pension Plan and the Pension Restoration Plan. Benefits under the Pension Plan and Pension Restoration Plan were frozen for Messrs. Kinzley, Evans and Iverson. In addition, Mr. Emery  received supplemental pension benefits under the Grandfathered Pension Equalization Plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2004, and the 2005 Pension Equalization Plan. None of our Named Executive Officers received any pension benefit payments during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
The present value accumulated by each Named Executive Officer from each plan is shown in the table below:

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN
Our Pension Plan is a qualified pension plan in which all of our Named Executive Officers are included. As discussed above, several years ago we amended our Pension Plan to incorporate a partial freeze in which the accrual of benefits ceased for certain participants while other participants were allowed an election to continue to accrue benefits. Messrs. Emery and Buchholz were the only Named Executive Officers who met the age and service requirement and elected to continue with the existing plan.
The Pension Plan provides benefits at retirement based on length of employment service and average compensation levels during the highest five consecutive years of the last ten years of service. For purposes of the benefit calculation, earnings include wages and other cash compensation received from us, including any bonus, commission, unused paid time off or incentive compensation. It also includes any elective before-tax contributions made by the employee to a Company-sponsored cafeteria plan or 401(k) plan. However, it does not include any expense reimbursements, taxable fringe benefits, moving expenses or moving/relocation allowances, nonqualified deferred compensation, non-cash incentives, stock options and any  payments of long-term incentive compensation such as restricted stock or payments under performance share plans. The Internal Revenue Code places maximum limitations on the amount of compensation that may be recognized when determining benefits of qualified pension plans. In 2018, the maximum amount of compensation that could be recognized when determining compensation was $275,000 (called "covered compensation"). Our employees do not contribute to the plan. The amount of the annual contribution by us to the plan is based on an actuarial determination.
The benefit formula for the Named Executive Officers in the plan is the sum of (a) and (b) below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Credited Service after January 31, 2000 
0.9% of average earnings (up to covered compensation), multiplied by credited service after January 31, 2000 minus the number of years of credited service before January 31, 2000   Plus1.3% of average earnings in excess of covered compensation, multiplied by credited service after January 31, 2000 minus the number of years of credited service before January 31, 2000 
0.9% of average earnings (up to covered compensation), multiplied by credited service after January 31, 2000 minus the number of years of credited service before January 31, 2000   Plus1.3% of average earnings in excess of covered compensation, multiplied by credited service after January 31, 2000 minus the number of years of credited service before January 31, 2000 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Credited Service before January 31, 2000 
1.2% of average earnings (up to covered compensation), multiplied by credited service before January 31, 2000   Plus1.6% of average earnings in excess of covered compensation, multiplied by credited service before January 31, 2000 
1.2% of average earnings (up to covered compensation), multiplied by credited service before January 31, 2000   Plus1.6% of average earnings in excess of covered compensation, multiplied by credited service before January 31, 2000 
[END TABLE]
Normal retirement is defined as age 65 under the plan. However, a participant may retire and begin taking unreduced benefits at age 62 with five years of service. Participants who have completed at least five years of credited service can retire and receive defined benefit pension benefits as early as age 55. However, the retirement benefit will be reduced by five percent for each year of retirement before age 62.  Messrs. Emery, Evans, Iverson and Buchholz are currently age 55 or older and are entitled to early retirement benefits under this provision.
PENSION EQUALIZATION PLANS AND PENSION RESTORATION BENEFIT
We also have a Grandfathered Pension Equalization Plan, a 2005 Pension Equalization Plan and a Pension Restoration Benefit. These are nonqualified supplemental plans, in which benefits are not tax deductible until paid. The plans are designed to provide the higher paid executive employee a retirement benefit which, when added to social security benefits and the pension to be received under the Pension Plan, will approximate retirement benefits being paid by other employers to their employees in similar executive positions. The employee's pension from the qualified Pension Plan is limited by the Internal Revenue Code. The 2018 pension limit was set at $220,000 annually and the compensation taken into account in determining contributions and benefits could not exceed $275,000 and could not include nonqualified deferred compensation. The amount of deferred compensation paid under nonqualified plans is not subject to these limits.
As a result of the change in the Pension Plan discussed above, the benefits for certain officers (including Messrs. Kinzley, Evans, and Iverson) under the Nonqualified Pension Plans were significantly reduced because the nonqualified benefit calculations were linked to the benefits earned in the Pension Plan. The Compensation Committee amended the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan to provide non-elective nonqualified restoration benefits to those affected officers who were not eligible to continue accruing benefits under the Pension Plan and Nonqualified Pension Plans.
Grandfathered Pension Equalization Plan and 2005 Pension Equalization Plan. The Grandfathered Pension Equalization Plan provides the pension equalization benefits to each participant who had earned and vested benefits before January 1, 2005, and is not subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The 2005 Pension Equalization Plan provides the pension equalization benefits to each participant that were earned and vested on or after January 1, 2005, and is subject to the provisions of Section 409A.
These plans have been frozen to new participants since 2002. Mr. Emery is a fully vested participant in the Grandfathered and 2005 Pension Equalization Plans. Messrs. Kinzley, Evans, Iverson, and Buchholz are not participants in these plans. The annual benefit for Mr. Emery is 30 percent of his average earnings multiplied by the vesting percentage. Average earnings are normally an employee's average earnings for the five highest consecutive full years of employment during the ten full years of employment immediately preceding the year of calculation. The annual benefit is paid on a monthly basis for 15 years and, if deceased, to the employee's designated beneficiary or estate, commencing at the earliest of death or when the employee is both retired and 62 years of age or more. A participant with vested benefits who is 55 years of age or older and who is no longer our employee may elect to be paid benefits beginning at age 55 or older, subject to a discount, ranging from 60.3 percent of the benefit payable at age 55 to 93 percent of the benefit payable at age 61.
Pension Restoration Benefit. In the event that at the time of a participant's retirement, the participant's salary level exceeds the qualified Pension Plan annual compensation limitation ($275,000 in 2018) or includes nonqualified deferred compensation, then the participant will receive an additional benefit, called a "Pension Restoration Benefit," which is measured by the difference between (i) the monthly benefit that would have been provided to the participant under the Pension Plan as if there were no annual compensation limitation and no exclusion on nonqualified deferred compensation, and (ii) the monthly benefit to be provided to the participant under the Pension Plan. The Pension Restoration Benefit applies to all of the Named Executive Officers that have a pension benefit.  
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION FOR 2018
We have a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Eligibility to participate in the plan is determined by the Compensation Committee and primarily consists of only corporate officers.
A summary of the activity in the plan and the aggregate balance as of December 31, 2018 for our Named Executive Officers is shown in the following table. Our Named Executive Officers received no withdrawals or distributions from the plan in 2018.

The deferrals are deposited into hypothetical investment accounts where the participants may direct the investment of the deferrals as allowed by the plan. The investment options are the same as those offered to all employees in the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan except for a fixed rate option, which was set at 3.12 percent in 2018. Investment earnings are credited to the participants' accounts. Upon retirement, we will distribute the account balance to the participant according to the  distribution election filed with the Compensation Committee. The participants may elect either a lump sum payment to be paid within 30 days of retirement (requires a six-month deferral for benefits not vested as of December 31, 2004), or annual or monthly installments over a period of years designated by the participant, but not to exceed 15 years. As of January 1, 2019, Messrs. Kinzley, Evans, Iverson and Buchholz are 100 percent vested in the plan.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table describes the potential payments and benefits under our compensation and benefit plans and arrangements to which our Named Executive Officers would be entitled upon termination of employment. Except for (i) certain terminations following a change in control ("CIC"), as described below, (ii) pro-rata payout of incentive compensation and the acceleration of vesting of equity awards upon retirement, death or disability, and (iii) certain pension and nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements described under Pension Benefits for 2018 and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018 above, there are no agreements, arrangements or plans that entitle the Named Executive Officers to severance, perquisites, or other enhanced benefits upon termination of their employment. Any agreements to provide other payments or benefits to a terminating executive officer would be in the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
The amounts shown below assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, and thus include estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to our Named Executive Officers upon their termination. The table does not include amounts such as base salary, short-term incentives and stock awards that the Named Executive Officers earned due to employment through December 31, 2018 and distributions of vested benefits such as those described under Pension Benefits for 2018 and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018. The table also does not include a value for outplacement services because this would be a de minimis amount. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such Named Executive Officer's separation from us.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) The amounts reflected for involuntary or good reason termination after a change in control include the benefits a Named Executive Officer would receive in the event of a change in control as a sole event without the involuntary or good reason termination. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Assumes that in the event of a change in control, Mr. Emery will receive an additional three years of credited and vesting service and the other Named Executive Officers will receive an additional two years of credited and vesting service towards the benefit accrual under their applicable retirement plans. For Mr. Emery, this would be the Pension Plan and Nonqualified Pension Plans. For Messrs. Kinzley, Evans, Iverson and Buchholz, this would be the Retirement Contributions and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation contributions. In addition, Mr. Buchholz would also have a Pension Restoration Contribution. The benefits will immediately vest and payments will commence at the earliest eligible date unless the executive has elected a later date for the nonqualified plans. This is age 55 for Mr. Kinzley.  Because Messrs. Emery, Evans, Iverson and Buchholz are age 55 or older, they are already retiree eligible.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3) Welfare benefits include medical coverage, dental coverage, life insurance, short-term disability coverage and long-term disability coverage. The calculation assumes that the Named Executive Officer does not take employment with another employer following termination, elects continued welfare benefits until age 55 or, if later, the end of the two year benefit continuation period (three years for Mr. Emery) and elects retiree medical benefits thereafter. Retirement is assumed to occur at the earliest eligible date. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4) In the event of death or disability, the acceleration of equity awards represents the acceleration of unvested restricted stock and the assumed payout of the pro-rata share of the performance shares for the January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 performance periods. In the event of retirement, all unvested restricted stock is forfeited and the acceleration of equity awards represents only the pro-rata share of the performance shares. We assumed a 48 percent payout of the performance shares for the January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 performance period and a 118 percent payout of target for the January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 performance period based on our Monte Carlo valuations at December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of a change in control or an involuntary or good reason termination after a change in control, the acceleration of equity awards represents the acceleration of unvested restricted stock and the payout of the pro-rata share of the performance shares calculated as if the performance period ended on December 31, 2018 for the January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020 performance periods.
The valuation of the restricted stock was based upon the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, and the valuation of the performance shares was based on the average closing price of our common stock for the last 20 trading days of 2018. Actual amounts to be paid out at the time of separation from us may vary significantly based upon the market value of our common stock at that time.
Payments Made Upon Termination. Regardless of the manner in which a Named Executive Officer's employment terminates, he or his beneficiaries may be entitled to receive amounts earned during his term of employment. These include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued salary and unused vacation pay; 
• amounts vested under the Pension Plan and Nonqualified Pension Plans; 
• amounts vested under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan; and 
• amounts vested under the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. 
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon Retirement. In the event of retirement of a Named Executive Officer, in addition to the items identified above, he will also receive the benefit of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro-rata share of the performance shares for each outstanding performance period upon completion of the performance period; and 
• a pro-rata share of the actual payout under the Short-Term Incentive Plan upon completion of the incentive period. 
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability. In the event of death or disability of a Named Executive Officer, in addition to the items identified above for payments made upon termination, he will also receive the benefit of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units; 
• a pro-rata share of the performance shares for each outstanding performance period upon completion of the performance period; and 
• a pro-rata share of the actual payout under the Short-Term Incentive Plan upon completion of the incentive period. 
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon a Change in Control. Our Named Executive Officers have change in control agreements that terminate November 15, 2019. The renewal of the change in control agreements is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. The change in control agreements provide for certain payments and other benefits to be payable upon a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment, either involuntary or for a good reason. In order to receive any payments under the agreements, the Named Executive Officer must sign a waiver that includes a one-year non-competition clause and two-year non-solicitation and non-disparagement clauses.
A change in control is defined in the agreements as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an acquisition of 30 percent or more of our common stock, except for certain defined acquisitions, such as acquisition by employee benefit plans, us, any of our subsidiaries, or acquisition by an underwriter holding the securities in connection with a public offering thereof; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• members of our incumbent Board of Directors cease to constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the Board of Directors, with the incumbent Board of Directors being defined as those individuals consisting of the Board of Directors on the date the agreement was executed and any other directors elected subsequently whose election was approved by the incumbent Board of Directors; or 
• approval by our shareholders of: 
- a merger, consolidation, or reorganization; 
- liquidation or dissolution; or 
- an agreement for sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, with exceptions for transactions which do not involve an effective change in control of voting securities or Board of Directors membership, and transfers to subsidiaries or sale of subsidiaries; and 
• all regulatory approvals required to effect a change in control have been obtained and the transaction constituting the change in control has been consummated. 
[END TABLE]
In the change in control agreements, a good reason for termination that triggers payment of benefits includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction of the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities; 
• a reduction in the executive's annual compensation or any failure to pay the executive any compensation or benefits to which he or she is entitled within seven days of the date due; 
• any material breach by us of any provisions of the change in control agreement; 
• requiring the executive to be based outside a 50-mile radius from his or her usual and normal place of work; or 
• our failure to obtain an agreement, satisfactory to the executive, from any successor company to assume and agree to perform under the change in control agreement. 
[END TABLE]
Upon a change in control, Mr. Emery will have an employment contract for a three-year period and the other Named Executive Officers (NEOs) will have an employment contract for a two-year period, but not beyond age 65 ("employment term"). During this employment term, the executive will receive annual compensation at least equal to the highest rate in effect at any time during the one-year period preceding the change in control and will also receive employment welfare benefits, pension benefits and supplemental retirement benefits on a basis no less favorable than those received prior to the change in control. Annual compensation is defined to include amounts which are includable in the gross income of the executive for federal income tax purposes, including base salary, targeted short-term incentive, targeted long-term incentive grants and awards, and matching contributions or other benefits payable under the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, but exclude restricted stock awards, performance units or stock options that become vested or exercisable pursuant to a change in control.
If a Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the employment term by us for cause or disability, by reason of the Named Executive Officer's death, or by the Named Executive Officer without good reason, the Named Executive Officer will receive all amounts of compensation earned or accrued through the termination date. If the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated because of death or disability, the Named Executive Officer or his beneficiaries will also receive a pro rata bonus equal to 100 percent of the target incentive for the portion of the year served.
If Mr. Emery's employment is terminated during the employment term (other than by reason of death) (i) by us other than for cause or disability, or (ii) by Mr. Emery for a good reason, then Mr. Emery is entitled to the following benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all accrued compensation and a pro-rata bonus (the same as Mr. Emery or Mr. Emery's beneficiaries would receive in the event of death or disability discussed above); 
• severance pay equal to 2.99 times Mr. Emery's severance compensation defined as his base salary and short-term incentive target on the date of the change in control; provided that if Mr. Emery has attained the age of 62 on the termination date, the severance payment will be adjusted for the ratio of the number of days remaining to his 65th birthday to 1,095 days; 
• continuation of employee welfare benefits for three years following the termination date unless Mr. Emery becomes covered under the health insurance coverage of a subsequent employer which does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of Mr. Emery or his eligible dependents; 
• following the three-year period, Mr. Emery may elect to receive coverage under the employee welfare plans of the successor entity at his then-current level of benefits (or reduced coverage at his election) by paying the premiums charged to regular full-time employees for such coverage, and is eligible to continue receiving such coverage through the date of his retirement; 
• three additional years of service and age will be credited to Mr. Emery's retiree medical savings account and the account balance will become fully vested and he is eligible to use the account balance to offset retiree medical premiums at the later of age 55 or the end of the three year continuation period; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• three years of additional credited service under the 2005 Pension Equalization Plan, Pension Restoration Plan and Pension Plan; and 
• outplacement assistance services for up to six months. 
[END TABLE]
In connection with Mr. Emery's retirement as President and Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee does not intend to renew Mr. Emery's Change in Control agreement beyond its current expiration on November 15, 2019.
If any other NEO's employment is terminated during the employment term (other than by death) (i) by us other than for cause or disability, or (ii) by the NEO for a good reason, then the NEO is entitled to the following benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all accrued compensation and a pro-rata bonus (the same as the NEO or the NEO's beneficiaries would receive in the event of death or disability discussed above); 
• severance pay equal to two times the NEO's severance compensation defined as the NEO's base salary and short-term incentive target on the date of the change in control; provided that if the NEO has attained the age of 63 on the termination date, the severance payment shall be adjusted for the ratio of the number of days remaining to the NEO's 65th birthday to 730 days; 
• continuation of employee welfare benefits for two years following the termination date unless the NEO becomes covered under the health insurance coverage of a subsequent employer which does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of the NEO or the NEO's eligible dependents; 
• following the two-year period, the NEO may elect to receive coverage under the employee welfare plans of the successor entity at his then-current level of benefits (or reduced coverage at the NEO's election) by paying the premiums charged to regular full-time employees for such coverage, and is eligible to continue receiving such coverage through the date of his retirement; 
• two additional years of service and age will be credited to the NEO's retiree medical savings account and the account balance will become fully vested and the NEO is eligible to use the account balance to offset retiree medical premiums at the later of age 55 or the end of the two year continuation period; 
• two years of additional credited service under the executives' applicable retirement plans; and 
• outplacement assistance services for up to six months. 
[END TABLE]
The change in control agreements do not contain a benefit to cover any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The executive must sign a waiver and release agreement in order to receive the severance payment.  
PAY RATIO FOR 2018
We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. David Emery, our Chief Executive Officer in 2018.
Based on the information below for the fiscal year 2018 and calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we reasonably estimate that the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 49:1.

PROPOSAL 3 ADVISORY VOTE ON OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
We are providing shareholders with an annual advisory, non-binding vote on the executive compensation of our Named Executive Officers (commonly referred to as "say on pay"). Accordingly, shareholders will vote on approval of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure in this proxy statement.
This vote is non-binding. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee expect to consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions to the extent they can determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results. At our 2018 annual meeting, shareholders owning 96 percent of the shares voted approved  our executive compensation.
As described at length in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, we believe our executive compensation program is reasonable, competitive and strongly focused on pay for performance. The compensation of our Named Executive Officers varies depending upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals, both individual and corporate. Our short-term incentive is tied to earnings per share targets that reward our executives when they deliver targeted financial results. Our long-term incentives are tied to market performance with 50 percent delivered in restricted stock and 50 percent delivered in performance shares. Entitlement to the performance shares is based on our total shareholder return over a three-year performance period compared to our Performance Peer Group. Through stock ownership guidelines, equity incentives and clawback provisions, we align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders and our long-term interests. Our executive compensation policies have enabled us to attract and retain talented and experienced senior executives who can drive financial and strategic growth objectives that are intended to enhance shareholder value. We believe that the 2018 compensation of our Named Executive Officers was appropriate and aligned with our 2018 results and positions us for long-term growth.
Shareholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosures to better understand the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.
The advisory resolution to approve executive compensation is non-binding. However, our Board of Directors will consider shareholders to have approved our executive compensation if the number of votes cast "For" the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast "Against" the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on such vote.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the advisory vote on executive compensation.  
TRANSACTION OF OTHER BUSINESS
Our Board of Directors does not intend to present any business for action by our shareholders at the meeting except the matters referred to in this proxy statement. If any other matters should be properly presented at the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote thereon in accordance with the recommendations of our Board of Directors.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders and considered for inclusion in our proxy materials must be received by our Corporate Secretary in writing at our executive offices at 7001 Mount Rushmore Road, P.O. Box 1400, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709, on or prior to November 16, 2019. Any proposal submitted must be in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Additionally, a shareholder may submit a proposal or director nominee for consideration at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, but not for inclusion of the proposal or director nominee in our proxy materials, if the shareholder gives timely written notice of such proposal in accordance with Article I, Section 9 of our Bylaws. In general, Article I, Section 9 provides that, to be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary in writing not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders.
Our 2019 annual meeting is scheduled for April 30, 2019. Ninety days prior to the first anniversary of this date will be January 31, 2020, and 120 days prior to the first anniversary of this date will be January 1, 2020. For business to be properly requested by the shareholder to be brought before the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must comply with all of the requirements of Article I, Section 9 of our Bylaws, not just the timeliness requirements set forth above.
SHARED ADDRESS SHAREHOLDERS
In accordance with a notice sent to eligible shareholders who share a single address, we are sending only one annual report and proxy statement to that address unless we receive instructions to the contrary from any shareholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. However, if a shareholder of record residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate annual report or proxy statement in the future, he or she may contact Shareholder Relations at the below address.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE
In addition to presenting our earnings information in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company has provided non-GAAP earnings data reflecting adjustments for special items as specified in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures table above. EPS from continuing operations, as adjusted, is defined as EPS from continuing operations adjusted for expenses and other items that the Company believes do not reflect the Company's core operating performance. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because the items excluded are not indicative of the Company's continuing operating results. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as an indicator for planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by other income and expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring.
