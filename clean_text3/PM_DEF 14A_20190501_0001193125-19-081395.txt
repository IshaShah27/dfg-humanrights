2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
And Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
To be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 
March 21, 2019 
Dear Fellow Shareholder, 
You are cordially invited to join us at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI" or the "Company") to be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019, at 9:00 a.m., in the Empire State Ballroom at the Grand Hyatt New York, 109 East 42nd Street, New York, New York. 
At this year's meeting, we will vote on the election of twelve directors, an advisory say-on-pay vote approving executive compensation, and the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers SA as the Company's independent auditors. There will also be a report on the Company's business, and shareholders will have an opportunity to ask questions. 
We anticipate that a large number of shareholders will attend the meeting. Because seating is limited, you may bring only one immediate family member as a guest. All attendees must present an admission ticket and government-issued photographic identification. To request an admission ticket, please follow the instructions set forth on page 60 in response to Question 4. 
The meeting facilities will open at 7:30 a.m. on May 1, 2019. We suggest you arrive early to facilitate your registration and security clearance. Those needing special assistance at the meeting are requested to write to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 120 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017-5579. For your comfort and security, you will not be permitted to bring any packages, briefcases, large pocketbooks or bags into the meeting. Also, cellular and digital phones, audio tape recorders, laptops and other portable electronic devices, video and still cameras, pagers and pets will not be permitted into the meeting. We thank you in advance for your patience and cooperation with these rules, which assist us in conducting a safe and orderly meeting. 
Sadly, Sergio Marchionne, who served on our Board since our spin-off in 2008, passed away last year. Sergio was an invaluable member of our Board, with boundless energy, sage advice and deep perception, always holding us by his example to the highest of standards. In short, he was an ideal director. We will miss him dearly. 
Dr. Harold Brown retired from the Board last year and, sadly, passed away earlier this year. During his distinguished career, Harold served his country as Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Secretary of Defense, President of the California Institute of Technology, and in other capacities too numerous to mention. Our Company was fortunate to have Harold as a member of the Board of Directors. His intellect, drive, breadth of experience, integrity, sense of humor, and sheer generosity of spirit are irreplaceable. 
Your vote is important. We encourage you to sign and return your proxy card, or use telephone or Internet voting prior to the meeting, so that your shares of common stock will be represented and voted at the meeting even if you cannot attend.

 Sincerely,     Sincerely, 
 LOUIS C. CAMILLERI CHAIRMAN OF THE  BOARD     ANDRÉ CALANTZOPOULOS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 4 
This proxy statement contains proposals to be voted on at our Annual Meeting and other information about our Company and our corporate governance practices. We provide below a brief summary of certain information contained in this proxy statement. The summary does not contain all of the information you should consider. Please read the entire proxy statement carefully before voting. 
2018 Business Performance Highlights 
We achieved robust results from our combustible tobacco portfolio and nearly doubled our in-market sales of IQOS heated tobacco units driven by growth in all IQOS markets. However, we performed well below our ambitious growth targets for net revenues and adjusted operating income. This shortfall was primarily due to the unexpected slowdown in the rate of smokers switching to IQOS in Japan and related distributor inventory adjustments and, to a lesser extent, the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina. Our share of Top 30 OI markets was also below target. However, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our target, aided by a lower effective tax rate and lower net interest expense as a result of U.S. tax reform. Our operating cash flow growth also exceeded the target. 
We are naturally disappointed in the underperformance of certain of our ambitious financial growth targets. However, as further discussed on page 31, we made very good progress in 2018 on our strategic initiatives and transformation, and we have established a solid foundation from which to deliver better performance in 2019 and beyond.

5• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
Investor Outreach 
Throughout the year, the Company engages in an extensive shareholder outreach program during which it seeks input on a range of matters, including executive compensation and corporate governance. In 2018, we met with 53 of our top 100 institutional investors, representing 69% of our available global shareholder base (which excludes index and pension funds that do not meet with management), to discuss our business and environmental, social and governance issues. In addition to these regular Investor Relations engagements, we invited 82 of our largest shareholders, holding approximately 60% of our outstanding shares, to participate in individual conference calls to discuss executive compensation and corporate governance. These engagements provided us a better understanding of our shareholders' priorities, perspectives and positions. We reported the substance of these engagements to our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and our entire Board of Directors. 
In September 2018, we held our biennial Investor Day, which was attended in person by sell-side analysts and by representatives of the holders of approximately 39% of our available global shareholder base. All shareholders were able to view the presentations by webcast. During this conference, shareholders received detailed presentations about our business and had the opportunity to meet with and ask questions of our senior management team. Before the conference, we commissioned an independent third party to survey sell-side analysts and institutional shareholders on a number of topics, including those they most wished to see addressed at the conference and any additional messages they wished to convey to management. The survey results were reported to us anonymously and addressed in the presentations. We reported the results of this conference to our Finance Committee and to our entire Board of Directors. 
Our Focus on Sustainability 
As part of our continued focus on sustainability, the Board in 2018 added oversight of our sustainability strategies and performance to the charter of the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our 2018 Annual Report reviews how we have refined our sustainability strategy to align with societal expectations. In 2018, we made the CDP Climate A list for the fifth year in a row and also earned a place on CDP's Supplier Engagement leader board for the second consecutive year. The Company also improved its ranking in the 2018 SAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment, an annual evaluation of companies' sustainability practices. 
EQUAL-SALARY Certification 
Earlier this year, we became the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation. This achievement is an important building block on the road to creating a more inclusive gender-balanced workplace. 
Shareholder Proposal 
Trinity Health, together with other co-proponents, submitted a shareholder proposal for inclusion in this proxy statement requesting the Board of Directors to review the Company's adherence to its policies aimed at discouraging smoking among young people and to report the results of that review to shareholders by November 2019. The Company agreed to the request and the proponents withdrew the proposal. 
2019 Shareholder Vote Recommendations 
The Board of Directors makes the following recommendations to shareholders: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Item 1:    Election of Directors     FOR each nominee   13   
 Item 2:    Advisory Vote Approving Executive Compensation     FOR   54   
 Item 3:    Ratification of the Selection of Independent Auditors for 2019     FOR   57   
[END TABLE]
PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 6 
Board Responsibility and Meetings 
The primary responsibility of the Board of Directors is to foster the long-term success of the Company, consistent with its statutory duty to shareholders. The Board has responsibility for establishing broad corporate policies, setting strategic direction, and overseeing management, which is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company. In fulfilling this role, each director must exercise his or her good faith business judgment of the best interests of the Company. 
The Board holds regular meetings, typically during the months of February, March, May, June, September and December, and additional meetings when necessary. The organizational meeting follows immediately after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board held six regular meetings in 2018. The Board meets in executive session regularly with no members of management being present. Directors are expected to attend Board meetings, the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and meetings of the Committees on which they serve, with the understanding that on occasion a director may be unable to attend. 
During 2018, all nominees for director then in office attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and all Committees on which they served, and all but one of the nominee directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
The Board approves the Company's annual budget each year and receives updates of the Company's performance against the budget throughout the year. The Board also reviews and approves the Company's three-year plan each year, typically in a two-day session. The Board regularly receives presentations on the Company's longer-term objectives and plans. 
Governance Guidelines, Policies and Codes 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and a code of conduct known as the Guidebook for Success, an interactive, plain language tool that describes the fundamental beliefs and attributes that unite and guide us in pursuing PMI's goals, illustrates how to meet our commitments to these beliefs and attributes, and explains why it is critical to do so. The Guidebook applies to all employees, including the Company's principal executive officer, chief operating officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to directors. The Board has also adopted a policy with regard to reviewing certain transactions in which the Company is a participant and an officer, director or nominee for director has, had or may have a direct or indirect material interest. All of these documents are available free of charge on the Company's website, www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us, and will be provided free of charge to any shareholder requesting a copy by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Philip Morris International Inc., 120 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017-5579. 
The information on the Company's websites is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this proxy statement or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Leadership Structure 
The Board believes that no particular leadership structure is inherently superior to all others under all circumstances. It determines from time to time the structure that best serves the interests of the Company and its shareholders under the then-prevailing circumstances. Currently, Louis C. Camilleri serves as our non-executive Chairman, and André Calantzopoulos serves as our Chief Executive Officer. 
As Chairman, Mr. Camilleri facilitates communication between the Board and management and assists the CEO with long-term strategy. He presides at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board and assists in the preparation of agendas and materials for Board meetings, working together with the Presiding Director, who approves the agendas before they are disseminated to the Board. Input is sought from all directors as to topics they wish to review. The Board also has a Presiding Director as described immediately below. 
Presiding Director 
The non-management directors elect at the annual organizational meeting one independent director as the Presiding Director. The Presiding Director's responsibilities are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    preside over executive sessions of the non-management directors and at all  meetings at which the Chairman is not present;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    call meetings of the non-management directors as he or she deems necessary;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    be available for consultation and communication if requested by major shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Presiding Director is invited to attend all meetings of Committees of the Board. Lucio A. Noto currently serves as the Presiding Director. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has established various standing Committees to assist with the performance of its responsibilities. These Committees and their current members are listed below. The Board designates the members of these Committees and the Committee Chairs at its organizational meeting following the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, based on the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate 
 Governance Committee. The Board has adopted written charters for each of these Committees and these charters are available on the Company's website at www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us. The Chair of each Committee develops the agenda for that Committee and determines the frequency and length of Committee meetings. Each Committee meets as often as it deems appropriate and each has sole authority to retain its own legal counsel, experts and consultants. 
The Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee each consists entirely of non-management directors, all of whom the Board has determined are independent within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and that Lucio A. Noto is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning set forth in the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. No member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received any payments in 2018 from Philip Morris International Inc. or its subsidiaries, other than compensation received as a director.

Board Risk Oversight 
Risk oversight is conducted both by the Committees of the Board with respect to their areas of responsibility as well as by the full Board. Management has identified and prioritized key enterprise risks based on four risk dimensions: the impact a risk could have on the organization if it occurs, the likelihood a risk will occur, the velocity with which a risk would affect the organization if it occurs, and the interconnectivity of a risk with other risks. As part of the risk management process, the Company has established a Corporate Risk Governance Committee ("CRGC") comprising the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President and Controller, the Vice President, Corporate Audit, and the Vice President, Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer. Ownership of each of the prioritized risks is assigned to a member of senior management, and oversight of the management of each risk is assigned to a particular Board Committee or to the full Board. Management reports on these risks to the appropriate Committee and to the full Board throughout the year. The risk management oversight by each Committee is indicated in the chart on pages 9 and 10. The full Board oversees the management of risks relating to the Company's business plan and litigation, and it receives reports on risk management by each Committee. The roles of the various components of risk assessment, management and oversight are shown below. 
In 2018, the Company conducted a full-scale reassessment of the strategic enterprise risk management program that had been adopted in 2015. As part of the reassessment, management rationalized the list of strategic enterprise risks to eliminate overlap and to converge the focus. It revised the descriptions of various risks and identified new ones. It requalified the new list based on the four risk dimensions described above. Management updated the Board on the progress of the reassessment throughout 2018.

Communications with the Board 
Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board may do so by writing to the Presiding Director, Board of Directors of Philip Morris International Inc., 120 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017-5579. The non-management directors have established procedures for the handling of communications from shareholders and other interested parties and directed the Corporate Secretary to act as their agent in processing any communications received. All communications that relate to matters that are within the scope of the responsibilities of the Board and its Committees are to be forwarded to the Presiding 
 Director. Communications that relate to matters that are within the responsibility of one of the Board Committees are also to be forwarded to the Chair of the appropriate Committee. Communications that relate to ordinary business matters that are not within the scope of the Board's responsibilities, such as customer complaints, are to be sent to the appropriate subsidiary. Solicitations, junk mail and obviously frivolous or inappropriate communications are not to be forwarded, but will be made available to any non-management director who wishes to review them.

Process for Nominating Directors 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating candidates for director and for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
In evaluating the suitability of individuals for Board membership, the Committee takes into account many factors. These include whether the individual meets requirements for independence; the individual's general understanding of the various disciplines relevant to the success of a large publicly-traded company in today's global business environment; the individual's understanding of the Company's global business and markets; the individual's professional expertise and educational background; and other factors, including nationality and gender, that promote diversity of views and experience. The Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group of directors that can best perpetuate the success of the business and represent long-term shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment, using its breadth of knowledge and experience. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the Committee also considers the director's attendance at meetings and participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board. The Committee has not established any specific minimum qualification standards for nominees to the Board, although from time to time the Committee may identify certain skills or attributes, such as financial experience, global business experience, consumer-centricity, digital transformation and scientific expertise, as being particularly desirable to help meet specific Board needs. 
In identifying candidates for Board membership, the Committee relies on suggestions and recommendations from the Board, shareholders, management and others. The Committee does not distinguish between nominees recommended by shareholders and other nominees. From time to time, the Committee also retains search firms to assist in identifying candidates for director, gathering information about their background and experience, and acting as an intermediary with such candidates. 
Shareholders wishing to suggest candidates to the Committee for consideration as directors must submit a written notice to the Corporate Secretary, who will provide it to the Committee. Our by-laws set forth the procedures a shareholder must follow to nominate directors. These procedures are summarized in this proxy statement under the caption "2020 Annual Meeting." 
In addition, our by-laws permit an eligible shareholder or group of shareholders who have owned 3% or more of PMI's shares for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy statement director candidates to occupy up to 20% of the authorized Board seats. 
Recommendations of the Board; Director Attributes, Diversity, Refreshment and Tenure 
It is proposed that twelve directors be elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors have been elected. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, the persons named and, unless otherwise marked, a proxy will be voted for such persons. Each of the nominees currently serves as a director and each was elected by the shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting. The Board believes that the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each of the nominees presented qualify them to deal with the complex global, regulatory, business, and financial issues facing the Company, and that the Board as a whole provides a breadth of knowledge, international experience, intellectual rigor and willingness to face tough issues. 
Our Board comprises a diverse group of individuals. Nine of the nominees, three of whom are women, are non-U.S. nationals. Ten different nationalities are represented, underscoring the global perspective of the Board taken as a whole. 
The Board has experienced a healthy level of director refreshment since our spin-off in 2008. Three of the original directors continue to serve on the Board. Of the remaining members of the Board, one joined in 2010, two in 2011, one in 2013, two in 2014, one in 2015, one in 2016 and one in 2018. The average tenure of the Company's nominees is 6.8 years. As new Board members gain experience, the Board rotates its various committee chairmanships. 
Although it is not anticipated that any of the persons named below will be unable or unwilling to stand for election, a proxy, in the event of such an occurrence, may be voted for a substitute designated by the Board. However, in lieu of designating a substitute, the Board may amend the Company's by-laws to reduce the number of directors. 
13• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
Independence of Nominees 
After receiving the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has determined that each of the following nominees for director is independent of and has no material relationship with the Company: Massimo Ferragamo, Werner Geissler, Lisa A. Hook, Jennifer Li, Jun Makihara, Kalpana Morparia, Lucio A. Noto, Frederik Paulsen, Robert B. Polet and Stephen M. Wolf. To assist it in making these determinations, the Board has adopted categorical standards of director independence that are set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Company's website at www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us. Each of the above-named nominees qualifies as independent under these standards. 
In making the determination that Mr. Camilleri is not independent, the Board considered the Company's relationship with Ferrari, which began in 1973, well before Mr. Camilleri became CEO of Ferrari in September 2018. The Company's Formula 1 sponsorship agreement and its renewals have been negotiated on an arms-length basis with executives of Ferrari prior to Mr. Camilleri's becoming CEO of Ferrari. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the sponsorship as a Related Person Transaction (see page 58) and determined that it is in the best interests of the Company. 
In making the affirmative determination that Ms. Morparia is independent, the Board considered the fact that the 
 Company has routine commercial relationships with J.P. Morgan Chase, Ms. Morparia's employer. Payments by the Company to J.P. Morgan Chase are immaterial and Ms. Morparia has no direct or indirect material interest in these routine commercial relationships. Ms. Morparia has never represented J.P. Morgan Chase in connection with its provision of services to the Company, and her compensation is not affected by any banking relationship between the Company and J.P. Morgan Chase. 
Majority Vote Standard in Uncontested Elections 
All directors are elected annually. The Company's by-laws provide that, where the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, directors shall be elected by a majority rather than by a plurality vote. Under applicable law, a director's term extends until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. Thus, an incumbent director who fails to receive a majority vote would continue to serve as a holdover director. To address that possibility, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require a director who receives less than a majority of the votes cast to offer to resign. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then consider, and recommend to the Board, whether to accept or reject the offer. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR each of the nominees identified below.

Non-employee directors may also elect to defer the award of shares of common stock and all or part of the annual and Committee retainers. Deferred fee amounts are "credited" to an unfunded account and may be "invested" in eight "investment choices," including a PMI common stock equivalent account. These "investment choices" parallel the investment options offered to employees under the PMI Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan and determine the "earnings" that are credited for bookkeeping purposes to a non-employee director's account. 
The Company reimburses non-employee directors (other than Dr. Paulsen) for their reasonable expenses incurred in attending Board of Directors, Committee and shareholder meetings and other corporate functions, including travel, meals and lodging. Non-employee directors (other than Dr. Paulsen) also are covered by business travel and accident insurance, which the Company maintains for their benefit when they travel on Company business, as well as group life insurance.

Executive Summary 
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis outlines the design of our executive compensation program components, the objectives and principles upon which they are based, our 2018 performance and the resulting decisions of the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to reflect that performance in setting compensation for our CEO, the other named executive officers, and the other members of our senior management team. 
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee 
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee consists entirely of non-management directors, all of whom our Board has determined are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Its responsibilities are described below and set forth in the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's website at www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us. The members of the Committee are: Werner Geissler (Chair), Lisa A. Hook, Lucio A. Noto, Robert B. Polet and Stephen M. Wolf. The Committee met five times in 2018. The Chair of the Committee, in consultation with the other members, sets meeting agendas. The Committee reports its actions and recommendations to the Board. 
Program Design, Philosophy and Objectives 
Our compensation and benefits program supports our business and financial objectives. Each component of our program is designed to achieve one or more of the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to support our ability to attract, develop and retain world-class leaders in a  controversial industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to align the interests of executives and shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to reward performance against pre-defined objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to support long-term business growth, superior financial results, sustainability efforts, societal alignment and  integrity of conduct;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    to align executive incentives with our risk management objectives.  
[END TABLE]
These objectives provide the framework for the various components of compensation and benefits and take into account the specific nature of our business. Together, these elements form an aggregate package that is intended to be appropriately competitive. The design of the overall package encompasses the following features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    a mix of fixed and at-risk compensation: the higher the  organizational level of the executive, the lower the fixed component of the overall compensation and benefits package;   
◾    a mix of annual and long-term compensation and benefits to appropriately reward the achievement of both annual  and long-term goals and objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    a mix of cash and deferred equity compensation that seeks to discourage actions that are solely driven by the  Companys share price at any given time to the detriment of PMIs long-term strategic goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    an optimal balance of equity compensation comprising both performance-based and time-based awards, without using  stock options, and with significant share ownership requirements, to align the interests of executives and shareholders while remaining mindful of the potentially dilutive nature of equity compensation on shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
In 2015, the Committee substantially revamped our executive compensation program. Our shareholders have overwhelmingly supported the new compensation program, approving our 2018 say-on-pay proposal by a vote of 97.14% and our 2017 Performance Incentive Plan by a vote of 96.18%. Based on this support and its own satisfaction with the current compensation program, the Committee determined not to make any substantial modifications to the program in 2019. 
The Committee reviews local market and Peer Group (see page 37) data, but does not target total direct compensation at a specific percentile of the market. Instead, the Committee sets total direct compensation at levels that it believes necessary to attract and retain talented executives in a controversial industry and remain competitive with other consumer product companies. 
27• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
Components of Our Total Direct Compensation Program 
The three components of total direct compensation are base salary, annual performance-based variable cash awards and variable equity awards. We also provide our executives retirement benefits and limited perquisites. 
Our total direct compensation program emphasizes pay-for-performance, and the one component that is fixed for a given year, base salary, constitutes the smallest portion of executive compensation for salary grades 26 and above. See page 29 for the target compensation mix of our NEOs in 2018. The key characteristics and key objectives of each component of our compensation program as it applies to our NEOs are as follows:

2018 Company Performance and Targets 
The Committee determined the 2018 cash incentive award performance rating based on 2018 results versus performance metrics pre-established by the Committee and defined on page 32. Each of the financial targets set by the Committee reflected appropriately ambitious performance goals. 
2018 Results: We achieved robust results from our combustible tobacco portfolio and nearly doubled our in-market sales of IQOS heated tobacco units driven by growth in all IQOS markets. However, we performed well below our ambitious growth targets for net revenues and adjusted operating income. This shortfall was primarily due to the unexpected slowdown in the rate of smokers switching to IQOS in Japan and related distributor inventory adjustments and, to a lesser extent, the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina. Our share of Top 30 OI markets was also below target. However, our adjusted diluted EPS growth exceeded our target, aided by a lower effective tax rate and lower net interest expense as a result of U.S. tax reform. Our operating cash flow growth also exceeded the target. 
Share of Top 30 OI Markets: We registered a growing or stable market share in 16 of our Top 30 OI markets, below our target of 18 markets. Our global market share, excluding China and the U.S., grew by 0.5 percentage points. Marlboro maintained its share of the cigarette market of 9.7%, excluding China and the U.S., despite the disproportionate impact of consumers switching from Marlboro cigarettes to IQOS heated tobacco units and the impact of sizable volume contraction in Saudi Arabia in the first half of the year. Marlboro remains the number one global brand. Heated tobacco units for the full year reached 1.6% of the total international tobacco market, excluding China and the U.S., an increase of 0.8 percentage points from 2017. 
Net Revenues: Net revenues of $29.6 billion reflected constant currency growth of 3.4%, below our ambitious target of 9.1%. This result was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated IQOS consumer acquisition in Japan and related distributor inventory adjustments. 
Adjusted OI: Adjusted OI of $11.4 billion reflected a constant currency increase of 0.1%, well below our target of 7.6% growth, reflecting the same factors that impacted net revenues. 
Adjusted Diluted EPS: Our 10.4% adjusted diluted EPS growth, excluding currency, surpassed our target of 8.5%. 
Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow, excluding currency, increased 8.9%, above our target of 6.9%. 
The Committee also rated our performance on the following key strategic initiatives that the Committee pre-set in February 2018, based on a ratings range of 0-70 if key initiatives were missed, 80-120 if they were mostly or all accomplished, and 130-150 if they were mostly or all exceeded: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Commercialize IQOS and other RRP platforms, applying learnings to achieve planned growth and conversion targets;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Develop commercially viable, scientifically substantiated, and differentiated RRPs and related ecosystems that  accelerate our vision towards a smoke-free future;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Develop our brand portfolio, including Marlboro, with selective innovation and expansion into the low/super low  segments;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Deploy our new operating model while reinforcing the new ways of working and fostering diversity to enrich our talent  pool, enabling rapid progress towards a truly consumer-centric company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Accelerate and develop our external engagement and communications capabilities to ensure further progress towards  establishing credibility, awareness and trust with both consumers and external stakeholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Progress significantly in obtaining regulatory and fiscal measures that accelerate consumer conversion from combustible  cigarettes to RRPs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Optimize our global value chain in combustible products and develop a cost effective and agile value chain for RRPs,  while judiciously managing and ensuring efficient use of our resources; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Leverage, integrate and prioritize new and existing digital capabilities to accelerate and enhance our transformation  and consumer experience.  
[END TABLE]
As a result of this evaluation, the Committee concluded that the Company had accomplished almost all of its strategic objectives and it assigned a strategic initiatives rating of 115.

Based on its performance against the pre-established targets, the Company earned an IC performance rating for 2018 of: 2018 80 vs. 2017 100 2016 110 vs. 
PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 32 
In addition to certifying the IC performance rating, the Committee rated each executive officer's personal performance during 2018. Individual ratings can range from 0% to 150%. To assure a disciplined, fair and equitable assessment, individual performance ratings were calibrated to reflect each executive's contribution to the overall results of the Company. Application of the following formula then determined the cash incentive award for each named executive officer in 2018.

TSR Performance Factor. The TSR performance factor, which determined 50% of the PSU payout, was calculated based on the Company's three-year rolling TSR versus the Company's Peer Group (see page 37). To adjust for market volatility, the TSR calculations are based on the average of the 20 trading days immediately before the start of the performance cycle and the last 20 trading days of the performance cycle. To reflect that several members of the Peer Group are primarily listed on foreign stock exchanges and report their financial results in different currencies, the Company measures the TSRs for those companies by using the price performance of their publicly traded American Depository Receipts ("U.S. ADRs"). The use of U.S. ADRs avoids the need to adjust the TSRs of non-U.S. Peers to reflect currency changes, and increases transparency by enabling shareholders to directly observe such TSRs. In addition to evaluating our relative TSR, if the Company's absolute TSR for a performance cycle is zero or less, the Committee will cap the TSR performance factor at 
33• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement target or less. This approach would limit rewards for a performance cycle in which we performed in line with, or better than, the Peer Group, but shareholders did not realize a positive return. The TSR performance factor for the 2016-2018 performance cycle was calculated relative to the Peer Group in accordance with the following schedule:

2019-2021 PSU Performance Cycle. For the 2019-2021 PSU Performance Cycle, the Committee retained the Company's performance factors employed for the 2016-2018 cycle except that it changed adjusted OCI to adjusted OI, consistent with our financial reporting. The Committee retained the TSR performance factors at the same levels shown on the previous page for the 2016-2018 PSU Performance Cycle. It set three-year Adjusted OI compound annual growth rate performance factors at 0% for growth below 4%, 50% for growth at the threshold level of 4%, 100% for growth at the target level of 7.5%, and 200% for growth at or above 10%. The Committee also established RRP unit shipment volume targets at what it believes are appropriately ambitious levels that reflect the Board-approved three-year plan. 
The Committee weighted the 2019-2021 performance factors as follows: TSR, 50%; Adjusted OI Growth, 30%; and RRP unit shipment volume, 20%. 
PSU Vesting Mechanics. At the end of the three-year performance cycle, the Company's performance factor for each of the three metrics will be calculated and then weighted, resulting in an overall PSU performance factor from 0-200%. This percentage will be applied to the executive's target PSU award to determine the number of shares of common stock to be issued to the executive. 
The Committee may adjust the PSU performance metrics if appropriate to reflect significant unplanned acquisitions or dispositions.

2018 Individual Performance and Compensation Decisions 
The 2018 performance ratings of each named executive officer reflect the fact that the Company performed below certain of our ambitious financial growth targets, but also the fact that this shortfall was primarily due to an unexpected slowdown in the rate of smokers switching to IQOS in a single market. 
André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer: The Committee assigned Mr. Calantzopoulos an individual performance rating for 2018 of 95% for the incentive compensation award and a rating of 105% for the equity award. As a result, Mr. Calantzopoulos received an annual incentive compensation award of CHF 2,299,850, or $2,295,549 based on the conversion rate on the date of the award. The Committee did not increase Mr. Calantzopoulos's base salary for 2019. 
Mr. Calantzopoulos's performance rating for the incentive compensation award reflects the Committee's view that under his leadership the Company achieved robust results in its cigarette business and nearly doubled its heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume, but fell short of certain financial targets. The Company also made excellent progress on its strategic initiatives as described on page 31. 
Mr. Calantzopoulos's individual performance rating for the equity award reflects that the Company achieved important milestones in the development of RRPs on many fronts: product development, commercialization, scientific substantiation, third-party engagement and the regulatory and fiscal environment. Mr. Calantzopoulos's equity rating also reflects his decisive leadership in the Company's external and internal transformation to an organization that is consumer-centric and digitally driven and well on the way to a future built on smoke-free products. 
Other Named Executive Officers: 
Marc S. Firestone: Mr. Firestone served as President, External Affairs and General Counsel in 2018. His incentive compensation and equity awards were each based on an individual performance rating of 105% and recognize his widespread contributions to the Company's results and inspiring leadership of our Law and Corporate Affairs 
 Departments. These ratings reflect his critical role in numerous regulatory, litigation and compliance strategic initiatives, notably his contribution to our continued progress in the regulatory and fiscal framework for RRPs and his insightful guidance of our external affairs initiatives and our strong compliance culture. 
Martin G. King: Mr. King served as Chief Financial Officer in 2018. His incentive compensation award was based on an individual performance rating of 85% and his equity award on an individual performance rating of 90%. These ratings recognize Mr. King's leadership and contributions to the management of our balance sheet, and the continued focus on process change optimization in the context of our RRP business transformation, as well as effective productivity and cost savings initiatives. He assured timely and transparent communication of our strategies and results to the investment community and played a critical role in the implementation of numerous cross-functional strategic initiatives. 
Jacek Olczak: Mr. Olczak served as our Chief Operating Officer in 2018. His incentive compensation award was based on an individual performance rating of 100% and his equity award on an individual performance rating of 110%. These ratings reflect the Committee's view that Mr. Olczak performed capably during his first year as the Company's COO, playing a leading role in the Company's transformation and its strong performance in the cigarette business. 
Effective April 1, 2019, the Committee increased Mr. Olczak's base salary by CHF 179,994, to CHF 1,200,000 ($1,197,756 based on the conversion rate on the date of the Committee's decision). 
Miroslaw Zielinski: Mr. Zielinski served as President, Science and Innovation in 2018. His incentive compensation and equity awards were each based on an individual performance rating of 85%. These ratings reflect his invaluable strategic contributions to the development of RRPs, the significant progress in scientific substantiation of our RRP platforms, the implementation of highly innovative route-to-market models, the development of novel adult consumer engagement platforms, and his critical contributions to the Company's long-term strategies.

Additional Compensation Policies and Processes 
Peer Group: The Committee uses a single customized peer group both to benchmark its compensation programs and to compare its TSR when calculating the Company's PSU performance factor.

37• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
Factors Mitigating Against Possible Adverse Consequences of Our Compensation Program: Several elements of our compensation program protect against the possibility that compensation incentives might cause employees to take risks that could materially adversely affect the Company. First, we do not have different incentive compensation award programs for particular business units or functions. Our annual incentive compensation and equity awards apply to management employees worldwide, and the award pools for each of those programs are based on company-wide performance measures that cannot be unduly influenced by a particular business unit or group. Second, all employees are rated on the same scale within general guidelines set by the Committee. These ratings are based on individual performance criteria so that no particular group of employees will all receive the same rating. Third, both the company-wide and the individual performance measures are subject to maximum levels that limit the amount of awards. 
Furthermore, with respect to the long-term equity component of our compensation program, RSUs generally vest only after three years from the date of grant, and PSUs generally vest to the extent pre-established targets are achieved over a three-year performance cycle. In addition, our executives are subject to share ownership requirements and comprehensive anti-hedging, anti-pledging and clawback policies described in the following four sections. 
Share Ownership Requirements: The Company has for several years set share ownership requirements for executives at levels that are among the highest for publicly owned companies. Unvested units of the Company's PSU equity award do not count towards the ownership requirement. The required share ownership level is shown below:

     Salary grade 28         15 times

Executives are required to meet their ownership levels within five years of joining PMI or within three years of a promotion. The Committee reviews each executive officer's compliance with the requirements on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2018, all of our named executive officers met or exceeded the applicable requirements. 
The Company also imposes share retention requirements on non-employee directors. (See page 23). 
Post-Termination Share Holding Period: In addition to these longstanding and rigorous share ownership requirements, the Committee has determined that if any equity award held by an executive officer under the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan vests on an accelerated basis upon such officer's termination of employment for any reason other than death or disability, the shares acquired must be held for at least one year following such termination. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies: The Company's anti-hedging policy prohibits directors, executive officers and other designated employees from purchasing any financial instrument or otherwise engaging in any transaction that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's shares held by them directly or indirectly, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, and other transactions with comparable economic consequences. The foregoing does not prohibit trading in broad-based index funds. 
Directors, executive officers and designated employees are also prohibited from engaging in short sales related to the Company's shares. 
The Company's anti-pledging policy prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging the Company's shares, including holding shares in a margin account. 
Clawback Policy Regarding the Adjustment or Recovery of Compensation: Under our Board-approved policy and as set forth in each named executive officer's equity award agreement, if the Board or an appropriate Committee of the Board determines that, as a result of fraud, misconduct, a restatement of our financial statements, or a significant write-off not in the ordinary course affecting our financial statements, an executive has received more compensation than would have otherwise been paid, the Board or Committee shall take action as it deems necessary or appropriate to address the events that gave rise to the fraud, misconduct, write-off or restatement and to prevent its recurrence. Such action may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, requiring partial or full reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid to the executive, causing the partial or full cancellation of equity awards, adjusting the future compensation of such executive, and dismissing or taking legal action against the executive, in 
PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 38 
 each case as the Board or Committee determines to be in the best interests of the Company. 
Role of the Committee in Executive Compensation: The role of the Committee is to discharge the Board's responsibilities relating to executive compensation matters. In this regard, the Committee is responsible for the development and administration of our executive compensation and benefits program, in furtherance of which the Committee has the authority and responsibility to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the CEO, to evaluate the performance  of the CEO in light of these goals and objectives, and determine and approve the compensation of the CEO based on this evaluation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    set senior executive compensation and make recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive compensation plans and  equity-based plans, administer and make awards under such plans and review the cumulative effect of its actions;

◾    monitor compliance by executives with the Companys share ownership requirements; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    review and assist the Board with the development of executive succession plans.  
[END TABLE]
In fulfilling these duties, the Committee is supported by our Senior Vice President, People & Culture and his department, the Committee's executive compensation consultant and other outside legal, financial and compensation counsel, where appropriate. 
Role of the CEO in Executive Compensation: Our CEO makes recommendations to the Committee with respect to the compensation of executive officers other than himself. The Committee reviews and discusses the compensation of these officers with the CEO, and the Committee makes the final compensation decisions with respect to these executive officers. The CEO makes no recommendation and has no role in setting any aspect of his own compensation; he does not attend any Committee meetings when any element of his compensation is discussed. 
Role of Compensation Consultants: During 2018, the Committee retained the services of Frederic W. Cook & Co., an independent compensation consulting firm, to advise the Committee with respect to the compensation of the CEO and other executives. In addition, Cook provided the Committee with input into the design of our compensation and benefit programs and evolving regulatory and executive compensation market trends. 
Consistent with the requirements of its charter, the Committee has reviewed and considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    the services the senior advisor of the Cook consulting team performed for the Committee during 2018;

◾    the quality and objectivity of the services provided to the Committee.  
[END TABLE]
Other than obtaining advice on executive and director compensation, the Company has no relationship with the senior advisor or his firm, and the Committee regards them as independent. 
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation: No member of the Committee at any time during 2018 had any relationship with the Company that would be required to be disclosed as a related person transaction or as a compensation committee interlock. 
Policy with Respect to Qualifying Compensation for Deductibility: Our ability to deduct compensation paid to individual officers who are covered by Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code is generally limited to $1.0 million annually. However, we do not expect any impact from Section 162(m) because none of our covered officers is or is currently expected to be on our U.S. payroll.

(3)   In addition to the benefits reflected in this column, we generally provide a survivor income benefit allowance, or SIB  allowance, to the surviving spouse and children of U.S. payroll-based employees who die while covered by our Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees. Following the death of a retiree who was married at the time of retirement and whose retirement  benefits are being paid as a single life annuity, the surviving spouse becomes entitled to a SIB allowance commencing four years after the retiree's death, in an amount equal to the amount the spouse would have received if the participant had  elected to receive monthly payments under the Retirement Plan in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity. The present value of the post-retirement SIB benefits for Mr. King, assuming his spouse  survives him, is $43,659. There is no SIB allowance under the BEP because the BEP benefit is only available as a lump sum.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    The surviving spouse of a participant who dies prior to retirement and prior to age 61 becomes entitled to receive 25%  of the base salary of the deceased employee commencing four years after the participant's death, provided the spouse has not remarried, and continuing until the deceased employee would have reached age 65. At that time, the surviving spouse  receives the same survivor benefit he or she would have received if the deceased employee continued to work until age 65 earning the same base salary as in effect at the time of death. These benefits are reduced by any death benefits payable from  the Retirement Plan. If there is no surviving spouse, SIB allowances for each child equal 10% of the base salary of the deceased employee (to a maximum of 30% of base salary), become payable monthly beginning four years after the employee's  death, and continue until the child reaches age 25 if a full-time student (age 19 if not).

Retirement Plans for U.S. Payroll-Based Employees 
Pensions for our U.S. payroll-based employees are payable from the tax-qualified Retirement Plan and non-qualified supplemental plans. These plans recognize the employees' prior service with companies with which we were previously affiliated. 
Mr. King, who is a former U.S. payroll-based employee, has accrued benefits under the tax-qualified Retirement Plan and the non-qualified supplemental Benefit Equalization Plan (BEP). The provisions of these two plans are described below. 
The BEP provides both supplemental pension benefits and supplemental deferred profit-sharing benefits. The provisions of the BEP relating to deferred profit-sharing benefits are described following the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table. 
Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees 
The tax-qualified Retirement Plan is a non-contributory plan maintained for the benefit of our U.S. payroll-based salaried employees hired before January 1, 2009. Subject to tax law limits, the pension formula generally applicable under the Retirement Plan provides for lifetime benefits following termination of employment equal to (a) 1.75% of the employee's average compensation (the sum of annual salary and annual incentive compensation award in the 60 consecutive months during the employee's last 120 months of service that, when divided by five, produces the highest average), minus (b) 0.30% of such compensation up to the applicable Social Security-covered compensation amount, times (c) years of credited service (up to a maximum of 35). Social Security-covered compensation is generally an amount equal to the average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for the 35-year period that ends in the year the participant reaches age 65. The resulting benefit is expressed as a single life annuity payable commencing at normal retirement age. 
Employees who terminate employment before age 55 with vested benefits may commence receiving payment of their accrued pensions after attaining age 55, with reductions for early commencement of 6% for each year by which commencement precedes age 65. For an employee who terminates employment after age 55, the reduction for early commencement is generally 6% for each year by which commencement precedes age 60. If an employee has 30 years of service and is age 55 or older, or is 60 or older with 5 years of service, the annuity immediately payable on early retirement is 100% of that payable at normal retirement age. 
Benefit Equalization Plan (BEP) 
The tax law applicable to the funded tax-qualified Retirement Plan limits the annual compensation that can be taken into account in determining the five-year average compensation under the plan. As a result of this and certain other tax limits, only a portion of the benefits calculated under the Retirement Plan formula can be paid to affected employees from the Retirement Plan. To compensate for the loss of these benefits under the funded tax-qualified plan, eligible employees accrue supplemental benefits under non-qualified plans. Generally, the supplemental pension benefits accrued under the BEP equal the difference between (a) the pension benefits determined under the Retirement Plan provisions described above, disregarding the tax law limits, and (b) the benefits that can be provided from the Retirement Plan after taking the tax law limits into account. 
Retirement Plans for Swiss Payroll-Based Employees 
Pensions for our Swiss payroll-based employees are payable from a funded defined benefit pension plan and incentive compensation (IC) pension plan qualifying for favorable treatment under Swiss law. To the extent that Swiss tax or other limitations do not allow paying the full pension under the qualified plans, the balance is expected to be payable under a supplemental pension plan. 
Pension Fund of Philip Morris in Switzerland 
With limited exceptions, all Swiss payroll-based employees over 25 years of age become immediately covered by the Pension Fund of Philip Morris in Switzerland, a broad-based contributory-funded plan providing defined retirement, disability and death benefits up to limits prescribed under Swiss law. Retirement benefits are expressed as an annuity at normal retirement age equal to 1.8% of the participant's five-year average pensionable salary (base salary minus two-thirds of the maximum social security benefits of CHF 28,200 in 2018) multiplied by years of credited service (to a maximum of 40 to 41 years, depending on the employee's date of birth). Effective April 1, 2015, employees between the ages of 25 and 34 contribute 6% of their pensionable salary to the Fund, and the contribution increases to 7% for employees between the ages of 35 and 54 and 8% for employees between the ages of 55 and 65. Subject to certain conditions, participants may elect to receive pension benefits entirely or partially in a lump sum. For determining lump sum values, a discount rate of 4% and the LPP 2015 mortality table are used. The LPP mortality table is a commonly used mortality table in Switzerland. For an employee who completes 30 years of service and retires at age 62, this translates into payments equivalent to a pension of 54% of five years' annual 
PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 48 
 average pensionable salary. For an employee with 40 years of credited service at age 65, this "replacement ratio" is approximately 72% of average salary. Participants may retire and commence benefits as early as age 58; however, for each year that retirement precedes age 62, the 1.8% multiplier used to calculate the amount of the retirement pension is reduced by 0.06% (at age 58 the multiplier is 1.56%). Swiss law permits participants in a pension plan to make additional voluntary contributions to the pension plan to compensate for missing years of credited service. 
If an employee terminates employment with us before age 58, the lump sum value of the pension calculated using the termination lump sum factors is transferred either to a new pension fund or to a blocked bank account until early retirement age is reached. An employee who is age 50 or over upon termination of employment can elect under certain conditions to remain in the plan as an external member. In this case, neither the employee nor the employer can contribute any further funds. At the age of 58, the former employee must then elect to take retirement in the form of an annuity, a lump sum or a mix of both. 
IC Pension Plan of Philip Morris in Switzerland 
Swiss payroll-based employees in salary grades 14 and above who are eligible to participate in the annual incentive compensation award program described above are also eligible to participate in the IC Pension Plan of Philip Morris in Switzerland, a funded plan which, for the named executive officers, provides for participant contributions of up to 1.5% of pensionable salary (as defined above), subject to maximum Swiss pension law limits, and an equal matching contribution from the employer. As with the pension plan, participants may make additional voluntary contributions subject to certain terms and conditions. 
Benefits ultimately received depend on interest rates set by the Pension Board of the plan (which consists of members appointed by the employer and an equal number selected by participants in the plan) and are payable in a lump sum or as an annuity. The plan guarantees that there is no loss of principal on either the employee contributions or the Company match. In 2018, the assets of the funds had a negative performance of 7.2%, and no interest was credited on plan balances. 
If an employee terminates employment with the Company before age 58, the employee's account value is transferred to either a new pension fund or to a blocked bank account until early retirement age is reached. An employee who is age 50 or over upon termination of employment can elect under certain conditions to remain in the plan as an external member. In this case, neither the employee nor the employer can contribute any further funds to the plan although interest does accrue on the account balance. At the age of 58, the former employee must then elect to take retirement in the form of an annuity, a lump sum payment or a mix of both. 
Supplemental Plan of Philip Morris in Switzerland 
For some Swiss payroll-based employees, including our NEOs, the laws and regulations applicable to the Pension Fund of Philip Morris in Switzerland and the IC Pension Plan of Philip Morris in Switzerland limit the benefits that can be provided under those plans. For these employees, we maintain a Supplemental Plan under which an amount is calculated and deposited annually in a Swiss foundation to make up for the difference between the full pension an employee would have received had these plans not been subject to such limitations (assuming the employee becomes entitled to benefits from the Supplemental Plan). However, the annual deposits do not serve to increase the amount that an individual would have received absent such limits. In determining the amount of the annual deposit, the actuarial assumptions used are the same as those described above for the Pension Fund of Philip Morris in Switzerland. 
In the event of a Supplemental Plan participant's termination of employment from the Company, if the Foundation Board determines in its sole discretion that he or she is entitled to a benefit, the Supplemental Plan benefit is paid in a lump sum at the time that benefits first become payable to the participant under the Pension Fund of Philip Morris in Switzerland and the IC Pension Plan of Philip Morris in Switzerland. As the Supplemental Plan is not a tax-qualified plan, the benefits from this plan, when paid, are adjusted for the loss of favorable tax-qualified plan treatment.

[END TABLE]
For U.S. payroll-based employees, we provide non-qualified defined contribution benefits supplementing the benefits provided under our tax-qualified Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan for Salaried Employees, or DPS. Under the DPS, contributions are made on behalf of each participant for each year. Currently, none of our named executive officers is eligible for DPS contributions. 
As is the case for the Retirement Plan, the applicable U.S. tax law limits the amount of compensation ($275,000 for 2018) that can be taken into account under the tax-qualified DPS for any year and imposes other limits on the amounts that can be allocated to individuals under the DPS. A DPS participant whose salary was more than the compensation limit or who was otherwise affected by tax law limits is entitled to a supplemental profit-sharing benefit in an amount generally equal to the additional benefits the participant would have received under the DPS but for the application of the tax law limits. 
The funds accumulated in the DPS portion of BEP for Mr. King reflect the contributions while he was a U.S. payroll-based employee. 
The DPS fund used as an earnings measure under this portion of the BEP is invested in a variety of high-quality fixed-income instruments with strong credit ratings and, for 2018, produced earnings at a rate of approximately 2.0%. Participants typically receive their supplemental profit-sharing benefits upon termination of employment in a lump sum or, if elected in advance, as a deferred lump sum payment or in installments over a number of years not to exceed their life expectancy.

Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements 
As a general matter, PMI has not utilized special employment contracts for its named executive officers. However, our Swiss payroll-based executive officers are covered by contracts, which do not include change in control provisions. 
Our 2018 equity compensation awards were granted under the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan. That plan includes a double-trigger feature. Under the plan, outstanding equity awards will not accelerate or vest if the entity acquiring PMI agrees to replace the award with a time-based equity award of equivalent value. For this purpose, the value of outstanding PSUs would be determined based on actual performance through the date of the change in control if more than one-half of the performance cycle has elapsed and such performance is determinable. Otherwise, the value of the outstanding PSUs will be based on the assumption that target performance had been achieved. If outstanding equity awards are not replaced, the outstanding RSUs would fully vest, and the value of outstanding PSUs would be determined as set forth above and both be payable immediately in cash. Fully earned but unpaid annual incentive compensation awards would become payable. 
If outstanding equity awards are replaced as described above but, within two years after the change in control, the employee's employment is terminated involuntarily and other than for cause or the employee terminates employment for good reason, the replacement awards would fully vest. 
Under PMI's 2017 Performance Incentive Plan, a change in control occurs: (i) upon an acquisition of 20% or more of either PMI's common stock or the voting power of PMI's voting securities, excluding certain acquisitions involving PMI or its affiliates or where PMI's beneficial owners continue to meet certain ownership thresholds; (ii) when members of the PMI Board as of the effective date of PMI's 2017 Performance Incentive Plan, or thereafter nominated or elected by such members, cease to constitute a majority of the PMI Board; (iii) upon certain reorganizations, mergers, share exchanges and consolidations involving PMI; or (iv) upon the liquidation or dissolution, or sale of substantially all of the assets of PMI, with limited exceptions. 
Our 2016 and 2017 equity compensation awards were granted under PMI's 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, which also includes a double-trigger feature. Under that plan, the changes to vest or pay applicable awards occur immediately upon a change in control only if the entity acquiring PMI does not agree to assume or replace the awards. In addition, if the acquiring entity agrees to assume or replace the awards, but an employee's employment is terminated involuntarily and other than for cause or the employee terminates employment for good reason within two years after the change in control, the applicable awards will become vested or be payable upon the employee's termination of employment as follows:

The definition of change in control in the 2012 Plan is similar to that in the 2017 Plan. 
The amounts in the accompanying table are estimates of the amounts that would have become payable on a change in control of PMI, calculated as if a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018, applying certain assumptions. For outstanding equity awards granted under the 2012 Performance Incentive Plan, we have assumed that the awards become vested and payable as of December 31, 2018, either because the acquirer did not assume or replace the awards or because the employee's employment was involuntarily terminated. For outstanding equity awards granted under the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan and annual cash incentive awards, we have assumed that the outstanding awards became vested and payable as of December 31, 2018, because they were not replaced by the acquirer or employment was involuntarily terminated.

Benefits payable under PMI's qualified pension and profit-sharing plans and supplemental plans are discussed above. None of those plans provides PMI's executive officers with an additional enhancement, early vesting or other benefit in the event of a change in control or termination of employment, except for certain plan provisions applicable to all plan participants that ensure vesting and continuation of profit-sharing contributions for the year of a change in control and the following two years. Mr. King is already fully vested under these plans. Similarly, no enhanced provisions apply to the above-named executive officers with respect to continued medical, life insurance or other insurance coverage following termination of employment, whether or not in connection with a change in control. 
Involuntary Separation Without Cause 
In the event of involuntary separation without cause, a severance payment is typically determined as a multiple of monthly base salary. The amount of severance paid varies based on a number of factors, including the circumstances of the termination and the executive's years of service. 
Voluntary Early Retirement or Retirement 
In the event of voluntary early retirement or retirement, a retirement allowance is typically determined based on the annual base salary midpoint for the executive's grade. The amount varies based on a number of factors, including the circumstances of retirement and the executive's years of service.

Pay Ratio 
About Our Workforce 
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 77,400 people worldwide. As our manufacturing and sales activities are outside of the U.S., 99.8% of our employees (or approximately 77,240) are located outside of the U.S. Approximately 67% of our employees are located in non-OECD countries, which tend to be lesser developed countries with lower wages than OECD countries. Approximately 35% of our workforce is in Indonesia. The national average annual net salary is approximately $2,400 in that country.(1) Approximately 65% of our overall workforce is covered by collective labor agreements, and approximately 78% of our workforce in non-OECD countries is covered by collective labor agreements. 
Our Pay Ratio 
Given our global footprint, and in accordance with the regulatory guidance, we have determined that the cost-of-living adjusted ratio based on the purchasing power parity index (or PPP) reflects the differences in the living and economic conditions of approximately 90 countries where our employees reside.(2) The PPP conversion factor represents the number of units of local currency that can buy a basket of goods that 1 CHF would buy in Switzerland, where our CEO resides. The total PPP-adjusted compensation for our median employee residing in Indonesia is approximately CHF 49,875.(3) Comparing this employee's total PPP-adjusted compensation to the total compensation of our CEO in 2018, our adjusted pay ratio is 308:1.(4) 
Had we not used the PPP adjustment, our median employee's total 2018 compensation would have been approximately $18,890. Comparing this employee's total compensation to the total compensation of our CEO set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 41, the ratio would be 843:1. For reference, the ratio of the CEO's total compensation to that of our median employee in Switzerland is 83:1.At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 3,235 people in Switzerland, including approximately 310 in our factory and 750 in our R&D facility in Neuchâtel. 
PMI as an Employer 
We are the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation. 
This year, the Top Employer Institute recognized us as a Global Top Employer for the third consecutive year. Additionally, we have been awarded Top Employer Middle East 2019, Top Employer Africa 2019, Top Employer Europe 2019, Top Employer North America 2019, and Top Employer Latin America 2019. The Top Employer Institute also granted us a Top Employer certification in 49 countries worldwide, including Indonesia.

53• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section discusses in detail how our compensation programs support our business and financial objectives, how they work and are administered under the direction of our independent Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, and how the Committee's decisions concerning the 2018 compensation of our executive officers were directly tied to our performance. 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This annual say-on-pay vote gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our shareholders to vote 
 "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures. 
This say-on-pay vote is advisory and, therefore, not binding on the Company, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee or the Board of Directors. The Board and the Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will review the voting results when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers.

Audit Committee Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2018 
To Our Shareholders: 
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal accounting control. The Audit Committee monitors the Company's financial reporting processes and systems of internal accounting control, the independence and the performance of the independent auditors, and the performance of the internal auditors. The Audit Committee has the sole authority for appointing, compensating and overseeing the work of the independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee has received representations from management that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors, including in executive sessions without the presence of management, the independent auditors' evaluation of the accounting principles, practices and judgments applied by management, the adequacy of the Company's financial reporting processes, controls and procedures, and the Audit Committee has discussed any items required to be communicated to it by the independent auditors in accordance with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Independence Standards Board. 
The Audit Committee has received from the independent auditors written disclosures and a letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning their independence and has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from the Company and its management. The Audit Committee has pre-approved all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and the fees for those services. As part of this process, the Audit Committee has reviewed the audit fees of the independent auditors. It has also reviewed non-audit services and fees to assure compliance with regulations prohibiting the independent auditors from performing specified services that might impair their independence, as well as compliance with the Company's and the Audit Committee's policies. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and independent auditors the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee has met with the internal auditors and the independent auditors, separately and together, with and without management present, to discuss the Company's financial reporting processes and internal control over financial reporting and overall control environment. The Audit Committee has reviewed significant audit findings prepared by the independent auditors and those prepared by the internal auditors, together with management's responses. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Pre-Approval Policy 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of service and is subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee requires the independent auditors to report on the actual fees charged for each category of service at Audit Committee meetings throughout the year. 
During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent auditors for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee for those instances when pre-approval is needed prior to a scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The Chair of the Audit Committee must report on such approvals at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. 
PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 56 
The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers SA ("PwC") as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and has directed that management submit the selection of independent auditors to shareholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In determining to reappoint PwC, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    PwC has served as the Companys independent auditors since we became an independent company in 2008;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The results of the Audit Committees evaluation of PwCs qualifications, performance, independence and quality  control procedures;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The appropriateness of PwCs fees.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholder ratification of the selection of PwC as the Company's independent auditors is not required by the Company's by-laws or otherwise. However, we are submitting the selection of PwC to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent audit firm at any time during the year if it is determined that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the selection of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers SA as the Company's independent auditors. 
57• PMI 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Board has adopted a policy, which is available on the Company's website, at www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us, that requires our executive officers, directors and nominees for director to promptly notify the Corporate Secretary in writing of any transaction in which (i) the amount exceeds $120,000; (ii) the Company is, was or is proposed to be a participant; and (iii) such person or such person's immediate family members ("Related Persons") has, had or may have a direct or indirect material interest (a "Related Person Transaction"). The Corporate Secretary, in consultation with outside counsel, to the extent appropriate, shall determine whether a potential transaction with a Related Person constitutes a Related Person Transaction requiring review under the policy (including whether the Company or the Related Person has a material interest, based on a review of all facts and circumstances). If the Corporate Secretary determines that the proposed transaction constitutes a Related Person Transaction or it would be beneficial to further review the transaction, then, in either case, the transaction will be referred to the CEO or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board. In deciding whether to approve or ratify the Related Person Transaction, the reviewer is required to consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Based on the review of such facts and circumstances, the reviewer will approve, ratify or disapprove the Related Person Transaction. The reviewer will approve or ratify a Related Person Transaction only if it is determined that the transaction is not opposed to the best interests of the Company. All determinations by the CEO and Corporate Secretary must be reported to the Committee at its next meeting. In addition to this policy, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors (the "Director Code"), which is available on our website, at www.pmi.com/our-business/about-us, has specific provisions addressing actual and potential conflicts of interest. The Director Code specifies: "Our directors have an obligation to act in the best interest of the Company. All directors should endeavor to avoid situations that present a potential or actual conflict between their interest and the interest of the Company." The Director Code defines conflict of interest to include any instance in which (i) a person's private interest interferes in any way, or even appears to interfere, with the interest of the Company, including its subsidiaries and affiliates; (ii) a director or a director's family member takes an action or has an interest that may make it difficult for that director to perform his or her work objectively and effectively; and (iii) a director (or his or her family member) receives improper personal benefits as a result of the director's position in the Company. 
Similarly, our policies require all officers and employees of the Company to avoid situations where the officer's or employee's personal, financial or political activities have the potential of interfering with his or her loyalty and objectivity to the Company.

5.  WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT I CAN USE TO VOTE MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  In Writing: All shareholders of record can vote by mailing their completed and signed proxy card (in the case of  registered shareholders) or their completed and signed voting instruction form (in the case of street name holders).

Street name holders of record may vote by  telephone or Internet if their brokers or banks make those methods available. If that is the case, each broker or bank will enclose instructions with the proxy statement. The telephone and Internet voting procedures, including the use of control  numbers, are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to vote their shares, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Proxies submitted by Internet or telephone must be received by 11:59  p.m., EDT, on April 30, 2019.

[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  WHAT ARE THE CHOICES WHEN VOTING ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS SA AS THE  COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, AND WHAT VOTE IS NEEDED TO RATIFY THEIR SELECTION?  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders may:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  vote against the ratification; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

11.  WHAT IF A SHAREHOLDER DOES NOT SPECIFY A CHOICE FOR A MATTER WHEN RETURNING A PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders should specify their choice for each matter on the enclosed proxy. If no specific instructions are given, proxies that are signed and returned will be voted "FOR" the election of all director nominees, "FOR" the advisory say-on-pay resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers, and "FOR" the proposal to ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers SA as the Company's independent auditors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE?

PMI 2019 Proxy Statement• 62 
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE PROXY CARD?  
[END TABLE]
It means that you have multiple accounts with brokers and/or our transfer agent. Please vote all of these shares. We recommend that you contact your broker and/or our transfer agent to consolidate as many accounts as possible under the same name and address. Our transfer agent is Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078 or you can reach Computershare at 1-877-745-9350 (from within the United States or Canada) or 1-781-575-4310 (from outside the United States or Canada), or via e-mail at pmi@computershare.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  WILL MY SHARES BE VOTED IF I DO NOT PROVIDE MY PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a street name holder of shares, you should have received a voting instruction form with the proxy statement sent from your broker or bank. Your shares held in street name may be voted only on certain "routine" matters when you do not provide your broker or bank with voting instructions. For example, the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers SA as independent auditors of the Company is considered a "routine" matter for which brokers or banks may vote uninstructed shares. When a proposal is not a "routine" matter (such as the election of director nominees and say-on-pay advisory votes) and the broker or bank has not received voting instructions from the street name holder with respect to that proposal, that broker or bank cannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is called a broker non-vote. Therefore, it is important that you provide instructions to your broker or bank with respect to your vote on these "non-routine" matters. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  ARE ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES COUNTED?  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions will not be included in the vote totals for any matter. Broker non-votes will not be included in vote totals and will not affect the outcome of the vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  MAY SHAREHOLDERS ASK QUESTIONS AT THE MEETING?  
[END TABLE]
Yes. The Chairman will answer shareholders' questions of general interest during a designated portion of the meeting. In order to provide an opportunity for everyone who wishes to speak, shareholders will be limited to two minutes. Shareholders may speak a second time only after all others who wish to speak have had their turn. When speaking, shareholders must direct questions and comments to the Chairman and confine their remarks to matters that relate directly to the business of the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.  HOW MANY VOTES MUST BE PRESENT TO HOLD THE MEETING?  
[END TABLE]
Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you attend the meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy by Internet, telephone or mail. In order for us to conduct our meeting, a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of March 8, 2019, must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions and shares of record held by a broker, bank or other agent ("Broker Shares") that are voted on any matter are included in determining the number of votes present. Broker Shares that are not voted on any matter will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present.
