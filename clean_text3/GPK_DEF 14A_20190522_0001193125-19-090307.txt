Proxy Statement for the 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders on 
May 22, 2019 
General Information 
ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING INFORMATION 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") of Graphic Packaging Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Company's offices, located at 1500 Riveredge Parkway, Suite 100, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, on Wednesday, May 22, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. local time (the "Annual Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card or notice of availability on the Internet will first be sent on or before March 28, 2019 to the Company's stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 25, 2019 (the "Record Date"). References in this Proxy Statement to "Graphic Packaging," "GPHC," "we," "us," and "our" or similar terms are to Graphic Packaging Holding Company. 
Outstanding Shares 
As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 295,587,458 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to come before the Annual Meeting. 
Who May Vote 
Only stockholders who held shares of the Company's common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
How to Vote in Person 
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered a stockholder of record and you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If your shares are registered through a bank or brokerage firm, your shares are considered to be held beneficially in street name. If your shares are held beneficially in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from the bank or brokerage firm that holds your shares. Please note that even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, the Company recommends that you vote before the Annual Meeting. 
How to Vote by Proxy 
Whether you hold shares directly as a stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by any of the methods described below. If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee. For directions on how to vote, please refer to the instructions below and those included on your proxy card or, for shares held beneficially in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your bank or brokerage firm. 
General Information 
Voting over the Internet. Stockholders of record of the Company's common stock with Internet access may submit proxies by following the "Vote by Internet" instructions on their proxy cards. In addition, most of the Company's stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may vote by accessing the website specified on the voting instruction card provided by their bank or brokerage firm. Please check the voting instruction card to determine Internet voting availability. 
Voting by Telephone. Stockholders of record of the Company's common stock may submit proxies by following the "Vote by Phone" instructions on their proxy cards. Most of the Company's stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may vote by phone by calling the number specified on the voting instruction card provided by their bank or brokerage firm. Please check the voting instruction card to determine telephone voting availability. 
Voting by Mail. Stockholders of record of the Company's common stock may submit proxies by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope. The Company's stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the voting instruction card provided by their bank or brokerage firm and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope. 
How Proxies Work 
The Board of Directors is asking for your proxy. By giving the Board your proxy, your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. If you do not specify how you wish to vote your shares, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of each of the Director nominees, "FOR" the approval of the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and "FOR" the proposal to approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers. The proxyholders will vote shares according to their discretion on any other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. 
If for any reason any nominee for election as Director is unable or declines to serve as a Director, discretionary authority may be exercised by the proxyholders to vote for a substitute proposed by the Board. 
If the shares you own are held beneficially in street name by a bank or brokerage firm, such firm, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. To vote your shares, you will need to follow the directions your bank or brokerage firm provides to you. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), if you do not give instructions to your bank or brokerage firm, it will still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain "discretionary" items, but will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain "non-discretionary" items. In the case of non-discretionary items, the shares will be treated as "broker non-votes." Banks and brokerage firms are allowed to exercise discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions only with respect to Proposal 2 set forth in this Proxy Statement and not with respect to any other proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
How to Vote Your 401(k) Plan Shares 
If you participate in the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan or in the Company's Hourly 401(k) Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plans"), you may give voting instructions as to the number of share equivalents held in your account as of the Record Date to the trustee of the 401(k) Plans. You provide voting instructions to the trustee, Fidelity Management Trust Company, by completing and returning the proxy card accompanying this Proxy Statement. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your duly executed instructions if received by 12:00 midnight on May 19, 2019. If you do not send instructions, the trustee will not vote the number of share equivalents credited to your account. 
You may also revoke voting instructions previously given to the trustee by filing either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed proxy card bearing a later date with the trustee no later than 12:00 midnight on May 19, 2019. Your voting instructions will be kept confidential by the trustee. 
Quorum 
In order to carry out the business of the Annual Meeting, there must be a quorum. This means that at least a majority of the outstanding shares eligible to vote must be represented at the Annual Meeting, either by proxy or in person. Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of votes present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present. 
General Information 
Votes Needed 
The Director nominees receiving the largest number of votes cast are elected, up to the maximum number of Directors fixed by the Board to be elected at the Annual Meeting. As a result, any shares not voted, whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise, have no effect on the election of Directors, except to the extent that the failure to vote for a particular nominee may result in another nominee receiving a larger number of votes. However, under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, a nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than "for" is expected to tender his or her resignation to the Board promptly following certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any resignation tendered under this policy and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it. The Board will act on such resignation within 90 days following the certification of election results. A Director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation or in the Board's decision regarding whether to accept such resignation. Approval of Proposals 2 and 3 requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter at the Annual Meeting. An abstention with respect to these matters will have the effect of a vote against such proposal and broker non-votes will have no effect, as broker non-votes are not treated as shares entitled to vote. 
Changing Your Vote 
Shares of the Company's common stock represented by proxy will be voted as directed unless the proxy is revoked. Any proxy may be revoked before it is exercised by sending an instrument revoking the proxy or a proxy bearing a later date to the Company's Corporate Secretary. Any notice of revocation should be sent to: Graphic Packaging Holding Company, 1500 Riveredge Parkway, Suite 100, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Any proxy submitted over the Internet or by telephone may also be revoked by submitting a new proxy over the Internet or by telephone. A proxy is also revoked if the person who executed the proxy is present at the Annual Meeting and elects to vote in person. 
Attending in Person 
Only stockholders, their designated proxies and guests of the Company may attend the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held beneficially in street name, you must bring an account statement or letter from your brokerage firm or bank showing that you are the beneficial owner of shares of the Company's common stock as of the Record Date in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting.

Mr. Scarborough joined the Board on July 27, 2018 and Ms. Brlas joined the Board on January 11, 2019. 
Q.        How does Graphic Packaging determine which Directors are independent? 
A.        For purposes of this Proxy Statement, "independent" and "independence" have the meanings set forth under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the rules and regulations adopted thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE, and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, all as in effect from time to time. A Director will not qualify as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the Director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). In addition, in accordance with the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE, the Company will also apply the following standards in determining whether a Director is independent: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Director who is an employee of the Company, or whose immediate family member serves as one of the Company's  executive officers, may not be deemed independent until three years after the end of such employment relationship.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Director who receives, or whose immediate family member receives, more than $120,000 per year in direct compensation  from the Company, other than Board and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), may not be deemed independent until three  years after he or she ceases to receive more  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance Matters 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Director who is a partner or employee of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor or whose  immediate family member is a partner of such a firm or is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the Company's audit may not be deemed independent until three years after the end of the affiliation or the employment or  auditing relationship.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Director who is employed, or whose immediate family member is employed, as an executive officer of another company where  any of the Company's current executive officers at the same time serve on that company's compensation committee may not be deemed independent until three years after the end of such service or the employment relationship.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Director who is an employee, or whose immediate family member is an executive officer of a company that makes payments  to, or receives payments from the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any single fiscal year, exceeds the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other entity's consolidated gross revenues, may not be deemed independent  until three years after falling below that threshold.  
[END TABLE]
Applying these standards, the Board of Directors determined that all of the Company's Directors who served in 2018 were independent, except Mr. Doss. Mr. Doss is not considered independent because he serves as an executive officer of the Company. The Board of Directors has also determined that Ms. Brlas, who joined the Board in early 2019, is independent. 
Q.        What is the leadership structure of the Board of Directors? 
A.        Pursuant to the Company's By-Laws, the Chairman of the Board of Directors is elected from time to time by the members of the Board of Directors. The By-Laws do not require, and the Board of Directors does not have a specific policy with respect to, the separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. The By-Laws provide that the Chairman of the Board shall preside over each meeting of the stockholders of the Company and the Board of Directors and may have other duties and powers as conferred upon the Chairman by the Board of Directors. In accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, if the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer, the independent directors are required to elect one independent director to serve as Lead Director. The Lead Director is responsible for, among other duties, assisting the Chairman in providing Board leadership and presiding over the regular executive sessions of the Board at which non-management Directors meet without management participation. 
Mr. Philip A. Martens was elected by the Board to serve as Chairman on May 25, 2016 and has served as Chairman since that time. The Board believes that having an independent Board member serve as Chairman currently is in the best interests of stockholders. The Board believes that separating the roles of the Chairman and CEO is beneficial in part because it provides additional resources for managing the Board's functions, as well as experienced, independent oversight of management. In general, our Chairman of the Board will work with our CEO and other Board members to determine the Board's strategic priorities, while the CEO will be responsible for communicating the Board's guidance to management and implementing the Company's key strategic initiatives. 
Q.        What is the Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight? 
A.        As set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board is responsible for reviewing, approving and monitoring business strategies and financial performance, and ensuring processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the Company in financial reporting, legal and ethical compliance matters, and in relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, the community and stockholders. The Board fulfills these responsibilities through a number of different practices, including the approval of each annual operating plan and long-term strategic plan, the review of actual results against such plans at each regular Board meeting, and specific review and approval of significant corporate actions such as acquisitions and divestitures, plant rationalizations and major projects involving significant capital spending. In addition, the Board oversees areas of particular risk through its Audit Committee and its Compensation and Management Development Committee, each of which provides a report to the full Board of Directors at each regular Board meeting. 
Pursuant to its Charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements, the performance of the Company's internal audit function and the 
Corporate Governance Matters 
Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. To fulfill these responsibilities, the Audit Committee routinely discusses and evaluates (i) audit findings and issues with the Company's Chief Financial Officer and independent auditors, (ii) internal controls, processes and issues with the Company's Vice President of Internal Audit and Chief Audit Executive (who reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chief Financial Officer), and (iii) legal and regulatory compliance issues with the Company's Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. The Committee also periodically reviews and evaluates the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussion of the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. In addition to these activities, the Audit Committee reviews each of the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and has the opportunity to discuss such reports with management of the Company and the Company's independent auditors prior to the filing of such reports with the SEC. 
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for any risks inherent in the structure of the Company's compensation programs for its employees. Pursuant to its Charter, the Compensation and Management Development Committee reviews and approves the Company's general compensation philosophy, incentive and equity compensation plans, health and welfare plan offerings and retirement and savings plans for all employees. In addition, the Compensation and Management Development Committee reviews and approves all compensation arrangements and awards relating to the Company's executive officers, with all compensation arrangements of the President and CEO of the Company being reviewed and approved for recommendation to the full Board of Directors for final approval. Through its review of these programs and arrangements, the Compensation and Management Development Committee and the Board has visibility into and exercises oversight over the financial and other risks, such as retention of key management and ability to recruit necessary talent, affected by the Company's compensation and benefits programs. 
Q.        Did any of the Company's Directors attend fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board and their assigned committees? 
A.        All of the Company's then serving Directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and their assigned committees during 2018. 
Q.        What is the Company's policy on Director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders? 
A.        Directors are expected to attend each annual meeting of stockholders, but are not required to do so. All of the Company's then serving Directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Q.        Do the non-management Directors meet during the year in executive session? 
A.        Yes, the non-management Directors met separately at regularly scheduled executive sessions during 2018 without any member of management being present. Mr. Martens, as Chairman, acted as the presiding Director at each executive session held by the Board. 
Q.        Can stockholders and other interested parties communicate directly with the Directors of Graphic Packaging or with the non-management Directors of Graphic Packaging? 
A.        Yes. If you wish to communicate with the Board or any individual Director, you may send correspondence to Graphic Packaging Holding Company, 1500 Riveredge Parkway, Suite 100, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The Corporate Secretary will submit your correspondence to the Board, the appropriate committee or the appropriate Director, as applicable. You may also communicate directly with the Chairman of the Board or the non-management Directors as a group by sending correspondence to Graphic Packaging Holding Company, 1500 Riveredge Parkway, Suite 100, Atlanta, Georgia, Attention: Chairman of the Board. 
Q.        What does the Audit Committee do?

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Board recognizes that Related Party Transactions (as defined below) can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that Company decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. In March 2007, the Board of Graphic Packaging Corporation (the publicly-traded predecessor to the Company, "GPC") delegated authority to the Audit Committee to review and approve Related Party Transactions, and the Audit Committee has adopted a Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions. 
The Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions defines a "Related Party Transaction" as any transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which (a) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (b) the Company is a participant, and (c) any Related Party (as defined below) has or will have a direct or indirect interest, other than an interest that arises solely as a result of being a director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of another entity. The policy defines a "Related Party" as any (a) person who is or was since the beginning of the last fiscal year an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director of the Company, (b) any beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's common stock, (c) an immediate family member of any of the foregoing, or (d) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing is employed, is a principal or serves in a similar position, or has a beneficial ownership of more than 5%. 
The Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions provides that the Audit Committee shall review all of the material facts and circumstances of all Related Party Transactions and either approve, ratify or disapprove of the entry into the Related Party Transaction. In determining whether to approve a Related Party Transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the Related Party Transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances, the benefits to the Company, the extent of the Related Party's interest in the transaction, and if the Related Party is a director or a nominee for director, the impact on such director's independence. The policy provides that certain Related Party Transactions, including certain charitable contributions, transactions involving competitive bids and transactions in which all stockholders receive proportional benefits, are pre-approved and do not require an individual review by the Audit Committee. You may find a copy of the Policy Regarding Related Party Transactions on the Company's website at www.graphicpkg.com in the Investors section under Corporate Governance.

CRITERIA FOR POTENTIAL DIRECTORS 
The Company's Board is responsible for selecting nominees for election as Directors by stockholders and for filling vacancies on the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the Board individuals for nomination as members of the Board and its committees and, in this regard, reviewing with the Board on an annual basis the current skills, background and expertise of the members of the Board, as well as the Company's future and ongoing needs. This assessment is used to establish criteria for identifying and evaluating potential candidates for the Board. However, as a general matter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks individuals with significant and relevant business experience who demonstrate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the highest personal and professional integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• commitment to driving the Company's success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an ability to provide informed and thoughtful counsel on a range of issues; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• exceptional ability and judgment.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a specific diversity policy used in identifying nominees for director. As described above, however, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses the skills, background and expertise of the members of the Board and identifies the Company's needs. As part of this process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to select nominees with relevant business 
Proposal 1 — Election of Directors experience, the personal characteristics described above and a wide variety of skills and viewpoints. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also recognizes the importance of selecting directors from a range of backgrounds and professions to provide the Board a wealth of experiences and perspectives to inform its decisions and enhance its cognitive diversity. Consistent with this philosophy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the ability of a potential director to contribute to the Board by leveraging a broad range of experiences, as well as the potential director's ethnic, gender, generational and racial diversity. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates recommended by its members and other Directors, as well as those identified by a third-party search firm retained to assist in identifying candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider whether to nominate any person recommended by a stockholder pursuant to the provisions of the Company's By-Laws relating to stockholder nominations as described in "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the same criteria to evaluate proposed nominees that are recommended by Directors or a search firm as it does for stockholder-recommended nominees. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
Annually the Company benchmarks the amount and type of compensation paid to its non-management Directors against that paid by other companies in the Industry Specific Peer Group used for comparing executive officer compensation (as described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Peer Group and Market Data"), as well as against a large published survey of non-employee director compensation across a wide range of industries and company sizes. The goal is to set non-management Director compensation at roughly the mid-point of compensation paid by companies of similar size in similar industries. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the benchmarking materials and approves and recommends all non-management Director compensation changes for approval by the full Board of Directors. 
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation of the non-employee Directors of the Company in 2018.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
This report by the Audit Committee is required by the rules of the SEC. It is not to be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement that incorporates by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and it is not to be otherwise deemed filed under either such Act. 
The Audit Committee is currently comprised of five members, each of whom is an "independent director," as defined by Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Each of the members of the Audit Committee is financially literate and qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under federal securities laws. The Audit Committee's purposes are to assist the Board in overseeing: (a) the quality and integrity of our financial statements; (b) the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and (c) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed with audit committees by the Statement on  Auditing Standards No. 16, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T; and

 Total     $  5.1        $  4.1    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. This category includes the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, for the reviews of the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q during 2018 and 2017, and for services that are normally provided by the independent auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the relevant fiscal years. 
Audit Matters 
Audit-Related Fees. This category includes the aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for assurance and related services by the independent auditors that are reasonably related to the performance of the audits or reviews of the financial statements and are not reported above under "Audit Fees," and generally consist of fees for accounting consultation and audits of employee benefit plans. 
Tax Fees. This category includes the aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the independent auditors for tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. 
All Other Fees. This category includes the aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the independent auditors that are not reported above under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees," or "Tax Fees." 
The Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent auditors as well as the fees charged for such services. The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services by Ernst & Young LLP is compatible with maintaining the firm's independence. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority for such services to one or more members, whose decisions are then presented to the full Audit Committee at its scheduled meetings. In 2018 and 2017, all of the audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter. 
Proposal 2 — Ratification of the 
Appointment of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has evaluated the qualifications, performance and independence of Ernst & Young LLP and has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Ernst & Young has served as the Company's registered public accounting firm continuously since 2008. To assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a rotation of the independent external audit firm. Further, in connection with the mandated rotation of the audit firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chair were directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner. Although the Company is not required to submit the appointment of its independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders for ratification, the Board of Directors believes that it is important to do so as a matter of good corporate governance. This proposal asks you to ratify this selection. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. In addition, they will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee has sole and direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Company. The Audit Committee will consider the results of the stockholder vote on ratification, but will exercise its judgment, consistent with its responsibilities under its charter, with respect to the appointment and retention of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Additionally, the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP will be subject to the Audit Committee and Ernst & Young LLP reaching agreement on satisfactory terms of the engagement. 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

Executive Summary 
Our compensation programs reflect our commitment to pay for performance and align the interests of our key employees with those of our stockholders. Executive compensation plans are designed to support the Company's annual financial goals and promote stockholder value creation over the long term. In addition, they are intended to attract, retain, motivate and reward those responsible for leading our business. A significant portion of the compensation packages of our Executives is intended to be at-risk pay for performance earned based on specific financial and operational achievements. During 2018, the Company was successful in: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• increasing Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA1 by 36.8% and 36.3%,  respectively, through strategic acquisitions, improved volumes and mix and successfully offsetting input cost inflation through the implementation of price increases and performance improvements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• completing the successful integration of the transformative combination with International Paper Company's North  America Consumer Packaging business, establishing the Company as a leader in the growing foodservice market and positioning the Company for future growth;

Throughout 2018, our compensation program performed as designed, allowing the Company to attract new talent, retain important members of management and reward key members of management appropriately for performance. As demonstrated below, the aggregate total compensation of our five most highly paid executives for each of the past five years (as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table each year, but excluding changes in pension value and above-market non-qualified deferred compensation earnings, "Top Five Compensation") is generally aligned with the performance and value of the Company as reflected in the price of its common stock at year end. Aggregate total compensation of our five most-highly paid executives also reflects the retirement of David W. Scheible as President and CEO and Mr. Doss' promotion into that role as of January 1, 2016, which reduced aggregate compensation of our top five executives significantly in 2016 and 2017. The drop in stock price in 2018 reflects a period of intense stock market volatility at 2018 year end.

Guiding Principles and Policies 
The Committee's objective is to set each of the primary components of the Company's executive compensation program, (base salary, short-term cash incentive and long-term equity-based incentives), at a market-competitive rate, which is determined by reference to the 50th percentile of the relevant peer group, resulting in each Executive's total compensation opportunity being set at approximately the 50th percentile of the relevant peer group's total pay for executives with similar positions and responsibilities. The Committee does not employ a mechanical process based on external compensation data, however, as other considerations such as time in position, tenure, position and succession with the Company are considered. As data for the relevant peer group fluctuates or the peer group members are updated to reflect changes in the market, the Committee may make adjustments in one or more components of compensation to more closely align with market. The Committee and, with respect to the President and CEO, the Board of Directors, have full discretion to choose the elements of executive compensation that the Executives will be paid or will be eligible to earn each year and to adjust the proportion of total compensation opportunity that each element provides. Company performance, market data, individual performance, executive succession, retention needs and internal equity among our Executives' compensation packages have been the primary factors considered in decisions to change compensation materially. 
Peer Group and Market Data 
Annually we obtain an analysis of compensation market data to assist in setting pay opportunities for our Executives for the following year. Compensation of the Executives is compared to the pay opportunities provided to executives holding comparable positions at companies with which we compete for business and for talent. The companies used for this comparison are recommended by the Company and the Committee's compensation consultant and approved by the Committee. The companies selected and shown below under the Industry Specific Peer Group heading consist of a group of public companies with revenues approximately one-half to double the revenues of the Company or its immediate competitors. The Industry Specific Peer Group had median revenues of approximately $5.9 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 and a median market cap of approximately $6.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 and served as the primary reference point for comparing the compensation paid to the Company's President and CEO and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 2018. The Survey Peer Group, comprised of a broader set of industrial companies, had median revenues of $6.0 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2017 and a median market cap of $8.8 billion as of March 31, 2017 and served in 2018 as the primary reference point for executive officers other than the President and CEO and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Both peer groups are reviewed annually and updated, if necessary, to ensure their appropriateness given any market changes. The companies used to develop 2018 executive compensation are listed below.

Role of the Compensation and Management Development Committee 
The Committee is responsible for establishing the Company's general compensation philosophy and working with management to develop all equity compensation plans or programs and other compensation programs in which the 
Compensation Matters executive officers participate. The Committee works to ensure that the Company's practices, policies and programs link pay to performance, encourage an appropriate degree of risk taking, are consistent with the Company's talent objectives of attracting, retaining, rewarding and motivating key employees, and align the interests of key employees with those of stakeholders. Annually the Committee reviews the Company's compensation programs and assesses whether any risks arising from such practices, policies and programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, annually the Committee reviews market data provided by the Committee's compensation consultant, reviews and approves all of the compensation arrangements of the Company's executive officers, and directs the Board's process for evaluating the performance and compensation of the President and CEO. From time to time the Committee also reviews, evaluates and approves the Company's health and welfare plan offerings and the Company's retirement and savings plans to ensure their alignment with the market, effectiveness in attracting and retaining talent and cost effectiveness. 
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Company's integrated talent management processes to assess the success of these programs in facilitating the Company's short and long-term objectives. The Committee directs the annual succession planning process for executive officers and facilitates the Board's review and approval of the President and CEO's succession plan. The Committee also annually reviews compliance with executive shareholding requirements and monitors any application of the Company's clawback policy. 
Role of Compensation Consultants 
The Committee retained Meridian to act as the Committee's independent advisor on executive compensation and benefits throughout 2018. The mandate of the compensation consultant is to work for the Committee in its review of executive compensation practices and programs, including assessing the overall competitiveness of pay levels and program design, and providing updates on market trends and technical considerations. The Committee instructed the compensation consultant to compile and provide data on both total pay and individual elements of compensation among companies in the peer groups, as well as trends in compensation practices that they observed within the peer groups and generally among public companies. The Committee does not rely on the compensation consultant to recommend specific levels of total pay or any specific element of compensation to our Executives; such recommendations are developed by management based on information provided by the compensation consultant and then presented to the Committee for consideration. The compensation consultant attended all of the six Committee meetings in 2018 at the Committee's request and were available to provide information to the Committee as questions and issues arose. The Committee completes an assessment of the compensation consultant annually. The Committee determined that the compensation consultant is independent after consideration of the SEC's independence factors. 
Role of Executive Officers 
The President and CEO and Executive Vice President, Human Resources recommend to the Committee the compensation program design and award amounts for the Executives (other than themselves). The Committee works with the compensation consultant to propose the compensation design and award amounts for the President and CEO. 
Compensation Matters 
Pay and Performance 
As noted above, target compensation for each of our Executives is established at the beginning of each year with reference to the 50th percentile of the relevant peer group. Each Executive's actual compensation each year may be above or below the target level based on individual, business unit and overall Company performance, as well as changes in the price of the Company's common stock. The chart below illustrates the relationship between the Top Five Compensation and the Company's Adjusted EBITDA and also reflects the retirement of David Scheible as President and CEO and Mr. Doss' promotion into that role as of January 1, 2016, which reduced aggregate compensation of our top five executives significantly in 2016 and 2017. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of its incentive plans as consolidated net income before equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries, interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for: expenses related to merger, acquisition and disposition activities; refinancing or early retirement of debt; acquisition integration costs; and asset or goodwill write-downs; as well as other adjustments for restructuring or reorganization activities, all as approved by the Compensation and Management Development Committee ("Adjusted EBITDA"). Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company as a performance measure for both the short-term cash incentive program and the long-term equity incentive program.

Overview of Executive Compensation Components 
The Committee evaluates the alignment between compensation philosophy, plan design and achievement of short and long-term results to determine the components of our Executives' compensation program. Our 2018 executive compensation program consisted of the following compensation elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term cash incentive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives, consisting of service-based restricted stock units ("Service RSUs") and performance-based  restricted stock units ("Performance RSUs");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Health and welfare benefits, including executive physicals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retirement benefits; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination pay.  
[END TABLE]
Each of these elements is discussed below, as well as the methodology used for setting the amount of each type of compensation. 
Base Salary 
Philosophy. The purpose of base salaries is to compensate our Executives for their role and level of responsibility within the Company. Increases in base salary also serve to reward performance and recognize significant increases in the scope of an Executive's position and responsibilities. Our philosophy is to set salaries for our Executives at approximately 
Compensation Matters the 50th percentile of the relevant peer group's salaries for executives with similar positions and responsibilities. Changes to base salaries occur in connection with changes in position and on a periodic basis that is generally twelve months after the most recent adjustment for the Executive. Base salary changes take into account market data for similar positions, the Executive's experience and time in position, any changes in responsibilities and individual performance. Individual performance is determined by considering achievement against each Executive's specific performance goals established at the beginning of each year. Generally, such individual performance goals are established to support the financial and operational goals established by the Board for the Company, and may include earnings before income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges, debt reduction, new product innovation targets, business unit revenue, profitability and cost-saving goals and certain more subjective goals such as talent development, cultural initiatives, compliance and management effectiveness. 
In 2018, the Committee approved base salary increases for the Executives ranging from 4.0% to 15.0%. Such increases were based upon each Executive's performance, scope of position and market data for executives with similar positions and responsibilities and reflect the significantly larger scope of certain positions as a result of the combination with the North America Consumer Packaging business of International Paper Company. Such increases became effective as of January 1, 2018. 
Short-Term Cash Incentive 
The Company provides a short-term cash incentive opportunity under the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"). The purpose of the MIP is to provide a meaningful short-term cash incentive that rewards the achievement of specified annual financial goals. For 2018, the financial measures used to set such financial goals or targets were Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction. The Committee chose these financial metrics because they are well understood, objective targets and have a direct link to the Company's business plan. The Company calculates Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction as the year-over-year change in net debt, as adjusted for merger, acquisition, disposition, share repurchase, dividend and capital market activities, as well as other adjustments for restructuring or reorganization activities and other unusual items, all as specifically approved by the Compensation and Management Development Committee. 
Target Opportunities. We set the MIP target percentage for each Executive at approximately the 50th percentile of relevant peer group companies. Adjustments to MIP target levels are made periodically, taking into consideration the relevant peer group, the CEO's recommendations (for Executives other than himself) and input from the compensation consultant. The annual incentive target (as a percentage of salary) for each of the Executives for 2018 is set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Name       Incentive Target       
   Name       Incentive Target       
 Michael P. Doss          120%       
 Stephen R. Scherger          80%       
 Carla J. Chaney          65%       
 Alan R. Nichols          75%       
 Lauren S. Tashma          65%       
 Joseph P. Yost          75%       
[END TABLE]
Performance Goals. We set performance goals for the MIP so that achievement of such goals at target supports our annual operating plan. The degree to which MIP pays out varies both up and down based on business performance. If the threshold performance goal of 85% of our Adjusted EBITDA goal is not met or the Company fails to meet any of its quarterly financial covenant measures during the year, no payout under the MIP is earned. Our performance goals for 2018 were Adjusted EBITDA of $965.0 million (weighted at 50% in the calculation) and Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction of $420.0 million (weighted at 50% in the calculation). Achieving these performance goals would present an opportunity for a MIP award at target. The payout for performance at 95% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 90% of Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction goals was set at 50% of the MIP target, and no payout would be earned for performance at or below 85% of our Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction performance goals. The payout for performance at 105% or more of our Adjusted EBITDA and 110% of Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction goals (after appropriate accrual for the greater compensation expense) was set at a maximum of 200% of the MIP target. 
Actual Short-Term Cash Incentive Payouts for 2018. Actual short-term cash incentive payouts for 2018 for the Executives are shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. The 
Compensation Matters 
Company's performance with respect to its Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Before Debt Reduction performance goals, were achieved at 96.5% and 112.3% of target, respectively, resulting in a calculated MIP payout at 132.6% of target. However, because the cash flow performance related to a one-time gain on the sale of an asset, management recommended and the Committee and the Board of Directors exercised negative discretion to approve payouts under the MIP at up to 100% of the target level. 
For more information on the 2018 annual incentive opportunities for the Executives, refer to the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table in this Proxy Statement. The column titled "Estimated Possible Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" provides the estimated payouts for the Executives at threshold, target and maximum performance levels for 2018. 
Long-Term Incentives 
The Company's long-term incentive program has two elements: Service RSUs and Performance RSUs. Service RSUs make up one-third of the total long-term incentive value that the Company grants to its Executives and Performance RSUs make up two-thirds of such total value. A greater proportion of Performance RSUs is consistent with the Company's desire to tie a larger percentage of the Executives' compensation to Company performance. Both Service RSU and Performance RSU grants are intended to retain Executives during a multi-year vesting period, align the long-term interests of Executives with our stockholders and promote equity ownership. 
Service RSUs represent the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock for each vested Service RSU granted. The Performance RSUs represent the right to earn from 0% to 200% of the target award based upon the Company's achievement of specific performance goals established for a three-year performance period. Service RSUs and Performance RSUs are payable solely in shares of the Company's common stock. 
Service RSUs and Performance RSUs granted under the long-term incentive program generally vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant (assuming the Executive has continued in his or her employment by the Company through such date). Upon death, disability, retirement (as defined in the grant agreement) or involuntary termination without cause, a proportion of the RSUs vests. In the event of a change of control (as defined in the Graphic Packaging Holding Company 2014 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan")), all Service RSUs and earned Performance RSUs vest in full. The number of Performance RSUs considered earned in the event of a change of control is determined based on assumed target performance for the performance period. 
Payout of 2015 Grants. In January 2018, the Committee approved the payout of the Performance RSUs granted in 2015 at 42.0% of target, based the achievement of the performance goals for the three-year performance period. For the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2017, the performance goals were aggregate Adjusted EBITDA of $2,370.0 million and Return on Invested Capital of 12.60%. 
2018 Grants. In February 2018, the Company granted both Service RSUs and Performance RSUs to each Executive, under the long-term incentive program. For Executives, the total number of RSUs granted was set based on a value delivered as a percentage of salary formula, with the percentage established based on a review of responsibilities, market data and internal equity considerations. The target value of RSUs granted under the long-term incentive program (as a percentage of salary) during 2018 for each of our Executives is set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Michael P. Doss        460%  
 Stephen R. Scherger        215%  
 Carla J. Chaney        155%  
 Alan R. Nichols        185%  
 Lauren S. Tashma        155%  
 Joseph P. Yost        185%  
[END TABLE]
In addition, as an incentive to make the integration of the combination with International Paper Company's North America Consumer Packaging business successful, each Executive received a 15% higher grant of Performance RSUs. Mr. Scherger, Ms. Tashma and Mr. Yost received one-time increases in their aggregate RSU grants of 5%,10% and 5%, respectively, to promote retention. 
For the Performance RSUs granted in 2018, the performance goals are achievement of a preset aggregate Adjusted EBITDA amount and a preset return on invested capital percentage. The Adjusted EBITDA goal is weighted in the 
Compensation Matters calculation of the Company's annual achievement at 60% and the return on invested capital percentage goal is weighted in the calculating the Company's annual achievement at 40%. The Committee weighted the Adjusted EBITDA goal slightly more than in prior years to reflect the priority placed on meeting earnings commitments. Total payout is also subject to a relative total stockholder return ("TSR") modifier, which can modify payouts earned up or down by up to 20% (subject to the 200% of target cap). This payout modifier was added to measure the Company's stock performance against other similar companies and to more closely align management and stockholders' interests. 
Health and Welfare Benefit Plans 
The Company provides the Executives and other employees with health and welfare benefits comparable to those they would receive at other companies and that are necessary for the Company to remain competitive in the marketplace for high-performing talent. Executives participate in employee benefit plans available to all salaried employees, including medical, dental, vision, accidental death and dismemberment, business travel accident, prescription drug, life and disability insurance. Senior executives of the Company, including the Executives, are eligible for an executive physical benefit in which the Company pays for an annual physical exam through a specified provider under the Company's medical plan. Continuation of health and welfare benefits for a limited time may occur as part of severance upon certain terminations of employment. 
Perquisites 
The Company generally does not provide significant perquisites to its Executives, other than Company-requested international assignment and relocation benefits and tax gross-ups with respect thereto and executive physicals. 
Retirement Benefits 
The Company maintains qualified defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for our employees in which certain of the Executives participate. These plans provide retirement benefits to retain eligible employees and Executives and encourage and reward tenure with the Company. In addition to the qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the Company maintains non-qualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans in which certain of the Executives also participate. The qualified benefit plans have a maximum compensation limit and a maximum annual benefit limit, which restrict the benefit to participants whose compensation exceeds these limits. To provide retirement benefits commensurate with pay levels, the non-qualified plans provide benefits to key salaried employees, including the Executives, using substantially the same formula for calculating benefits as used in the qualified plans, but on compensation in excess of the compensation limitation and maximum annual benefit. 
Qualified and Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plans. Executives and other employees hired before January 1, 2008, participate in either the Riverwood International Employees Retirement Plan or the Graphic Packaging Retirement Plan and the Graphic Packaging Excess Benefit Plan (together, the "Pension Plans"). As of June 30, 2011, the Company froze the Pension Plans and no longer makes pension contributions for future service on behalf of any employees who were not at least 50 years old with five years of completed service to the Company as of such date. As a result, the Company no longer makes pension contributions on behalf of any of the Executives, although Messrs. Doss and Yost have frozen benefits thereunder. 
The Executives who participate in the Pension Plans also participate in either the Riverwood International Supplemental Retirement Plan or the Graphic Packaging Supplemental Retirement Plan (together, the "Supplemental Plans"). Mr. Doss participated in the Graphic Packaging Retirement Plan and the Graphic Packaging Supplemental Plan until January 1, 2005, the date he transferred into the Riverwood International Employees Retirement Plan and the Riverwood International Supplemental Retirement Plan. The Supplemental Plans provide a benefit based upon compensation that exceeds the limits set by the IRS for the Pension Plans and makes total retirement benefits under the Company's defined benefit plans for the Executives commensurate with those available to other employees as a percent of pay. When the Company froze the Pension Plans, it also froze the Supplemental Plans for those employees who were not at least 50 years old with five years of completed service to the Company as of such date, so the Company no longer makes contributions to the Supplemental Plans on behalf of any of the Executives, although Messrs. Doss and Yost have frozen benefits thereunder. 
Qualified and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plans. Executives and all other non-union employees who meet certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Graphic Packaging International, LLC Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), which is a qualified defined contribution plan under the rules of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). Employees who choose to contribute to the 401(k) Plan receive matching contributions from the Company equal to 100% of 
Compensation Matters the first four percent (4%) of employee contributions and 50% of the next three percent (3%) of employee contributions. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2008 are eligible for an annual supplemental contribution by the Company to their 401(k) Plan account equal to 3% of eligible earnings. 
In 2011, the Company implemented a deferred compensation and 401(k) restoration plan that permits Executives and other eligible senior employees to contribute to and receive contributions from the Company on a basis that would be commensurate with other employees as a percent of pay. This plan, the Graphic Packaging International, LLC Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "NQDCP"), permits participants to defer and contribute from 1% to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their payment under the MIP to the plan. The plan offers investment options that generally mirror those available under the Company's 401(k) Plan. Annually, the Company makes a 401(k) restoration matching contribution on behalf of those participants who do not participate in or receive future service accruals under the Company's Pension Plans equal to a percentage of their annual deferral amount divided by compensation over the annual IRS limit, up to a maximum of 5.5%. The Company also makes a supplemental contribution equal to 3% of eligible pay over the annual IRS limit for those Executives and senior executives of the Company who do not participate in or receive future service accruals to one of the Company's Pension Plans or Supplemental Plans and who have met the one year of service eligibility requirement. The NQDCP also provides an employer contribution equal to 3% of total pay for eligible senior executives (including all of the Executives) who do not receive contributions to one of the Company's Pension Plans. 
Employment Agreements and Potential Payments on Termination 
Executive officers serving prior to January 2014 (Messrs. Doss, Scherger, Nichols and Yost and Ms. Chaney) have employment agreements with generally uniform provisions, including non-competition and non-solicitation covenants as well as claims releases and severance provisions. The employment agreements specify position, base salary and aggregate annual bonus opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) for each Executive at the time the Agreement was entered into, as well as severance arrangements under different circumstances. Executives may receive severance benefits if they are terminated involuntarily or terminate voluntarily for Good Reason (as defined below) within 30 days of the Good Reason event. The Executive must deliver written notice of intention to terminate for Good Reason, specifying the applicable provision, and provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to cure. The Good Reason provision in the agreements was designed to equalize the treatment of voluntary terminations for Good Reason with involuntary terminations without cause. Doing so enables the contracts to fulfill their purpose of promoting retention during times of uncertainty and transition. "Good Reason" as defined in the agreements includes material reduction in position, responsibilities or duties, failure by the Company to obtain the assumption of the agreement by a successor company, reduction in base salary (unless the reduction does not exceed 10% and is applied uniformly to all similarly situated executives), breach of agreement or mandatory relocation (other than in connection with promotion) of more than 50 miles. 
For Mr. Doss, the severance benefit is an amount equal to one year's base salary, his target bonus for the year in which termination occurs and his actual bonus based on the plan targets, prorated for the number of days Mr. Doss is employed during the year in which termination occurs. For Messrs. Scherger, Nichols and Yost and Ms. Chaney, the severance benefit is one times base salary. Executives also receive health and welfare benefits for one year after termination and a pro-rata bonus payout. Mr. Doss also vests in any unvested equity awards on the date of his termination as if he were retirement eligible (daily pro-rata vesting) without regard to his actual age or years of service on the date of termination. In addition, if an Executive is separated from service without cause or for Good Reason within one year of a change in control, the Executive receives (i) an additional 1/2 year of base salary (one year for Mr. Doss) and (ii) instead of the pro-rata bonus, a bonus equal to the Executive's target level bonus for the year in which the separation occurs (assuming that all performance targets had been achieved) multiplied by 1.5 (multiplied by 2 for Mr. Doss). All benefit payments under the employment agreements are conditioned upon the Executive executing and returning a claims release to the Company. 
Executives who do not have employment agreements are eligible to participate in the Graphic Packaging International, LLC Executive Severance Plan. Similar to the provisions in the employment agreements, the Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits equal to one year's base salary and a pro-rata bonus if the Executive is terminated involuntarily without cause or terminates his or her employment for Good Reason. If such a termination occurs within one year after a change in control, Executives receive an additional one-half year's base salary and an amount equal to his or her bonus at target level as if he or she had been employed for the entire year multiplied by 1.5. Payments under the Executive Severance Plan are conditioned upon the participant executing a release that includes a general release of claims against the Company and an agreement to certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation of employee and customer provisions. 
Compensation Matters 
In addition to the change in control provisions in the employment agreements and the Executive Severance Plan, the award agreements for Service RSUs and Performance RSUs provide for accelerated vesting and payout in the event of a change in control. A "change-in-control" means any of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power or  outstanding shares of common stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, except if such acquisition is by a person who, prior to such acquisition, is the beneficial owner of thirty percent (30%) or more of such  securities, or is such acquisition is by any employee benefit plan or related trust;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individuals of the incumbent Board (other than those whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or  threatened election contest relating to the election or removal of directors of the Company) do not constitute at least a majority of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party unless (i) all or  substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the Beneficial Owners of the Company's outstanding securities prior to such transaction beneficially own more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the  outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the corporation resulting from the transaction, and (ii) no person (excluding successors to current stockholders or any employee benefit plan or related  trust) beneficially owns thirty percent (30%) or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities, except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the transaction, and (iii) at least a majority of the  members of the board of directors of the resulting entity were members of the incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or of the action of the Board providing such reorganization, merger or consolidation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
The forgoing events were chosen to trigger the vesting and payout of RSUs because they constitute a fundamental change in the ownership or control of the Company, which materially alters the prospects and future of the Company and, therefore, the employment conditions and opportunities for the members of management who receive RSUs. 
Policies Applicable to Executive Officers 
Clawback Policy 
The Company has a clawback policy that calls for the recoupment of any equity-based award or short-term incentive compensation under the MIP given to a current or former employee in the event of a restatement of the Company's reported financial results. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material non-compliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws and the employee (i) is determined by the Committee to have knowingly or grossly negligently engaged in misconduct, or knowingly or grossly failed to prevent misconduct, or (ii) if the employee is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other regulation, the employee must reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of any award earned or accrued during the twelve month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever just occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Company has adopted stock ownership guidelines that apply to the non-management members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers (including the Executives). The guidelines require such persons to maintain ownership of the Company's common stock having a value equal or greater than: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 3x the annual cash retainer paid to the non-management members of the Board of  Directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 5x the base salary paid to the President and CEO  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 3x the base salary for the Executive Vice Presidents  
[END TABLE]
Shares owned by a Director or executive officer and unvested Service RSUs count toward satisfaction of the stock ownership guidelines. Unvested Performance RSUs do not count toward satisfaction of the stock ownership guidelines. 
Compensation Matters 
Directors and executive officers are expected to achieve their applicable ownership levels within five years of becoming subject to the guidelines. All of the Company's non-management Directors and Executives are in compliance with the guidelines. 
Timing of Compensation 
Base salary adjustments, annual incentive payments and annual RSU grants are generally approved at the first or second Committee meeting and first Board meeting of the year. Our policy is that for awards of equity compensation, the date of grant is no earlier than the date upon which the grant is approved by the Committee or the Board, as appropriate. 
Consideration of Most Recent Advisory Stockholder Vote on Executive Compensation 
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 23, 2018, 93.3% of the shares represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting were voted to approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as discussed and disclosed in the 2018 Proxy Statement. In considering the results of this advisory vote on executive compensation, the Committee concluded that the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers and the Company's overall pay practices enjoy strong stockholder support. Going forward, future advisory votes on executive compensation, including the vote on the executive compensation described in this Proxy Statement will serve as an additional tool to guide the Board and the Committee in evaluating the alignment of the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 24, 2017, our stockholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year. Consistent with this preference, the Board has implemented an advisory vote on executive compensation once every year. The next required vote on the frequency of stockholder votes will occur at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Additional Information regarding the Summary Compensation Table 
Salary. The amounts shown as salaries in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 represent amounts actually paid during 2018 and may not be the same as current base salary levels. The salaries shown include amounts contributed to the Company's NQDCP by the Executive. 
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. The Company's MIP is designed to provide short-term incentive awards based upon the accomplishment by the Company of performance goals established at the beginning of each year. Awards are paid in cash during the first quarter of the following year. The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table represent amounts earned in 2018 and paid during the first quarter of 2019. 
Stock Awards. In 2018, the Compensation and Management Development Committee and the Board approved grants of RSUs under the 2014 Plan to our Named Executive Officers. These grants were made up of Service RSUs (1/3 of total grant) and Performance RSUs (2/3 of total grant). The number of shares paid out pursuant to the Performance RSUs is determined by the accomplishment of certain performance metrics established by the Board of Directors. Specifically, the performance metrics are Adjusted EBITDA for the three-year period ending December 31, 2020 (50% weight) and return on invested capital for the three-year period ending December 31, 2020 (50% weight). All of the RSUs vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are payable in shares of the Company's common stock. 
Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. Amounts shown in the Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table represent only the aggregate increase (if any) in the present value of accumulated benefits under our Pension Plans and Supplemental Plans. None of the Named Executive Officers realized above-market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation. 
CEO Pay Ratio Information 
In accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company is required to determine and disclose the total annual compensation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer (who is Michael P. Doss, the Company's President and CEO) and the total annual compensation of the employee with the median of the total annual compensation of all employees of the Company (excluding Mr. Doss) and then express these amounts as a ratio. 
To determine the employee with the median total annual compensation, the Company chose all cash compensation paid during 2018 to each of its domestic and international employees as of December 31, 2018 as its consistently applied compensation measure. The Company did not annualize salaries for those employees who started working for the Company during 2018 or those employees who were on leave for a portion of 2018. For those international employees paid in a different currency, the Company converted the total of all cash compensation paid to such employees to U.S. dollars, based on the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2018. Using this methodology, the Company determined the median employee's total annual compensation was $53,678. The total annual compensation of our President and CEO was $7,264,270. The ratio of the total annual compensation of our President and CEO to the median employee's total annual compensation was 135:1.

Additional Information regarding the Pension Benefits at 2018 Fiscal Year End Table 
The Riverwood International Employees Retirement Plan and Riverwood International Supplemental Retirement Plan. All U.S. salaried employees hired prior to January 1, 2008, who satisfied the service eligibility criteria and who were not participants in the Graphic Packaging International Corporation Retirement Plan (the "GPIC Retirement Plan") are participants in the Riverwood International Employees Retirement Plan (the "Employees Retirement Plan"). Pension benefits under this plan are limited in accordance with the provisions of the Code governing tax-qualified pension plans. The Company also maintains the Riverwood International Supplemental Retirement Plan for participants in the Employees Retirement Plan that provides for payment to participants of retirement benefits equal to the excess of the benefits that would have been earned by each participant had the limitations of the Code not applied to the Employees Retirement Plan and the amount actually earned by such participant under such plan. Service benefits were frozen under the plan for all participants other than those who were 50 years old and had 5 years of service (the "Grandfathered Participants") as of June 30, 2011. Benefits under the Riverwood International Supplemental Retirement Plan are not pre-funded; such benefits are paid by the Company. 
Annual remuneration, defined as "Salary" in the Employees Retirement Plan, includes annual salary paid, amounts paid as bonuses under the annual incentive compensation plan and certain other bonus awards, but excludes payments in lieu of perquisites and payments under any equity incentive plan or long-term incentive plan. 
As of December 31, 2017, Mr. Doss and Mr. Yost had the completed years of credited service set forth above in the Pension Benefit Table. Estimated benefits are not subject to a reduction to reflect the payment of Social Security benefits or other offset amounts. The years of service calculated for Mr. Doss include years of service credited under the GPIC Retirement Plan described below. Mr. Doss participated in the GPIC Retirement Plan until January 1, 2005 when he was transferred into the Employees Retirement Plan. 
GPIC Retirement Plan. The Company's U.S. salaried employees who (i) were previously employed by Graphic Packaging International Corporation ("GPIC"), (ii) satisfied the service eligibility criteria and (iii) did not participate in the Employees Retirement Plan participate in the GPIC Retirement Plan. Pension benefits under the GPIC Retirement Plan are limited in accordance with the provisions of the Code governing tax qualified pension plans. GPIC also maintained the Graphic Packaging Supplemental Retirement Plan that provided the benefits that were not payable from the qualified retirement plan because of limitations under the Code. None of the Company's Named Executive Officers participated in the GPIC Retirement Plan during 2017.

Deferred Compensation. In 2011, the Company implemented the NQDCP, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan to which Executives and other eligible senior employees may defer a portion of their annual base salary and/or payment under the MIP, and to which the Company may also make additional contributions. Contributions to the NQDCP were first made during 2012. The NQDCP permits participants to defer and contribute from 1% to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their payment under the MIP to the plan. The NQDCP offers deemed investment options that generally mirror those available under the Company's 401(k) Plan. The Company may, in its discretion, make contributions to the NQDCP, such as 401(k) restoration matching contributions and other supplemental contributions for Executives and eligible senior employees who do not participate in or receive future service accruals to one of the Company's Pension Plans or Supplemental Plans. NQDCP distributions will be made or commence on the earlier of the six-month anniversary of a participant's separation from service with the Company, a change in control of the Company or, if elected by the participant, on a specified date. Payment will be made in a lump sum or in annual installments (up to 10) as elected by the participant.

The table below reflects the amount of compensation that would become payable to each of the Named Executive Officers under existing plans and arrangements if the Named Executive Officer's employment was terminated (i) because of death; (ii) because of disability; (iii) by the Company without cause or by the Named Executive Officer for Good Reason (as described in such Named Executive Officer's employment agreement or, with respect to Ms. Tashma, the Executive 
Compensation Matters 
Severance Plan); or (iv) by the Company without cause or by the Named Executive Officer for Good Reason within one year following a change in control of the Company, in each such case as of December 31, 2018, given the Named Executive Officer's compensation and service levels as of such date and, if applicable, based on the Company's closing stock price on that date. These benefits are in addition to benefits available prior to the occurrence of any termination of employment and benefits available to all salaried employees, such as distributions of employee contributions and Company matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) Plans and any accrued untaken vacation pay. These benefits are also in addition to the benefits described above in the Pension Benefits table. 
In the event that a Named Executive Officer is terminated for cause, no cash severance is payable and the Named Executive Officer forfeits all unvested equity awards. In addition, no continued welfare benefits or outplacement services are provided to the Named Executive Officer. 
On September 15, 2018, Mr. Nichols retired from the Company. In consideration for Mr. Nichols agreeing to delay his retirement until September 15, 2018, the Company agreed to pay him an amount of severance equal to his base salary over a period of twelve months and a prorated award under the MIP, assuming payout at target. Mr. Nichols will also vest in the number of his Performance-Based RSUs and Service-Based RSUs equal to the product of the number of RSUs originally granted, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days between the grant date and the date of retirement and the denominator of which is 1,095. Mr. Nichols vested in a total of 111,706 RSUs, all of which will be paid out in accordance with their terms three years from the date of grant. On the date of his retirement, such RSUs had a value based on the closing price of the Company's common stock of $1,613,035. The Company will also pay to continue Mr. Nichols' life, medical, dental and prescription drug benefits for period of one year from the date of retirement (at a cost of approximately $19,008), and may reimburse expenses incurred for outplacement services up to a maximum of $25,000. 
The actual amounts that would be paid upon a Named Executive Officer's termination of employment can be determined only at the time of an executive's actual separation from the Company. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events shown below, actual amounts paid or distributed may be higher or lower than reported below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the maximum payouts under any incentive plans and the executive's age.

Proposal 3—Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation ("say-on-pay") 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that the Company include in this Proxy Statement a non-binding stockholder vote on the executive compensation described in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as a "Say-on Pay" vote). The Company encourages stockholders to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the additional executive compensation information contained in this Proxy Statement. The Board of Directors believes that the Company's compensation program appropriately balances the need to incentivize our executives to achieve the Company's objectives with responsible pay practices, thereby aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. 
The Board of Directors strongly endorses the Company's executive compensation program and recommends that the stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement under "Compensation Matters," including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure contained in this Proxy Statement is hereby approved. 
This vote is advisory and will not be binding upon the Board of Directors or the Compensation and Benefits Committee and neither the Board nor the Compensation and Benefits Committee will be required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. The Compensation and Benefits Committee will, however, carefully consider the outcome of this vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the Company's executive compensation. 
Additional Information 
PROXY SOLICITATION AND HOUSEHOLDING 
The Company will bear the entire cost of proxy solicitation, including the preparation, Internet posting, assembly, printing, mailing and distribution of proxy materials. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited personally by telephone by certain employees. The Company will reimburse brokers or other persons holding stock in their names or in the names of nominees for their expense in sending proxy materials to beneficial holders and obtaining their proxies. 
Some banks, brokers or other nominee record holders of the Company's common stock may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one copy of the Company's Proxy Statement and Annual Report may be sent to multiple stockholders in the same household. The Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of either document to any stockholder upon request submitted in writing to the Company at the following address: Graphic Packaging Holding Company, 1500 Riveredge Parkway, Suite 100, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, Attention: Corporate Secretary or by calling (770) 240-7200. Any stockholder who wants to receive separate copies of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement in the future, or who is currently receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for his or her household, should contact his or her bank, broker or other nominee record holder.
