Governance Highlights
Our Board believes that good corporate governance enhances shareholder value. Our governance practices include:
Executive Compensation Highlights
Hill-Rom's compensation program is designed to align the compensation of each named executive officer ("NEOs" or "Named Executive Officers") with Hill-Rom's performance and the interests of our shareholders, and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate key personnel in a clear, transparent manner. In order to do this, we:
Last year's Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation received support of approximately 94% of our shareholders (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). Based on the results of the shareholder vote, no significant changes to our compensation program took place in fiscal year 2018.
In summary, we compensate our NEOs as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive    Compensation  Stock Options (25% of annual grant value)   Restricted Stock Units (25% of annual grant value)   Performance Stock Units (50% of annual grant value) 35-39

We also adhere to several additional principles regarding executive compensation for our NEOs, which we believe highlight the strength of both our governance practices and our overall executive compensation program:

The Board recommends that you vote:
You may vote by any of the following methods: 
No.
If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the voting polls are closed at the meeting by the following methods:
If you are a street name shareholder and you voted by proxy, you may later revoke your proxy by informing the holder of record in accordance with that entity's procedures.
If you are a shareholder of record and your proxy card is signed and returned without voting instructions, it will be voted according to the recommendation of the Board.
If you are a street name shareholder and fail to provide voting instructions, your broker, bank or other holder of record is permitted to vote your shares on the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, they may not vote on the election of directors or the other proposals listed herein absent instructions from you. Without your voting instructions, a "broker non-vote" will occur with respect to those other proposals.
Votes are counted in accordance with both our Amended and Restated Code of By-laws (our "By-laws") and Indiana law. A broker non-vote or abstention will be counted towards a quorum, but will not be counted in the election of directors or the votes on any of the other proposals (except for the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, as described in Question 9).
A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote, represented at the meeting in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum. Broker non-votes and abstentions will be counted as represented at the meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
The matters described in the Notice of Annual Meeting of the Shareholders are the only matters we know of that will be voted on at the meeting. If other matters are properly presented at the meeting, the persons named on the proxy card or voting instruction form will vote your shares according to their best judgment.
A representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., an independent tabulator appointed by the Board, will count the votes and act as the Inspector of Election.  The Inspector of Election will have the authority to receive, inspect, electronically tally and determine the validity of the proxies received.
Admission to the meeting is limited to shareholders of Hill-Rom as of the record date, persons holding validly executed proxies from shareholders who held Hill-Rom common stock as of the record date, and invited guests of Hill-Rom.

Additionally, proof of ownership of Hill-Rom stock must be shown at the door. Failure to pre-register or to provide adequate proof that you were a shareholder as of the record date may prevent you from being admitted to the meeting. Please read the following rules carefully because they specify the documents that you must bring with you to the meeting in order to be admitted.
If you were a record holder of Hill-Rom common stock as of the record date, then you must bring a valid government-issued personal identification (such as a driver's license or passport).
If a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee was the record holder of your shares of Hill-Rom common stock as of the record date, then you must bring:
If you are a proxy holder for a shareholder of Hill-Rom, then you must bring:
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by shareholders entitled to vote, which means that nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected even if such amount is less than a majority of the votes cast. However, our Corporate Governance Standards provide that, prior to the meeting, director nominees shall submit a letter of resignation that is effective in the event such director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election.  The Board is required to accept the resignation unless the Board determines that accepting such resignation would not be in the best interests of Hill-Rom and its shareholders.
The non-binding proposal to approve the compensation of our NEOs and the proposal to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm will be approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action.  
We do.

You may also be solicited by means of press releases issued by Hill-Rom, postings on our website, and advertisements in periodicals. None of our officers or employees will receive any extra compensation for soliciting you. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist us in soliciting your proxy for an estimated fee of $10,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We will also reimburse banks, nominees, fiduciaries, brokers and other custodians for their costs of sending the Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Hill-Rom common stock.

Proposal No. 2 – Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation
We hold an annual non-binding vote on Executive Compensation each year. Accordingly, we are presenting to our shareholders the following resolution for their annual vote (on a non-binding basis):
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs and the overall compensation policies and procedures employed by Hill-Rom, disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K, and described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular disclosure regarding NEO compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosure) in this proxy statement."
As described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 24, our philosophy in setting executive compensation is to provide a total compensation package that allows us to continue to attract, retain and motivate talented executives who drive our Company's success, while aligning compensation with the interests of our shareholders and ensuring accountability and transparency. Consistent with the philosophy, a significant majority of the total compensation opportunity for each of our NEOs is based on measurable corporate, business area and individual performance, both financial and non-financial, and on the performance of our shares on a long-term basis.
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Compensation and Management Development Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of this resolution.
Proposal No. 3 – Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Subject to shareholder ratification, the Audit Committee of our Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Representatives from PwC will be present at the meeting with an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring that all services from the outside independent registered public accounting firm must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its delegate and has adopted guidelines that non-audit related services should not exceed the total of audit and audit related fees. During fiscal year 2018, PwC's fees for non-audit related services fell within these guidelines.
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by PwC for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Hill-Rom's independent registered public accounting firm.

Board Leadership
The Board is currently led by our non-executive, independent Chair, Mr. Dempsey. The Board has determined that the leadership of the Board is best conducted by an independent Chair which allows (i) the Chair to provide overall leadership to the Board in its oversight function and (ii) the president and CEO, Mr. Groetelaars, to provide leadership with respect to the day-to-day management and operation of our business. The separation of these offices enables Mr. Dempsey to focus on managing Board matters while letting Mr. Groetelaars focus on managing our business. We believe that the separation of these offices enhances the objectivity of the Board in its management oversight role and that this leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
During fiscal year 2018, and in anticipation of the departure of Mr. John J. Greisch (Hill-Rom's previous president and CEO), effective March 6, 2018, the Board appointed Mr. Dempsey to serve as the Executive Chair of the Board. In that role, Mr. Dempsey provided executive leadership and guidance during the period of management transition and continued to provide leadership to the Board. At the time Mr. Dempsey was named the Executive Chair, the Board no longer deemed him independent and thereby named Mr. Malone to serve as the Board's independent Lead Director effective as of March 6, 2018 to maintain the Board's independent oversight function. At the time Mr. Dempsey was appointed to serve as the Executive Chair of the Board, he ended his service as a member of the Audit Committee.
Mr. Dempsey continued to serve as Executive Chair of the Board from his appointment on March 6, 2018 through July 16, 2018, at which time the Board ended his service as Executive Chair of the Board. Mr. Dempsey earned $789,231 in base salary and $650,000 in Restricted Stock Units in his role as Executive Chair, as previously disclosed and in accordance with the terms set forth in the Form 8-K the Company filed with the SEC on March 7, 2018. At such time, and after the Board had determined Mr. Dempsey's independence based on discussions with Mr. Dempsey and a review of his responses to questions about employment history, affiliation and family and other relationships with the Company, Mr. Dempsey resumed his prior role as independent Chair of the Board. In addition, effective July 16, 2018, the Board ended Mr. Malone's service as independent Lead Director and Mr. Malone resumed his prior role as Board Member and Chair of the Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee.
Assuming Mr. Dempsey is re-elected to the Board at the meeting, the Board plans to re-elect Mr. Dempsey as the Chair of the Board at the recommendation of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. 
Executive sessions (meetings of independent directors without management present) are held regularly at the beginning and end of Board meetings, and, depending on directors' desire, from time to time during Board and committee meetings.  The Chair generally presides at executive sessions of non-management directors.
Board's Role in Strategic Planning and Oversight of Risk Management
The Board is responsible for directing and overseeing the management of Hill-Rom's business in the best interests of the shareholders and consistent with good corporate citizenship. The Board sets strategic direction and priorities for the Company, approves the selection of the senior management team and oversees and monitors risks and performance. At Board meetings during the year, members of senior management review their organizations and present their long-range strategic plans to the Board, and at the start of each fiscal year, the Board reviews and approves the Company's operating plan and budget for the next fiscal year.
A fundamental part of setting Hill-Rom's business strategy is the assessment of the risks Hill-Rom faces and how they are managed. The Board oversees risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance risks. In addition, each of the Board, the Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee, and Audit Committee, as necessary, meet regularly throughout the year with our financial and treasury management teams and with our Chief Compliance Officer, Vice President, Internal Audit, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Information Officer to assess the strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance risks throughout our businesses and to review our insurance and other risk management programs and policies. These regular meetings enable the Board to exercise its ultimate oversight responsibility for Hill-Rom's risk management processes.
Communications with Directors
Shareholders of Hill-Rom and other interested persons may communicate with the Chair of the Board, the chairs of the committees of the Board, or the non-management directors of Hill-Rom as a group by sending an email to investors@hill-rom.com.  The email should specify the intended recipient.
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings
Hill-Rom does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at its annual meetings of shareholders, but Hill-Rom's directors generally do attend the annual meetings. The Chair of the Board presides at the annual meeting of shareholders, and the Board holds one of its regular meetings in conjunction with the annual meeting of shareholders. All continuing members of the Board at the time of our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders attended that meeting in person.
Corporate Governance Standards and Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Standards that provide the framework for the effective functioning of the Board. In addition, the Board has adopted a Global Code of Conduct that applies to everyone who conducts business for and with Hill-Rom including all directors, officers and employees of Hill-Rom, agents, vendors, suppliers and consultants worldwide, and which constitutes a "code of ethics" within the meaning of Item 406 of the SEC's Regulation S-K. The Board reviewed the Global Code of Conduct during fiscal year 2018 and did not recommend any changes. Both the Corporate Governance Standards and the Global Code of Conduct are available via the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at http://ir.hill-rom.com.
Determinations with Respect to Independence of Directors
The Board determines the independence for each member of the Board based on an annual evaluation performed and recommendations made by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, consistent with the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").  
Based on these standards and all relevant facts and circumstances, the Board has determined that each current member of the Board and each nominee for the Board is independent, with the exception of John P. Groetelaars, who is not independent.
Transactions with Related Persons
The Company has written procedures regarding the review and preapproval of related party transactions involving executive officers or directors. Under these procedures, our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and preapproving all related person transactions. When reviewing and/or approving proposed related party transactions, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including: the benefits to us; the impact on a director's independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the transaction; and the terms available for similar transactions with unrelated third parties.
Meetings, Committees and Board Skills Assessment of the Board of Directors
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board held seven meetings. During this period, no incumbent member of the Board attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the full Board and the meetings of the committees on which he or she served, and our incumbent directors attended an average of 97% of the meetings of the Board and committees on which they served.
Per our Corporate Governance Standards, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee assessed the Board's effectiveness as a whole as well as the effectiveness of the individual directors and the Board's various Committees, including a review of the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications (including independence under applicable standards) of members of the Board and its various committees, which reflect expertise in one or more of the following areas: chief executive officer experience, strong healthcare experience, financial acumen, international experience, regulatory experience, sales and marketing experience, product development/ design experience, payor and reimbursement experience, science/technology expertise with clinical applications, acute care provider experience, mergers and acquisitions and integration experience, and cybersecurity experience.
In order to make these assessments, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee solicited the opinions of each director regarding the foregoing matters and then presented its findings and recommendations to the Board. In addition to the above, the particular skills and talents of any director nominee should positively contribute to the diversity of the various skills and talents of the Board as a whole. 
The following table shows the current composition of the committees of the Board, all of which operate pursuant to written charters:

** Mr. Golden informed the Board of his decision to retire from the Board effective as of the date of the meeting.
The Audit Committee has general oversight responsibilities with respect to Hill-Rom's financial reporting and controls, and legal, regulatory and ethical compliance. It regularly reviews Hill-Rom's financial reporting process, its system of internal control over financial reporting, legal and regulatory compliance and ethics, and internal and external audit processes. Each member of the Audit Committee is independent under Rule 10A-3 of the SEC and NYSE listing standards and meets the financial literacy guidelines established by the Board in the Audit Committee Charter. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Golden, Ellis and Giertz is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in Item 407(d) of the SEC's Regulation S-K.
The Compensation and Management Development Committee assists the Board in ensuring that the officers and key management of Hill-Rom are effectively compensated in a way that is internally equitable and externally competitive and is responsible for approving our CEO compensation. The Compensation and Management Development Committee is also responsible for reviewing and assessing the talent development and succession management actions concerning the officers and key employees of Hill-Rom.
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in ensuring that Hill-Rom is operated in accordance with prudent and practical corporate governance standards, ensuring that the Board achieves its objective of having a majority of its members be independent in accordance with NYSE listing standards, and identifying and evaluating candidates for the Board. In identifying and evaluating candidates for the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers each candidate's experience, integrity, background and skills as well as other qualities that the candidate may possess and factors that the candidate may be able to bring to the Board. Although we do not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates, the Board believes that it is essential that its members represent diverse viewpoints, with a broad array of experiences, professions, skills, geographic representation and backgrounds that, when considered as a group, provide a sufficient mix of perspectives to allow the Board to best fulfill its responsibilities to the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also assists the Audit Committee with Hill-Rom's non-financial compliance oversight.
The Mergers and Acquisitions Committee assists the Board in reviewing and assessing potential mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other similar strategic transactions and meets on an ad hoc basis.
Nomination of Directors for Election by Shareholders
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers director candidates recommended by shareholders, and any such recommendations should be communicated to the Chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee in the manner described above in "Communications with Directors" and should be accompanied by the same types of information as are required under our By-laws for shareholder nominees.
Our By-Laws provide that nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of Hill-Rom may be made at any meeting of shareholders by or at the direction of the Board or by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of members of the Board at the meeting. For nominations to be made by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Corporate Secretary of Hill-Rom and any nominee must satisfy the qualifications established by the Board.  To be timely, a shareholder's nomination must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Corporate Secretary not later than (i) in the case of the annual meeting, 100 days prior to the anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting which was specified in the initial formal notice of such meeting (but if the date of the forthcoming annual meeting is more than 30 days after such anniversary date, such written notice will also be timely if received by the Corporate Secretary by the later of 100 days prior to the forthcoming meeting date and the close of business 10 days following the date on which Hill-Rom first makes public disclosure of the meeting date) and (ii) in the case of a special meeting, the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which Hill-Rom first makes public disclosure of the meeting date. The notice given by a shareholder must set forth: (i) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record, setting forth the shares so held, and intends to appear in person or by proxy as a holder of record at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and each nominee proposed by the shareholder and any other person or persons (identifying such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholders; (iv) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC; (v) the consent in writing of each nominee to serve as a director of Hill-Rom if so elected; and (vi) a description of the qualifications of such nominee to serve as a director of Hill-Rom.
Compensation and Management Development Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the following directors served on the Compensation and Management Development Committee: Nancy M. Schlichting, William H. Kucheman and Stacy Enxing Seng. The Compensation and Management Development Committee had no interlocks or insider participation.

Hill-Rom maintains an independent Audit Committee that operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board. The charter is available on Hill-Rom's website at www.hill-rom.com under "Our Company–Company Overview–Board of Directors–Corporate Governance–Documents & Charters." Each member of the Audit Committee is independent as defined in the NYSE listing standards and SEC rules, and the Board has determined that each of Messrs. Golden, Ellis and Giertz is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in Item 407(d) of the SEC's Regulation S-K.
Management is responsible for Hill-Rom's internal controls, financial reporting process (including quarterly earnings press releases), risk assessment policies, compliance with laws and regulations and ethical business standards. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an integrated audit of Hill-Rom's consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and the issuance of a report thereon. The Audit Committee has the responsibility to monitor and oversee these processes.
As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets separately at least twice each quarter (once to review the quarterly external financial reporting, and at least once in connection with regularly scheduled Board meetings). At these meetings, the Audit Committee meets with management, the Vice President of Internal Audit (solely with respect to regularly scheduled Board meetings) and Hill-Rom's outside independent registered public accounting firm, as necessary (in each case, with and without management present, at the Audit Committee's discretion) to discuss the adequacy and effectiveness of Hill-Rom's internal controls and the quality of the financial reporting process. The Audit Committee also pre-approves all audit and non-audit services to be performed by the outside independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee evaluates the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm, including senior audit engagement team members, on an annual basis and determines whether to reengage the current firm or consider other audit firms. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided, global capabilities and technical expertise, knowledge of the Company's global operations and industry and the effectiveness of their communications in providing value-added advice, insights and candid feedback on risks, controls and compliance matters. The Audit Committee also considers how effectively the outside independent registered public accounting firm maintains its independence and employs its independent judgment, objectivity and professional skepticism. Based on our evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to approve the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as Hill-Rom's outside independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. PwC has been the independent registered public accounting firm used by Hill-Rom since 1985.
In accordance with SEC rules, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements that limit the number of years an individual partner may provide service to any company. For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of Hill-Rom's lead audit partner pursuant to this policy involves meetings between members of the Audit Committee and the candidates, as well as discussion and evaluation by the full Audit Committee and with Hill-Rom management.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and PwC. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Hill-Rom's audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. PwC discussed with the Audit Committee matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 16. Management and PwC also made presentations to the Audit Committee throughout the year on specific topics of interest, current developments and best practices for audit committees.
PwC also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence.  PwC informed the Audit Committee that it was independent with respect to Hill-Rom within the meaning of the securities acts administered by the SEC and the requirements of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee discussed this finding, and also considered whether non-audit consulting services provided by PwC could impair the auditors' independence and concluded that such services have not done so.
Based upon the foregoing, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Hill-Rom's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.

Compensation and Management Development Committee Report
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement with management and, based upon this review and discussion, recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The Compensation and Management Development Committee
Contents of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Named Executive Officers
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes our compensation program and how it applies to our NEOs, comprising:
Goals of Our Compensation Program 
Hill-Rom's compensation program is designed to:
In aggregate, the compensation of Hill-Rom's executive officers is assessed against the compensation paid to comparable officers of companies with which Hill-Rom competes for executives, with an initial market check and focus on the 50th percentile of compensation opportunity provided to such executives. However, actual individual pay decisions are subjective and based on multiple factors. Hill-Rom is guided by the belief that the compensation of executive officers should be competitive with the market, be aligned with the performance of the Company on both a short-term and long-term basis, take into consideration individual performance of the executive, be internally equitable among peers, and assist in retaining key executives critical to the Company's long-term success. Hill-Rom's use of performance-based compensation means that, in any given year, total compensation can vary when pre-established business and/or personal targets and objectives are exceeded or are not achieved. Accordingly, a significant portion of our executives' compensation is at risk.
Role of the Compensation and Management Development Committee 
The Board's Compensation and Management Development Committee (for purposes of this CD&A, the "Committee") is charged with ensuring that Hill-Rom's compensation program meets the objectives outlined above. In that role, the Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for assuring that the officers and key management personnel of the Company are effectively compensated in terms of salaries, supplemental compensation and other benefits which are internally equitable, externally competitive, and advance the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders. The Committee also reviews and assesses the talent development and succession management actions concerning the officers and key employees of the Company, administers Hill-Rom's compensation plans and keeps the Board informed regarding executive compensation matters.  
The Committee, in consultation with Hill-Rom's independent compensation consultant and the full Board, determines the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the compensation of the senior executive team, including Hill-Rom's other NEOs. From time to time, Hill-Rom's management also provides recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the elements and structure of Hill-Rom's compensation program. In addition to the aforementioned recommendations, the Committee considers peer group data, survey data and other factors when determining the elements and amounts of compensation.
Compensation Consultant
The Committee engages nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to evaluate independently and objectively the effectiveness of and assist with implementation of Hill-Rom's compensation and benefit programs and to provide the Committee with additional expertise in the evaluation of Hill-Rom's compensation practices. During fiscal year 2018, the Committee engaged Exequity LLP ("Exequity") as its executive compensation consultant. Exequity has been asked by the Committee to provide guidance on compensation proposals, including changes to compensation levels, the design of incentive plans, as well as relevant information about market practices and trends.
Exequity is an independent compensation consultant that provided no other services to Hill-Rom other than those services provided to the Committee. After considering the six independence factors discussed in Section 303A.05(c)(iv)(A)-(F) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the Committee determined that Exequity had no conflict of interest pursuant to Item 407(e)(3)(iv) of the SEC's Regulation S-K.
Peer Group and Survey Data
As one of several factors in considering approval of elements of Hill-Rom's compensation program, the Committee compares Hill-Rom's compensation program and performance against an approved peer group of companies. The compensation peer group (the "Compensation Peer Group"), which is annually reviewed and updated by the Committee, consists of companies that are similar in revenue (typically 0.5x to 2.5x Hill-Rom's revenue) and in similar industries as Hill-Rom and with whom Hill-Rom may compete for executive talent. For fiscal year 2018, the Committee reviewed the Compensation Peer Group for appropriateness and made no changes. The companies that made up the Compensation Peer Group are as follows:

Links Between Executive Compensation and Company Performance
Overall, the Committee believes the Company's compensation policies and programs are effective, market-appropriate, and in line with shareholder expectations.
The key components of our compensation program that link compensation and performance are as follows:
2018 Advisory Vote
Last year's Non-Binding Vote on Executive Compensation received support of approximately 94% of our shareholders (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). Based on the results of the shareholder vote, no significant changes to our compensation program took place in fiscal year 2018.
CEO Compensation
While the Committee works to align the pay of all of our executives with the interests of our shareholders, the Committee believes that such alignment is especially important in the case of our Chief Executive Officer, John Groetelaars. Accordingly, the Committee has selected a mix of compensation opportunities for Mr. Groetelaars which is weighted towards annual bonus[es] and long-term equity based compensation.
The components of Mr. Groetelaars's pay are as follows:
Performance-Based Pay
The Committee believes it is important to ensure that a meaningful portion of Mr. Groetelaars's compensation is performance-based. In fiscal year 2018, the majority of Mr. Groetelaars's target total compensation was in the form of an annual cash incentive and long-term, equity-based incentives. In fiscal year 2018, Mr. Groetelaars's target annualized cash incentive comprised 17% of his target total compensation. Along with 67% long-term, equity-based compensation at target, 84% of Mr. Groetelaars's fiscal year 2018 annualized total compensation target was at risk. The chart below details Mr. Groetelaars's target performance-based total compensation for fiscal year 2018.
Total Percentage of Fiscal Year 2018 Target Annualized Compensation that is Performance-Based: 84%

Base Salary
Hill-Rom provides senior management a base salary that is competitive at a level consistent with their positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge. Base salary is intended to aid in the attraction and retention of talent in a competitive market and is targeted at the market median, although actual salaries may be higher or lower as a result of various factors, including those given above as well as individual performance, internal pay equity within Hill-Rom, length of service with Hill-Rom and the degree of difficulty in replacing the individual. The base salaries of senior management are reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis, as well as at the time of promotion or significant changes in responsibility. The independent compensation consultant provides the Committee with benchmark data as part of the review process.  For fiscal year 2018, the Committee granted the following increases which reflect its assessment of each of the NEO's performance during the preceding year, as well as the consideration of market benchmarking for similarly placed executives:

Fiscal Year 2019 Changes to Base Salary. Based on a review of the competitive market and individual performance, the Committee approved a salary increase for Mr. Groetelaars of 2.00% increasing his salary to $1,020,0000. The Committee approved salary increases of approximately 3.08% for Mr. Strobel, 1.46% for Mr. Alonso and 10.00% for Mr. Johnson, increasing their base salaries to $535,000, $488,000, and $484,000, respectively. Mr. Shader did not receive a salary increase.
In line with the goals of our compensation program, as well as his performance during fiscal year 2018, Mr. Johnson received a base salary increase of 10% in each of fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 to ensure his salary is aligned to the competitive market.
Annual Cash Incentives
Overview.  All NEOs participate in the annual cash incentive plan (the "Cash Incentive Plan"), which is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. The Cash Incentive Plan provides for a maximum award equal to 2.0% of our EBITDA (as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Cash Incentive Plan) for our CEO and 1.0% for each other NEO.  However, in determining actual awards made under the Cash Incentive Plan, the Committee has the discretion to, and has in the past, paid actual awards which are lower than the maximum awards. The Committee exercises this negative discretion by reference to the Company-wide Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "STIC Plan"), which is discussed herein. The objective of the STIC Plan is to align the annual cash compensation of an executive to the annual performance of the Company on key financial metrics.
Each NEO receives a target award that can be adjusted upwards or downwards based on achieving Company-wide financial performance targets and individual performance targets.
STIC Plan Payment Calculation.  The STIC Plan payment to any individual is calculated by multiplying (a) base salary by (b) STIC Plan target opportunity by (c) STIC Plan Funding Percentage (as defined hereinafter) by (d) the Individual Performance Modifier (the "Individual Performance Modifier").
STIC Plan Funding Percentage.  Under the terms of the STIC Plan, the Committee establishes a STIC Plan pool each year that is funded based upon the achievement of pre-established performance objectives. The STIC Plan pool is funded at between 0% and 150% of aggregate target opportunities (the "STIC Plan Funding Percentage").
Individual Performance Modifier. Under the terms of the STIC Plan, the Committee may apply a modifier to an executive's award based on the achievement of individual performance objectives. To evaluate individual performance, individual goals are set each year for each NEO. These include shared financial and strategic objectives as well as objectives that are directly related to each NEO's specific business function. Except with respect to his own performance, this assessment is based on our CEO's recommendation to the Committee on how well the NEO performed his or her job, based on both qualitative and quantitative results. There is no specific weight given to any one individual goal or objective. This evaluation of the impact of the individual contributions on actual compensation is not a formula-based process resulting in a quantifiable amount of impact, but rather involves the exercise of discretion and judgment. This enables the Committee to differentiate among NEOs and emphasize the link between personal performance and compensation.  The Individual Performance Modifier is assigned between 0% and 150% of the NEO's funded STIC award.
For fiscal year 2018, the targets and achievements (in millions, except per share data) were as follows:

(1) Revenue as reported to investors was $2,848 million versus a STIC revenue of $2,851. The difference between the reported numbers and the numbers used to calculate STIC relates to divestiture activities and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
(2) Adjusted EPS as reported to investors was $4.75 versus a STIC Adjusted EPS of $4.25. Adjusted EPS as reported to investors excludes the impact of strategic developments, acquisition and integration costs, special charges, the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform legislation, significant litigation expenses and other unusual events. The difference between the Adjusted EPS and STIC Adjusted EPS relates to the exclusion for STIC Adjusted EPS of the ongoing benefit realized from U.S. tax reform legislation and the tax benefit from excess stock compensation deductions above amounts included in our plan.
(3) Free Cash Flow as reported to investors was $306 million versus STIC Free Cash Flow of $274 million. The differences between the reported numbers and the numbers used to calculate STIC relates to the cash flow impact of special items, U.S. tax reform legislation and excess stock compensation deductions above amounts included in our Plan.
(4) Following the completion of fiscal year 2018, the Committee reviewed the adjusted financial performance of Hill-Rom against the predetermined financial targets and determined that the Committee would exercise its negative discretion and set the aggregate corporate STIC Plan Funding Percentage at 110% and reallocate the difference to other business units in an effort to align business incentives.
The objectives are set with the intention that the relative level of difficulty in achieving the targets is consistent from year to year.  In addition, in order to encourage management to take actions in the best interests of Hill-Rom, the Committee has the discretion to exclude nonrecurring special charges and amounts from the calculation of these targets.  Further, the Committee considers the broader performance of the business to determine whether negative discretion should be applied to the financial performance of the STIC Plan Funding Percentage outlined above. Following the completion of fiscal year 2018, the Committee reviewed the adjusted financial performance of Hill-Rom against the predetermined financial targets and determined that based on the Company's performance in fiscal year 2018, the Committee would exercise its negative discretion and set the aggregate STIC Plan Funding Percentage at 110%.
STIC Target Opportunity and Fiscal Year 2018 Payouts. The following chart shows the fiscal year 2018 STIC Plan Target Opportunity and fiscal year 2018 STIC Plan Payout for each NEO.

Fiscal Year 2019 Changes to Plan Design and Target Opportunity. In order to drive growth within the business, the Committee has rebranded the annual incentive program as Business Incentive for Growth ("BIG"), effective for fiscal year 2019. The structure of BIG will be similar to the STIC Plan. Employees eligible to participate in BIG will be placed into differentiated funding pools according to the business unit(s) and geographic region(s) in which such employees work (collectively, the "business unit pools"). Employees who work as part of our corporate function rather than a specific business unit will participate in a separate BIG funding pool (the "corporate pool"). The design of the corporate pool (in terms of the pooling percentage of 0% to 150%) will not change relative to our STIC Plan effective for fiscal year 2018. However, BIG differentiates the business unit pools by providing a pool funding percentage of 0% to 200% of aggregate target opportunities (versus 0% to 150% for the corporate pool). NEOs who are Presidents of business units will participate equally in the corporate pool and their respective business unit pool; with each pool weighted 50%. Business unit pool target opportunity measures will be (i) revenue, weighted 60% and (ii) operating income, weighted 40%. The Committee confirmed that the fiscal year 2018 target opportunity measures used in the STIC Plan remain appropriate for the BIG corporate pool for fiscal year 2019.
Long-Term Equity Based Incentive (LTI) Awards
Overview:  Hill-Rom's Stock Incentive Plan provides for the opportunity to grant stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), PSUs and other equity-based incentive awards to officers, other key employees and non-employee directors to help align those individuals' interests with those of shareholders, to help motivate executives to make sound strategic long-term decisions, and to better enable Hill-Rom to attract and retain capable directors and executives.
Hill-Rom's LTI program provides a portfolio approach to long-term incentives by providing:
In addition, the Committee considers the Stock Incentive Plan share usage rate, compensation expense, number of plan participants and potential aggregate target awards for participants when determining target award levels and the mix of long-term incentive awards.

Stock Options. In fiscal year 2018, a stock option grant was made to each of the NEOs equal to 25% of the target long-term equity award opportunity. Stock options vest in four equal annual installments.
RSUs. In fiscal year 2018, an RSU grant was made to each of the NEOs equal to 25% of the target long-term equity award opportunity. RSUs vest on a three-year cliff basis. For fiscal year 2019, we changed our vesting period for RSU Awards from a three-year cliff basis to an annual basis over three years.
PSUs.  In fiscal year 2018, a PSU grant was made to each of the NEOs equal to 50% of the target long-term equity award opportunity. These awards provide the opportunity to earn a predefined number of shares based on achievement of performance objectives during a three-year performance period. The number of units earned can vary from no payout for below threshold performance to 225% of target for maximum performance.
Calculation of shares. The dollar value of an LTI award at grant is converted to RSUs and PSUs based on the average closing price of Hill-Rom stock over a period of the 20 business days prior to the grant date. A binomial stock option valuation model is used to calculate the number of stock options awarded.
Prior performance unit plan payouts. For the PSU awards granted in fiscal year 2016, vesting was based on a one-year Adjusted Free Cash Flow measure modified by relative TSR over a three-year period, in each case, subject to a minimum percentage payout of 0% of target for below threshold performance, and a maximum percentage payout of 150% of target for maximum performance (or a total of 225% of target for maximum performance of both Adjusted Free Cash Flow and relative TSR).

* The fiscal year 2016 – 2018 Free Cash Flow measure's performance was determined on September 30, 2016 and relative TSR was determined on September 30, 2018. Free Cash Flow as reported to investors was $197.6 million versus PSU Free Cash Flow of $200 million. The differences between the reported numbers and the numbers used to calculate the PSU Free Cash Flow relates to the impact of acquisition and integration costs, special charges, legislative changes and other unusual events.
Under the fiscal year 2016 – fiscal year 2018 PSU program, Mr. Greisch earned 52,853 shares of stock, Mr. Strobel earned 12,254 shares of stock, Mr. Shader earned 11,054 shares of stock, Mr. Alonso earned 9,811 shares of stock, and Mr. Johnson earned 2,001 shares of stock. At the time the fiscal year 2016 PSU award was granted, Mr. Groetelaars was not employed by the Company.
Beginning with the fiscal year 2017 PSU award, the one-year Free Cash Flow measure was replaced by a three-year Free Cash Flow measure. This change means that payouts are subject to reduction to zero for the full three-year performance period.
The TSR Peer Group used for the PSUs granted in fiscal year 2018 includes the companies in the Compensation Peer Group as well as the companies that comprised the former Morgan Stanley Healthcare Products Index at the time it was delisted in 2015 with the exception of companies impacted by merger and acquisition activities: Heartware International (which was acquired by Medtronic), Sirona Dental Systems (which merged with Dentsply), C.R. Bard, Inc. (which was acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company), Thoratic (which was acquired by St. Jude Medical) and St. Jude Medical (which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories) six companies with lower overall business comparability: Align Technology, Cantel Medical Corp., Charles River Laboratories International, IDEXX Laboratories, Illumina and Mettler-Toledo International. To supplement this group with additional peers to establish a larger sample size, eight companies were added in fiscal year 2017 and four companies were added in fiscal year 2018. These companies all have similar revenue, market value and industry as Hill-Rom.

Fiscal Year 2019 Changes to LTI Target Opportunity: The Committee confirmed that the fiscal year 2018 LTI Target Opportunities remain appropriate for all NEOs in fiscal year 2019 except for Mr. Groetelaars whose target increased from 400% to 417% of his fiscal year 2019 base salary and Mr. Johnson whose target increased from 175% to 200% of his fiscal year 2019 base salary, based on the results of compensation benchmarking performed by the Committee's independent compensation consultant and in line with the goals of our compensation program.
Share Ownership Guidelines.  In order to align the interests of executives to the long-term performance of the Company, executive officers are required to own a certain amount of Hill-Rom stock within five years of joining the Company. The ownership requirements are as follows:
Shares owned outright and unvested RSUs count toward the required ownership level. This requirement, like the Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy discussed below, helps ensure long-term focus and appropriate levels of risk-taking by executive officers. Messrs. Strobel, Shader, Alonso and Johnson have achieved their required ownership levels, and Mr. Groetelaars (who is on track to meet the required ownership level) has not been with the Company for more than five years, and therefore is not required to meet these guidelines until his five-year anniversary with the Company.
Hill-Rom's Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy. Under our Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy, the Committee can recoup from executive officers all performance-based compensation and any trading profits on trades in Hill-Rom securities received during the prior 24 months in the event there is a material restatement of financial results due to misconduct of the executive officer from whom recoupment is sought. The Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy gives the Committee discretion to determine whether and to what extent to seek recoupment based on specific facts and circumstances.
Timing of Equity Grants. We generally make all equity grants to our executives on an annual basis (except in the case of a new hire or promotion), and these grants have historically been made at our November Board meeting.
Anti-Hedging/Anti-Pledging Policy. Hill-Rom has adopted an insider trading policy which incorporates anti-hedging and anti-pledging provisions. Consequently, no officer or director may enter into a hedge or pledge of Hill-Rom stock.
Re-pricing and Buybacks. With respect to each of our NEOs, Hill-Rom does not re-price options, nor does it buy back shares (other than shares acquired by the Company at fair market value to cover tax withholding and option exercise).
Retirement and Change in Control Agreements
Overview.  Hill-Rom believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to have the unbiased dedication of its executives, without the distractions of personal uncertainties such as retirement or a change in control.  Hill-Rom has designed its senior management retirement and other post-employment benefit programs to reduce such distractions and align to competitive practices of other comparable companies.  
Retirement Guidelines for Executives.  With respect to executives hired before August 1, 2016, those who are at least 55 years of age and with 5 years' length of service are eligible to receive certain benefits under Hill-Rom's Stock Incentive Plan.  With respect to executives hired on or after August 1, 2016, those who are at least 55 years of age and with 10 years' length of service are eligible to receive certain benefits under Hill-Rom's Stock Incentive Plan. These guidelines are incorporated into each individual equity award agreement and have been approved by the Committee.  The following is allowed upon retirement:
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.  The Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") provides additional retirement benefits to certain employees selected by the Committee whose retirement benefits under our pension plan or 401(k) plan are reduced, curtailed or otherwise limited as a result of certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Change in Control Agreements.  Hill-Rom has a change in control agreement in place with each NEO.  These change in control agreements are of the form commonly referred to as "double-trigger" agreements, in that they are triggered only in the event that an executive is terminated in connection with a change in control, not merely if a change in control occurs. Moreover, they do not contain any 280G gross-up provisions. They are intended to encourage continued employment by Hill-Rom of its key management personnel and to allow such personnel to be in a position to provide assessment and advice to the Board regarding any proposed change in control without concern that such personnel might be unduly distracted by the uncertainties and risks created by the proposed transaction. For information on the potential payments to executives on a change in control, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 48 and 49.
Other Personal Benefits
In addition to the elements of compensation discussed above, we also provide senior level management with various other benefits in order to remain competitive with the market, in attracting and retaining qualified executives. Hill-Rom believes that these benefits are in-line with the market, are reasonable in nature, are not excessive and are in the best interest of Hill-Rom and its shareholders. None of our NEOs receive any excise tax or perquisite tax gross-ups, other than for reasonable relocation costs and housing allowance, as applicable.
Employment Agreements
We have entered into an employment agreement with each of our NEOs. We believe that it is appropriate for our senior executive officers to have employment agreements because they provide certain contractual protections to us that we might not otherwise have, including provisions relating to non-competition with us, non-solicitation of our employees and confidentiality of our proprietary information. Additionally, we believe that employment agreements are a useful tool in recruiting and retention of senior level employees. The current employment agreements set forth the basic duties of the senior executive officers and provide that each senior executive officer is entitled to receive, in addition to base salary, incentive compensation payable at our discretion and such additional compensation, benefits and perquisites as we may deem appropriate. The employment agreements are terminable by either us or the executive officer "without cause" on sixty (60) days' written notice, or if terminated by us, pay in lieu of notice, and are terminable at any time by us for cause, as defined in each employment agreement. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 48 and 49 for further information regarding payments due upon termination. The employment agreements also contain non-competition and non-solicitation agreements of the senior executive officers, which continue generally for a period of eighteen to twenty-four months after the termination of the senior executive officer's employment.
Fiscal Year 2018 Changes to Employment Agreements. The Committee approved certain changes to employment agreements effective in fiscal year 2019. The employment agreements are terminable by either us or the executive officer "without cause" on 180 days written notice. Further, the non-competition and non-solicitation agreements of the senior executive officers will continue for a period of 18 months for the CEO and 12 months for other officers.
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
Assisted by its independent compensation consultant, the Committee reviewed our material compensation policies and practices applicable to our employees and executive officers. Following the independent consultant's review and recommendation, the Committee concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Key features of the compensation program supporting this conclusion include:

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Benefits Payable Upon Termination Under Employment Agreements
The following tables set forth estimates of the amounts payable to each of our NEOs upon specified termination events, based upon a hypothetical termination date of September 30, 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
John J. Greisch (7) Retired  President and Chief Executive Officer                                                  
John J. Greisch (7) Retired  President and Chief Executive Officer                                                  
[END TABLE]
(1) Benefits provided under our disability plans are based on various circumstances including the NEO meeting certain eligibility requirements. Our disability plans are fully insured; therefore, claim payments are reviewed and processed by our third-party insurance carrier.  The following assumptions were used to determine the salary and other cash payment amount for permanent disability: normal retirement age is based on the Social Security Normal Retirement Age Table and long-term disability benefits are based on the lesser of 60% of the NEO's monthly earnings or $15,000 per month; and a 4.2% discount rate.
(2) For the CEO, this represents the cash payment of an amount equal to the unvested portion of company contributions in the SERP that would immediately become vested upon death, disability, termination without cause or termination with good reason and three times the amounts accrued for the twelve months immediately prior to the termination under the SERP. Messrs. Strobel, Alonso, and Johnson are vested in the SERP so no additional benefit would be received upon termination.
(3) The amounts indicated represent the intrinsic value of all unvested non-qualified stock options that would have become vested and exercisable upon retirement, permanent disability, death or in connection with agreements providing for the vesting of awards upon Termination without Cause and the market value of all unvested RSUs and PSUs that would have vested upon retirement, permanent disability, death or in connection with agreements providing for the vesting of awards upon Termination without Cause.  The amounts were calculated based on the closing price of our common stock of $94.40 on September 30, 2018, except for in the case of Mr. Greisch, whose awards are valued on May 14, 2018, the date of his retirement.
(4) Amounts represent the dollar value of the incremental cost to Hill-Rom by providing continuing health and life insurance coverage based on the individual's selected coverage in effect immediately before the hypothetical termination.
(5) On November 26, 2018, Mr. Strobel notified the Company of his intention to retire from the Company following a transition period. Effective December 3, 2018, Mr. Strobel took on a new role as senior advisor to the Company's CEO and he is expected to remain in such new role through November 17, 2019, his anticipated retirement date.
(6) Mr. Shader left the Company on December 1, 2018.
(7) Mr. Greisch retired from the Company on May 14, 2018.
Termination Due to Death or Permanent Disability
In the event an NEO dies or suffers a permanent disability during the term of employment, the NEO will be immediately vested in the SERP.
Termination Without Cause or Resignation with Good Reason 
Upon a termination by the Company without cause or a resignation for good reason, each NEO other than the CEO is eligible to receive severance pay of then-current base salary for twelve months, and the CEO is eligible to receive severance pay of then-current base salary for twenty-four months. Each NEO will be immediately vested in the SERP. Health and similar welfare benefits will continue on substantially the same terms and conditions as at the time of the termination until the earlier of (i) the end of twelve months or (ii) such time as the NEO is eligible to be covered by comparable benefits of a subsequent employer.
In addition to the severance pay noted above, in the event any NEO's (other than the CEO) employment is terminated by the Company without cause on or before November 16, 2019, such NEO will be entitled to receive cash payments for all outstanding unvested equity awards that are forfeited as a result of termination of employment that otherwise would have vested on or before November 16, 2019, calculated as follows:
During fiscal year 2018, the Committee approved certain changes to the benefits received by each NEO upon termination by the company without cause or resignation with good reason effective in fiscal year 2019 including the following: 1) severance pay will be calculated on the basis of base salary and target short-term incentive and 2) a pro-rata short-term incentive for the year of termination will be paid. 
Termination For Cause or Resignation Without Good Reason 
Upon a termination by the Company for cause or a resignation without good reason, an NEO will not receive a severance payment.
Retirement
Current NEOs who are at least 55 years old and who have at least five years of service (or ten years of service for those NEOs with effective hire dates on or after August 1, 2016) are eligible for certain retirement benefits, including the full vesting of outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options which have been held for at least one year and partial vesting of outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options which have been granted within one year of retirement. Vested stock options can be exercised until the earlier of either the original expiration date or the three-year anniversary of the retirement date. PSUs vest based on the Company's achievement of the performance goals during the performance period. PSUs vest after the completion of the performance period and are based on the Company's achievement of the performance goals during that period.
Benefits Payable Under Change in Control Agreements
Based upon a hypothetical change in control date of September 30, 2018, the change in control benefits with a termination of employment would be as follows:
(1) For the CEO, this represents the cash payment of an amount equal to the unvested portion of company contributions in the SERP that would immediately become vested upon death, disability, termination without cause or termination with good reason and three times the amounts accrued for the twelve months immediately prior to the termination under the SERP. Messrs. Strobel Alonso, and Johnson are vested in the SERP so no additional benefit would be received upon termination.
(2) The amounts indicated represent the intrinsic value of all unvested non-qualified stock options that would have become vested and exercisable upon termination in connection with a change in control and the market value of all unvested RSUs and PSUs that would have vested upon termination in connection with a change in control.  The amounts were calculated based on the closing price of our common stock of $94.40 on September 30, 2018, adjusted, as applicable, for Section 280G limitations.
(3) Amounts represent the dollar value of the incremental cost to Hill-Rom by providing continuing health and life insurance coverage based on the individual's selected coverage in effect immediately before the hypothetical termination.
(4) On November 26, 2018, Mr. Strobel notified the Company of his intention to retire from the Company following a transition period. Effective December 3, 2018, Mr. Strobel took on a new role as senior advisor to the Company's CEO and he is expected to remain in such new role through November 17, 2019, his anticipated retirement date.
(5) Mr. Shader left the Company on December 1, 2018.
(6) Mr. Greisch retired from the Company on May 14, 2018.
Change in Control 
In the event that a NEO other than the CEO is terminated in connection with a change in control, the NEO will receive a cash payment of two times the then-current annual base salary plus a sum equal to the amount of all accrued and unpaid vacation and business expenses; the CEO will receive a cash payment of three times the then-current annual base salary. Health and similar welfare benefits for NEOs other than the CEO will continue on substantially the same terms and conditions for twenty-four months (thirty-six months for the CEO). Life insurance benefits for NEOs other than the CEO will continue for a period of two years following the termination (three years for the CEO). 
The NEO will receive a cash payment equal to the amount of short term incentive compensation which would be payable if the Company had achieved performance targets (at 100%) in effect for the year in which the termination occurred, and the NEO will receive accelerated vesting of certain equity awards. If not already vested, the NEO would become immediately vested in the SERP. In addition to the benefits listed above, the CEO will also receive a cash payment for amounts accrued as of the date of the termination under the SERP and an additional amount equal to three times the amounts accrued for the twelve months immediately prior to the termination under the SERP.
During fiscal year 2018, the Committee approved certain changes to the benefits received by each NEO upon termination and change in control effective in fiscal year 2019 including the following: 1) severance pay will be calculated on the basis of base salary and target short-term incentive and 2) payment of a pro-rata actual short-term incentive for the year of termination will be paid instead of target incentive.

 Pay Ratio Disclosure   
 Pay Ratio Disclosure   
 Pay Ratio Disclosure   
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following disclosure about the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Groetelaars, our CEO, to the annual total compensation of our median employee.
Because Hill-Rom had two different CEOs during fiscal year 2018, SEC rules allow us the option of calculating the compensation provided to each CEO during fiscal year 2018 for the time each served as CEO and combine those amounts, or the CEO serving in that position on the date we selected to identify the median employee (July 15, 2018) and annualize that CEO's compensation. We decided to annualize the compensation Mr. Groetelaars received for his role as President and CEO of Hill-Rom beginning on May 14, 2018. 
For 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO) was $64,559. The 2018 annualized total compensation of our CEO was $7,582,263. Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 117:1. We believe this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
For purposes of reporting annual total compensation and the ratio of annual total compensation of the CEO to the median employee, both the CEO and median employee's annual total compensation were calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under the Summary Compensation Table.
To identify the median employee, we examined the 2018 total cash compensation, including base salaries, overtime payments, allowances, incentives and commissions paid, to all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us as of July 15, 2018, as reflected in our payroll records. In accordance with Item 402(u) and instructions thereto, we included all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees. We selected total cash compensation for all employees as a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees and because we believe that this measure reasonably reflects the total annual compensation of our employees. For purposes of calculating the total cash compensation of our non-U.S. employees, we converted local currencies to U.S. dollars based on our fiscal year 2018 operating plan exchange rates.
Once we identified our median employee based on that analysis, we then determined that employee's annual total compensation in the same manner that we determine the total compensation of our NEOs for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table, as discussed above.

Director Compensation 
[END TABLE]
In setting non-employee director compensation, the Board considers the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to Hill-Rom as well as the skill-level required for members of the Board. Our director pay package is designed to attract and retain highly-qualified, independent professionals to monitor the effectiveness of policy and decision-making both at the Board and management level, with a view to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. Our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee generally reviews our non-employee director compensation program on an annual basis, with the assistance of the compensation consulting firm used by the Compensation and Management Development Committee. Directors who are also employees of Hill-Rom receive no additional remuneration for services as a director.
Non-Employee Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018
For fiscal year 2018, our non-employee directors (other than the Chair of the Board) received a quarterly cash retainer of $18,750; the Chair of the Board's quarterly retainer was $38,750. The Lead Director received a one-time retainer in the amount of $25,000. Committee members of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Management and Development Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received a quarterly retainer in the amount of $3,125, $1,875 and $1,250, respectively. Chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Management and Development Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received a quarterly retainer in the amount of $6,250, $5,000 and $3,750, respectively. Committee members also received a fee in the amount of $1,500 for each special committee meeting attended, in person or by telephone. In addition, each non-employee director is, on the first trading day following the close of each annual meeting of the Company's shareholders, awarded vested deferred RSUs valued at $180,000 ($220,000 in the case of the Chair of the Board).

Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our directors, our executive officers and any person holding more than ten percent of our common stock are required to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock.

Appendix A – Reconciliation of non-GAAP  and GAAP Financial Measures 
[END TABLE]
The following table reconciles financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") to non-GAAP financial results. We routinely provide gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share results on an adjusted basis because the Company's management believes these measures contribute to an understanding of our financial performance, provide additional analytical tools to understand our results from core operations and reveal underlying trends. These measures exclude strategic developments, acquisition and integration costs, special charges or other unusual events. The Company also excludes expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets associated with prior business acquisitions. These adjustments are made to allow investors to evaluate and understand operating trends excluding the non-cash impact of acquired intangible amortization on operating income and earnings per share.
Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performance of the business. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
In addition, we present certain results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained consistent period-over-period. We monitor sales performance on a constant currency basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars. We calculate constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. We believe that evaluating growth in net revenue on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment to both management and investors.
