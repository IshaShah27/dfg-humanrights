GENERAL INFORMATION AND 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") and the accompanying proxy card are first being sent on or about March 27, 2019, to the stockholders of Regional Management Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Regional," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our"), in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on April 25, 2019, at Regional's headquarters located at 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, SC 29651, at 8:00 a.m. local time and any postponement or adjournment thereof. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, containing financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, is being mailed together with this Proxy Statement to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Why did I receive a proxy card and Proxy Statement? 
As a stockholder of record on March 1, 2019, you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The accompanying proxy card is for use at the Annual Meeting if a stockholder either will be unable to attend in person or will attend but wishes to vote by proxy in advance of the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you are encouraged to vote by proxy in advance. Instructions as to how you may cast your vote by proxy are found on the proxy card. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person. 
The proxy card is solicited by mail by and on behalf of the Board, and the cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by us. In addition to solicitations by mail, proxies may be solicited in person, by telephone, or via the Internet by our directors and officers who will not receive additional compensation for such services. We will request banks, brokerage houses, and other institutions, nominees, and fiduciaries to forward the soliciting material to beneficial owners and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. We will, upon request, reimburse these parties for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy materials to our beneficial owners. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
The purpose of the Annual Meeting is: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  to elect the eight nominees named in the Proxy Statement to serve as members of the Board until the next annual  meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal  year ending December 31, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  to hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iv)  to transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof.   
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote? 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 (the "Record Date"), will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 11,828,806 shares of our common stock, $0.10 par value per share, were outstanding. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share for each director nominee and to one vote per share on any other proposal presented at the Annual Meeting. 
Brokers that are members of certain securities exchanges and that hold shares of our common stock in "street name" on behalf of beneficial owners have authority to vote on certain items when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules and regulations governing such brokers, the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a "discretionary" item. This means that brokers may vote in their discretion on this proposal on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions. In contrast, certain items are considered "non-discretionary," and a "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner votes on one proposal but does not vote on another proposal because, with respect to such other proposal, the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. The proposals to elect directors and to approve executive compensation are considered "non-
 discretionary," and therefore, brokers cannot vote your shares on these proposals when they do not receive voting instructions from you. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The representation in person or by proxy of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Votes withheld from any nominee, abstentions, and "broker non-votes" are counted as present or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote? 
Stockholders may vote in person or by proxy. Instructions as to how you may cast your vote by proxy are set forth below and are found on the accompanying proxy card. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
              Vote by Internet (www.proxyvote.com): Use the Internet to transmit your voting instructions and for electronic delivery of information up until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on April 24, 2019. Have your  proxy card in hand when you access the website, and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form.

[END TABLE]
Will other matters be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
Aside from the three proposals described above, the Board knows of no other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If any other matter should be presented at the Annual Meeting upon which a vote properly may be taken, shares represented by all proxies received by the Board will be voted with respect thereto in accordance with the best judgment of the persons named as proxy holders and attorneys-in-fact in the proxies. 
May I revoke my proxy instructions? 
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. Proxies may be revoked by (i) filing with our Corporate Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting, a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy; (ii) duly completing a later-dated proxy card relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate Secretary before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting; or (iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy). Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent so as to be delivered to Regional Management Corp., 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651, Attention: Corporate Secretary, before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
With respect to the proposal to elect directors (Proposal No. 1), the eight nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting shall be elected as directors. Regarding the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2), an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter is required for approval. Likewise, the compensation of executive officers (Proposal No. 3) will be approved, on an advisory basis, if a majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on such matter is cast in favor of the proposal. "Broker non-votes" are not considered voted for the particular matter, and for proposals subject to majority voting (Proposal No. 2 and Proposal No. 3), "broker non-votes" have the effect of reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve a majority for such matter by reducing the total number of shares from which the majority is calculated. 
Because your vote on Proposal No. 3 is advisory, it will not be binding on us, our Board, or our Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for our executive officers. 
The persons named as proxy holders and attorneys-in-fact in the proxy card, Peter R. Knitzer and Brian J. Fisher, were selected by the Board and are officers of the Company. All properly executed proxy cards returned in time to be counted at the Annual Meeting will be voted by such persons at the Annual Meeting. Where a choice has been specified on the proxy card with respect to the foregoing matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted in accordance with the specifications. If no such specifications are indicated, such shares will be voted "FOR" the election of all director nominees, "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and "FOR" the advisory approval of executive compensation. 
How can I correspond directly with Regional Management Corp.? 
The address of our principal executive office is 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651, and our telephone number is (864) 448-7000. In addition, any person interested in communicating directly with the independent Chair of our Board or with any other Board member may address such communication to our Corporate Secretary, 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651, who will forward such communication to the appropriate party. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
The Board is responsible for directing and overseeing the management of our business and affairs in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board has implemented written Corporate Governance Guidelines designed to assist the Board in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address a number of matters applicable to directors, including Board composition, structure, and policies; director qualification standards; Board meetings; committees of the Board; roles and expectations of the Board and its directors; director compensation; management succession planning; and other matters. These Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. A stockholder may request a copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651. 
Director Qualifications 
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Nominating Committee") is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of potential director candidates and recommending to the Board those candidates to be nominated for election to the Board. The Nominating Committee considers minimum individual qualifications, including relevant career experience, strength of character, mature judgment, familiarity with our business and industry, independence of thought, and an ability to work collegially with the other members of the Board, and all other factors it considers appropriate, which may include age, diversity of background, existing commitments to other businesses, potential conflicts of interest with other pursuits, legal considerations (such as antitrust issues), corporate governance background, financial and accounting background, executive compensation background, and the size, composition, and combined expertise of the existing Board. The Board and the Nominating Committee monitor the mix of specific experience, qualifications, and skills of the Company's directors in order to ensure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively in light of our business and structure. Stockholders may also nominate directors for election at our annual stockholders' meeting by following the provisions set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), and in such a case, the Nominating Committee will consider the qualifications of directors proposed by stockholders. 
When determining whether director nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes, and professional and functional skills, taken as a whole, to enable our Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Nominating Committee has focused primarily on the valuable contributions of incumbent directors to our success in recent years and on the skills, experience, and individual attributes that each director nominee brings to the Board, including those discussed in the biographical descriptions and matrix set forth below. 
Board Diversity 
The Board recognizes and embraces the value of a diverse board of directors in improving the quality of its performance and our success. Diversity promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, mitigates against groupthink, and ensures that the Board has the opportunity to benefit from all available talent. The Board also recognizes the need for its directors to understand and to be able to respond effectively to the financial needs of its diverse customer base. The promotion of a diverse Board makes prudent business sense and makes for better corporate governance. 
In February 2018, the Board approved its Board Diversity Policy (the "Diversity Policy"), which is available on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. The Diversity Policy establishes the Board's approach to achieving and maintaining diversity on the Board. The Board and the Nominating Committee are committed to actively seeking out highly qualified, diverse candidates to include in the pool from which Board nominees are chosen. The Board seeks to comprise itself of talented and dedicated directors with a diverse mix of expertise in areas needed to foster our business success, as well as a diversity of personal characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, age, and geography. The Board and the Nominating Committee implement the Diversity Policy by maintaining a director candidate list comprised of individuals qualified to fill openings on the Board, which includes candidates with useful expertise who possess diverse personal backgrounds. When director openings occur, the list will be used to assist in selecting new directors. Ultimately, the selection of new directors will be based on the Board's judgment of the overall contributions that a candidate will bring to the Board, giving due weight to diverse personal characteristics that contribute to the Board achieving the objectives of the Diversity Policy. 
The Nominating Committee is charged with reviewing all steps taken pursuant to the Diversity Policy on an annual basis, assessing the Board's progress in achieving diversity, and presenting its findings and assessment to the full Board for input. In its 2018 annual assessment, the Nominating Committee noted the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In January 2018, the Board appointed two diverse candidates as directors of the Board. Maria Contreras-Sweet is  the Board's first Hispanic female director, and Jonathan D. Brown is the Board's first director under the age of 40.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In February 2018, the Board adopted the Diversity Policy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In March 2018, the Company included in its proxy statement a matrix that prominently lists each director's  skills, experience, and demographic background, including diverse characteristics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Throughout 2018, directors added diverse candidates to the director candidate list required to be maintained by  the Diversity Policy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the Board is comprised of Hispanic American directors.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee and the Board are proud of the diverse characteristics of the Company's directors and will continue to promote diversity initiatives at the Board level and throughout the Company.

Knitzer, and Carlos Palomares, with Mr. de Molina serving as Chair of the Board. Each of these individuals has also been nominated as a director candidate for election at the Annual Meeting.

Board Independence 
Ms. Contreras-Sweet and Messrs. Brown, Campos, Freiberg, de Molina, and Palomares are each independent in accordance with the criteria established by the NYSE for independent board members. The Board performed a review to determine the independence of its members and made a subjective determination as to each of these independent directors that no transactions, relationships, or arrangements exist that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director of the Company. In making these determinations, the Board reviewed the information provided by the directors and the Company with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to the Company and its management. We define an "independent" director in accordance with Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Rules. The categorical standards that the Board has established to assist it in making independence determinations can be found in our Corporate Governance Guidelines on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. 
Leadership Structure 
As described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board may select its Chair and our Chief Executive Officer in any way that it considers to be in our best interests. Therefore, the Board does not have a policy on whether the roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined and, if they are to be separate, whether the Chair should be selected from the independent directors. 
Mr. de Molina currently serves as Chair of our Board. At this time, the Board believes that the separation of the roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer promotes communication between the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, and other senior management, and enhances the Board's oversight of management. We believe that our leadership structure provides increased accountability of our Chief Executive Officer to the Board and encourages balanced decision-making. We also separate the roles in recognition of the differences in the roles. While the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for day-to-day leadership of the Company and the setting of strategic direction, the Chair of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and coordinates and manages the operation of the Board and its committees. 
At this time, the Board believes that its current leadership structure, with an independent Chair of the Board, is appropriate for the Company and provides many advantages to the effective operation of the Board. The Board will periodically evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of this leadership structure. 
Meetings 
The Board held 18 meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, each director attended more than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served. In addition to formal Board meetings, our Board communicates from time to time via telephone, electronic mail, and informal meetings, and our Board and its committees may act by written consent in lieu of a formal meeting. Our non-employee directors met in executive session following each of our regular, quarterly Board meetings in 2018, and the independent members of our Board also periodically met in executive session in 2018. Mr. de Molina presides over each executive session of our non-employee directors and independent directors. 
Other than an expectation set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that each director will make every effort to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, we do not have a formal policy regarding the directors' attendance at annual meetings. All of our directors attended our last annual meeting of stockholders held on April 25, 2018. 
Committees of the Board 
Our Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our Board.

The Compensation Committee Charter, which contains a more complete explanation of the roles and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee, is posted on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. A stockholder may request a copy of the Compensation Committee Charter by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
Our Nominating Committee consists of Mr. Campos (Chair), Ms. Contreras-Sweet, and Mr. de Molina. Ms. Contreras-Sweet was appointed to the Nominating Committee in January 2018, replacing Mr. Palomares. In accordance with NYSE rules, each of the members of our Nominating Committee is an independent director in accordance with the criteria established by the NYSE for the purpose of corporate governance and nominating committee membership independence. Pursuant to the Nominating Committee's written charter, the Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assisting our Board in identifying prospective director nominees and recommending nominees to the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the evaluation of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing developments in corporate governance practices and developing, recommending, and maintaining a set of  corporate governance guidelines; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommending members for each committee of our Board.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee will consider a candidate for director proposed by a stockholder. A candidate must be highly qualified and be both willing to serve and expressly interested in serving on the Board. A stockholder wishing to propose a candidate for the Nominating Committee's consideration in connection with the Company's 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting") should forward the candidate's name and information about the candidate's qualifications to Regional Management Corp., 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651, Attn: Corporate Secretary, not earlier than December 27, 2019 nor later than January 
 26, 2020. If, following the filing and delivery of these proxy materials, the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 20 calendar days from the one-year anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, we will, in a timely manner, provide notice to our stockholders of the new date of the 2020 Annual Meeting and the new dates by which stockholder proposals submitted both pursuant to and outside of SEC Rule 14a-8 must be received by the Company. Such notice will be included in the earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Part II, Item 5. 
The Nominating Committee will select individuals, including candidates proposed by stockholders, as director nominees who have the highest personal and professional integrity, who have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment, and who will be most effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of our stockholders. In evaluating nominees, the Nominating Committee will consider, among other things, the director qualifications described above and will apply the objectives outlined in the Diversity Policy. 
The Nominating Committee Charter, which contains a more complete explanation of the roles and responsibilities of the Nominating Committee, is posted on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. A stockholder may request a copy of the Nominating Committee Charter by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651. The Nominating Committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Role in Risk Oversight 
As part of its role in risk oversight, our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing our risk assessment and risk management practices, and for discussing its findings with both management and our independent registered public accounting firm. The Board and the Audit Committee periodically review the risks that may potentially affect us, as identified and presented by management, including risks reflected in our periodic filings. For example, on a periodic basis, members of the Board and the Audit Committee engage with management and/or third-party consultants to assess the cyber threat landscape, to evaluate our information security program, to review the results of penetration testing, and to analyze the design, effectiveness, and ongoing enhancement of our capabilities to monitor, prevent, and respond to cyber threats and events. The Board may also request supplemental information and disclosure about any other specific area of interest and concern relevant to risks it believes are faced by us and our business. 
The Board believes that our current leadership structure enhances its oversight of risk management because our Chief Executive Officer, who is ultimately responsible for our risk management process, is in the best position to discuss with the Board these key risks and management's response to them by also serving as a director of the Company. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Ethics"). The Code of Ethics applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees and must be acknowledged in writing by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In February 2018, the Board approved certain amendments to the Code of Ethics, which were intended to update and bring the Code of Ethics more in line with current best practices. The Code of Ethics is posted on our Investor Relations website at www.regionalmanagement.com. A stockholder may request a copy of the Code of Ethics by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina 29651. To the extent permissible under applicable law, the rules of the SEC, and NYSE listing standards, we intend to disclose on our website any amendment to our Code of Ethics, or any grant of a waiver from a provision of our Code of Ethics, that requires disclosure under applicable laws, the rules of the SEC, or NYSE listing standards. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Mr. Campos, Ms. Contreras-Sweet, Mr. Freiberg, and Mr. Palomares served on our Compensation Committee, with Ms. Contreras-Sweet having been appointed to the Compensation Committee in October 2018. No member of the Compensation Committee has ever served as an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or had any relationship during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. In addition, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or equivalent) or the board of directors of another entity whose executive officer(s) served on our Board or Compensation Committee. 
Communications with the Board 
Each member of the Board is receptive to and welcomes communications from our stockholders and other interested parties. Stockholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of the Board, including, without limitation, the Chair of the Board, any independent director, or the independent directors as a group, by addressing such communications or concerns to our Corporate Secretary, 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina, 29651, who will forward such communications to the appropriate party. 
If a complaint or concern involves accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, the correspondence will be forwarded to the chair of the Audit Committee. If no particular director is named, such communication will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, to the chair of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, or Nominating Committee, as appropriate. 
Anyone who has concerns regarding (i) questionable accounting, internal accounting controls, and auditing matters, including those regarding the circumvention or attempted circumvention of internal accounting controls or that would otherwise constitute a violation of our accounting policies, (ii) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, or (iii) retaliation against employees who voice such concerns, may communicate these concerns by writing to the attention of the Audit Committee as set forth above, or by calling (800) 224-2330 at any time. 
Director Compensation 
Quality non-employee directors are critical to our success. We believe that the two primary duties of non-employee directors are to effectively represent the long-term interests of our stockholders and to provide guidance to management. As such, our compensation program for non-employee directors is designed to meet several key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adequately compensate directors for their responsibilities and time commitments and for the personal  liabilities and risks that they face as directors of a public company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract the highest caliber non-employee directors by offering a  compensation program consistent with those at companies of similar size, complexity, and business character;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of directors with our stockholders by providing a significant portion of compensation  in equity and requiring directors to own our stock; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation that is simple and transparent to stockholders and reflects corporate governance best  practices.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of the Compensation Committee's executive compensation consultant, reviews the compensation of our non-employee directors. In benchmarking director compensation, we use the same compensation peer group that is used to benchmark compensation for our named executive officers (see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Compensation Objectives and Approaches – Compensation Determination Process" for information about the peer group). 
Our employees who serve as directors receive no separate compensation for service on the Board or on committees of the Board. We maintain a non-employee director compensation program structured as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Cash Retainer: Prior to April 25, 2018, each  non-employee director received an annual cash retainer of $30,000 payable in quarterly installments ($50,000 in the case of the chair or lead independent director, if applicable, of the Board). Effective  April 25, 2018, the annual cash retainer increased to $70,000 ($90,000 in the case of the chair or lead independent director, if applicable, of the Board).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Committee Member Cash Retainer: Prior to April 25, 2018, each member of the Audit Committee,  Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 payable in quarterly installments ($20,000 in the case of the chair of each committee). Effective April 25, 2018, the additional annual cash  retainer decreased to $8,750 ($17,500 in the case of the chair of each committee).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Committee Meeting Fees: Prior to April 25, 2018, each member of the Audit Committee, Compensation  Committee, and Nominating Committee received a $1,500 meeting fee for each committee meeting attended. Effective April 25, 2018, we no longer pay committee meeting fees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Equity-Based Award: Each non-employee director receives, on  an annual basis, shares of restricted common stock with a value equal to $90,000 ($110,000 in the case of the chair or lead independent director, if applicable, of the Board).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Committee Member Equity-Based Award: Prior to April 25, 2018, each member of the Audit Committee,  Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee received, on an annual basis, additional shares of restricted common stock with a value equal to $10,000 ($20,000 in the case of the chair of each committee). Effective April 25, 2018, committee  members instead receive additional shares of restricted common stock with a value equal to $8,750 ($17,500 in the case of the chair of each committee).  
[END TABLE]
The restricted stock awards (each, an "RSA") are granted on the fifth business day following the date of the annual stockholders' meeting at which directors are elected. The number of shares subject to the RSA is determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price per share of common stock on the grant date (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The RSA vests and becomes non-forfeitable as to 100% of the underlying shares on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date or the date of the next annual stockholders' meeting, subject to the director's continued service from the grant date until the vesting date, or upon the earlier occurrence of the director's termination of service as a director by reason of death or disability or upon a change in control of the Company. In the event of the director's termination of service for any other reason, the director forfeits the RSA immediately. The RSA is subject to the terms and conditions of the Regional Management Corp. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, effective April 27, 2017) (the "2015 Plan") and an RSA agreement, the form of which was previously approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board and filed with the SEC. 
Under the 2015 Plan, the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to awards granted during any 12-month period to a non-employee director, taken together with any cash fees paid during such 12-month period to such non-employee director in respect of Board service, may not exceed $600,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such awards based on the fair market value per share of common stock on the grant date of the award). In the event that the service of a director as a director, committee member, or Board or committee chair commences or terminates during the director's annual service to us, the director's cash compensation will be adjusted on a pro-rata basis. Annual service relates to the approximately 12-month period between our annual meetings of stockholders. Each director is also reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with his or her service on our Board, including the cost of attending continuing education seminars related to corporate board of directors service and other topics relevant to the Company. 
The following table provides information regarding the compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors for their service as non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The following discussion of the compensation arrangements of our executive officers should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. Actual compensation programs that we adopt following the date of this Proxy Statement may differ materially from the existing and currently planned programs summarized in this discussion. 
Executive Summary of Compensation Programs 
Company Performance and Business Highlights in 2018 
We produced another set of strong operating and financial results in 2018, including double-digit growth of our loan portfolio, total revenue, and diluted earnings per share. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Loan Portfolio Growth: Our loan portfolio grew by $115 million to $932 million, an increase of  14.0% from the prior year—our fourth consecutive year of double-digit portfolio growth. Our core portfolio of small and large installment loans grew by 21.1%, led by continued, significant expansion in our large loan category.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased Revenues and Improved Receivable Efficiency Ratio: Revenues of $307 million in 2018 were up  12.6% from 2017, while operating expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables decreased to 16.4% in 2018 from 17.6% in 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased Earnings: Net income for 2018 was $35.3 million and diluted EPS was $2.93, increases of  18.0% and 15.4%, respectively, from 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Stock Price Growth: Our stock price at the close of 2018 was $24.05, down from $26.31 at the end  of 2017 but up sharply from our stock price of $15.47 at the end of 2015.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, in 2018, we achieved a number of other operating milestones. In February, we completed our transition to a new loan origination and servicing system, a process that began in 2015. Our new system has allowed us to introduce electronic payments, texting and imaging capabilities, an online customer portal, improved lead management, and automated underwriting across our branch network. In the second half of 2018, we began to integrate custom credit models into our automated underwriting processes, which we believe provide a significant improvement over the previous criteria used for underwriting. We also continued to diversify our funding sources in 2018 by closing our first asset-backed securitization ("ABS") transaction in June, followed by a second ABS transaction in December. Finally, in September and October, we expanded our geographic presence by entering our 10th and 11th states of operation, Missouri and Wisconsin. 
We were pleased with our 2018 results, and we believe that the compensation paid to our named executive officers (our "NEOs") for 2018 appropriately reflects and rewards their contributions to our performance. 
Compensation Program Highlights in 2018 
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we included a proposal that provided our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs. Because we only ceased to be an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act in 2018, this was our first annual meeting of stockholders that included such a "say-on-pay" proposal. We were pleased to report that our stockholders' approval of our NEOs' compensation was nearly unanimous, with 99.8% of voted shares having been voted in favor of approval. 
In 2018, our Compensation Committee carefully reviewed our executive compensation program to ensure that it is designed to achieve its intended objectives and continues to reflect executive compensation "best practices." In light of the numerous improvements to our executive compensation program in the years prior to 2018 and our stockholders' overwhelming support of the program, our Compensation Committee determined not to make any material changes to our executive compensation program in 2018. In making its determination, our Compensation Committee received advice from its independent compensation consultant, Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants ("Veritas"). 
Compensation Program Best Practices 
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract and retain talented executives to effectively manage and lead our company and to create long-term stockholder value. We compensate our executive officers primarily through a mix of base salary, performance-based annual cash awards, and service- and performance-based long-term incentive awards. Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, a substantial portion of our executives' compensation is at risk and linked to the successful performance and management of our company, as measured against rigorous performance goals established by our Compensation Committee. Our 2018 executive compensation program continued to include a number of best compensation practices, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Alignment of executive pay with company performance:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ⚬     2018 incentives are largely performance-contingent, with long-term incentive awards roughly two-thirds performance-contingent and short-term incentive awards entirely performance-contingent

  ◾    2018 short-term incentive program performance goals were largely achieved, resulting in annual bonus  payments at 99.7% of target bonuses  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Aligning Pay with Performance 
We believe that a substantial portion of our executive officers' compensation should be tied to their performance and the short- and long-term financial and operating results of our company. 
We developed our long-term incentive program in 2014 in consultation with Veritas. In 2013, our Chief Executive Officer and the majority of our NEOs did not receive any long-term incentive awards. In addition, when we appointed a new Chief Executive Officer in late October 2014, he did not receive any long-term incentive awards until we finalized his employment agreement in 2015. As a result, the annualized total direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officers who were serving at the end of 2013 and 2014 was substantially below both the median of our peer group and our current Chief Executive Officer's total direct compensation. We believe that the creation and evolution of our long-term incentive program since 2014 has been critical to our ability to link our executives' pay with the performance of our company, to align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders, and to remain competitive in the marketplace for executive talent. 
Our executive compensation program now embodies our pay-for-performance philosophy and closely ties the interests of our key executives to those of our stockholders. We heavily weight our executive officers' compensation in performance-based short- and long-term incentive awards that are designed to reward exceptional performance. The following table describes the program design for each element of our incentive-based pay in 2018. 
Pay Elements Program Design Short-Term Incentive Program Consists entirely of performance-based awards: Metrics include net income from operations, average finance receivables, net credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables, total net debt/EBITDA, total general and administrative expense percentage, and an analysis by our Compensation Committee of our executives' execution against short-term strategic objectives Motivates our executives and brings total cash opportunities to competitive levels Significant upside opportunity for high performance, but with a challenging threshold Long-Term Incentive Program Consists of performance-contingent RSUs, cash-settled performance units, and non-qualified stock options: Vesting of performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units is based primarily on the CAGRs of net income and basic earnings per share, respectively, compared to our peer group over a three-year performance period Two-thirds of grant date fair value is in the form of performance-contingent awards Provides strong incentive to meet or exceed pre-established long-term financial goals that align with long-term stockholder interests, and is utilized to attract, retain, and motivate executive talent 
The compensation packages of our Chief Executive Officer and our other NEOs are closely aligned with performance. For 2018, the majority of compensation was variable and performance-based: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer Target Pay Mix     Other NEO Average Target Pay Mix 
 Chief Executive Officer Target Pay Mix     Other NEO Average Target Pay Mix 
[END TABLE]
Note: The Other NEO target pay mix set forth above is the average for Messrs. Schachtel, Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher. For Mr. Schachtel, we have used his aggregate target pay mix for 2017 (partial year) and 2018, as set forth in his employment agreement and more fully described below. The presentation excludes perquisites, which are an immaterial component of our executives' compensation. 
Results of Short- and Long-Term Incentive Programs 
Our short-term incentive program provides our executives with the opportunity to earn performance-based annual cash awards pursuant to our Annual Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "Annual Incentive Plan"). The achievement and payment of annual cash awards in 2018 was tied directly to our financial and operational performance, based primarily (85%) on clearly-defined, objective performance measures and, to a lesser extent (15%), on our Compensation Committee's assessment of our executive team's achievement of its short-term strategic objectives. For 2018, our executive officers were paid 99.7% of their target annual bonuses (out of a range of 0% to 150%) under our Annual Incentive Plan as a result of our strong financial and operating results and the execution of certain key strategic objectives, including the rollout of custom credit scorecards and the closing of two ABS transactions. 
In recent years, our long-term incentive program has provided for the delivery of long-term incentive awards through a combination of three award vehicles: (i) non-qualified stock options, (ii) performance-contingent RSUs, and (iii) cash-settled performance units. Vesting of each of the performance-contingent awards is subject to, among other things, the achievement of performance objectives over a three-year performance period that begins on January 1st of the grant year. The three-year performance period established under the 2016 long-term incentive program ended on December 31, 2018. Vesting of the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units granted in 2016 was based primarily (90%) on our CAGRs of net income (in the case of the performance-contingent RSUs) and basic earnings per share (in the case of the cash-settled performance units) compared to our peer group over the three-year performance period, and to a lesser extent (10%) on our Compensation Committee's assessment of our executive team's achievement of its long-term strategic objectives over the same time period. In March 2019, as described in greater detail below, based upon results achieved during the performance period, our Compensation Committee determined that participants in the 2016 long-term incentive program earned 116.5% of their target performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units. 
Stockholder Outreach and Engagement 
Stockholder outreach is a central feature of our investor relations philosophy. We provide numerous opportunities for current and prospective stockholders to gain access to our management team through attendance at investor conferences, one-on-one in-person meetings, and telephone calls. Through these interactions, we are able to educate current and prospective investors about our company, learn about concerns of stockholders, and provide investors with a better understanding of our business model and philosophy. We also receive valuable feedback from investors on topics including strategy, corporate governance, and compensation, which the Board and management take into consideration in making future business and compensation decisions. 
Since our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we reached out to institutional investors owning more than 60% of our outstanding common stock (as of September 30, 2018), specifically for the purpose of receiving their feedback regarding executive compensation practices and corporate governance matters. Based on the feedback received, we have made and expect to continue to make certain changes to our compensation and corporate governance practices and disclosures. For example, in the past, certain investors requested that we increase the percentage of independent directors on our Board and improve the gender diversity of our Board. In response, we added two new independent directors in 2018, including Maria Contreras-Sweet, and adopted a Board Diversity Policy. See "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Matters – Board Diversity." Independent directors now hold 75% of our Board seats. In addition, certain investors expressed concern that we had granted retention awards in consecutive years (2015 and 2016) to certain executives pursuant to our key employee retention program. In response, we did not grant any retention awards to executive officers in 2017 or 2018. More recently, in early 2019, investors suggested that we consider certain amendments to our Bylaws and that we re-evaluate the performance metrics and relative weightings within our short-term incentive program. Our Board will consider this investor feedback in 2019. 
In 2019 and beyond, we expect to continue our stockholder outreach, including by making ourselves available to hear stockholder feedback regarding executive compensation and corporate governance practices. 
Compensation Objectives and Approaches 
Compensation Program Objectives 
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract and retain talented executives to effectively manage and lead our company and to create long-term stockholder value. The compensation packages for our executive officers for 2018 generally included a base salary, performance-based annual cash awards, service- and performance-based long-term incentive awards, and other benefits. Our current compensation program for our executive officers has been designed based on our view that each component of executive compensation should be set at levels that are necessary, within reasonable parameters, to successfully attract and retain skilled executives and that are fair and equitable in light of market practices. 
Base salaries are intended to provide a minimum, fixed level of cash compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team when considered in combination with other components of our executive compensation program. The base salary element is meant to provide our executive officers with a stable income stream that is commensurate with their responsibilities and to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year. 
Consistent with our pay-for-performance strategy, our performance-based annual cash incentive program is customized to achieve specific objectives, reward increased levels of operational success, and place emphasis on appropriate levels of performance measurement. The key goals addressed by our short-term incentive program include (1) achievement of short-term financial and operational objectives, (2) increased stockholder value, (3) motivation and attraction of key management talent, (4) rewarding key contributors for performance against established criteria, and (5) focusing on our pay-for-performance compensation strategy. Benefits earned under our short-term incentive program are paid under our Annual Incentive Plan. 
Our long-term incentive program, which for 2018 included non-qualified stock options, performance-contingent RSUs, and cash-settled performance units, operates in tandem with our short-term incentive program and is consistent with our pay-for-performance strategy. Performance-based long-term incentives and service-based option awards can provide significant benefits to both our employees and stockholders. These long-term incentives generally are intended to create (1) a strong sense of ownership, (2) focus on achievement of long-term, strategic business objectives, (3) an enhanced linkage between the interests of our executives and stockholders, (4) an enhanced relationship between pay and performance, and (5) an incentive to attract and retain superior employees. Long-term incentive program benefits are issued under our 2015 Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders and re-approved, as amended and restated, at our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. 
The discussion below includes a review of our compensation program for 2018 and a preview of certain aspects of our compensation program for 2019. Our NEOs for 2018 were: 
Peter R. Knitzer President and Chief Executive Officer John D. Schachtel Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Donald E. Thomas Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Daniel J. Taggart Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Risk Officer Brian J. Fisher Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary 
Compensation Determination Process 
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation determinations for all of our executive officers. In setting an executive officer's compensation package and the relative allocation among different types of compensation, we consider the nature of the position, the scope of associated responsibilities, the individual's prior experience and skills, and the individual's compensation expectations, as well as the compensation of our existing executive officers and our general impressions of prevailing conditions in the market for executive talent. 
Engagement and Use of an Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to hire outside advisors and experts, including compensation consultants, to assist it with director and executive officer compensation determinations. Since 2014, the Compensation Committee has retained the services of Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants, an independent compensation consultant, to ensure that our compensation practices are appropriate for our industry, to review and to make recommendations with respect to executive officer and director cash and equity compensation, and to update our peer group, in each case for the Compensation Committee's use in setting compensation. 
Veritas' recommendations to the Compensation Committee were generally in the form of suggested ranges of compensation or descriptions of policies that Veritas currently considers "best practice" in our industry and for publicly-traded companies. The Compensation Committee used Veritas' reports to further its understanding of executive officer cash and equity compensation practices in the market. 
During 2018, Veritas worked only for the Compensation Committee and performed no additional services for the Company or any of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee Chair approved all work performed by Veritas. During 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Company did not use the services of any other compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee has also engaged Veritas in 2019 to provide similar services. 
Our Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Veritas, taking into account, among other things, the factors set forth in NYSE rules, and has concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the work Veritas performed or performs for our Compensation Committee and that Veritas is independent under NYSE rules. 
Establishment and Use of a Peer Group 
We generally monitor compensation practices in the markets where we compete for executive talent to obtain an overview of market practices and to ensure that we make informed decisions on executive pay packages. For 2018 compensation decisions, to obtain a sense of the market and a general understanding of current compensation practices, we reviewed the compensation awarded by a peer group of publicly-traded companies. In addition, as described in greater detail below, the vesting of certain of our executives' long-term incentive awards is determined based upon our financial performance compared to the financial performance of our peer group over a three-year performance period. 
At the outset of 2018, based upon prior peer group reviews conducted with the assistance of Veritas, our peer group consisted of the following companies:

In the third quarter of 2018, with assistance from Veritas, we reviewed our peer group using a scorecard-based approach that involved applying several filters (e.g., strong financial health, positive shareholder standing, similar in size, similar in industry classification, presence of overlapping peers, identification as a peer by a proxy advisory firm) and selecting the most qualified peer companies from a broader list of candidates. Based on the evaluation, our Compensation Committee determined to remove Asta Funding, Inc., Capstead Mortgage Corporation, and NewStar Financial, Inc. from our peer group and to add Elevate Credit, Inc. and LendingClub Corporation to our peer group. 
 As a result, our new peer group for 2019 consists of the following companies. As of the time that the Compensation Committee approved our new peer group, we were in the 2nd quartile of the peer group based on revenue, market capitalization, and enterprise value.

Elements of Compensation 
Each executive officer is eligible to receive a balance of variable and fixed compensation. The following table describes the various forms of compensation used in 2018: 
Pay Elements Component(s) Rationale for Form of Compensation Base Salary Cash To attract and retain executive talent To provide a fixed base of compensation generally aligned to peer group levels Short-Term Incentive Performance-based annual cash bonus To drive the achievement of key business results on an annual basis To recognize individual executives based on their specific and measurable contributions To structure a meaningful amount of at-risk, performance-based annual compensation Long-Term Incentive Performance-based long-term incentives: Performance-contingent RSUs Cash-settled performance units Service-based long-term incentives: Non-qualified stock options To drive the sustainable achievement of key long-term business results To align the interests of executives with stockholders To structure a meaningful amount of at-risk, performance-based long-term compensation To attract, retain, and motivate executive talent 
Base Salary 
Annual base salaries are established on the basis of market conditions at the time we hire an executive, as well as by taking into account the particular executive's level of qualifications and experience. The Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers annually, and any subsequent modifications to annual base salaries are made in consideration of the appropriateness of each executive officer's compensation, both individually and relative to the other executive officers, the individual performance of each executive officer, and any significant changes in market conditions. We do not apply specific formulas to determine increases. 
The Compensation Committee approved executive officer annual base salaries for 2017, 2018, and 2019 as described in the following table. Annual base salaries are pro-rated for any partial year. 
Name 2017 Base Salary 2018 Base Salary 2019 Base Salary 2019 Base Salary Percentile Rank Relative to Peer Companies Peter R. Knitzer $530,000 $550,000 $600,000 43rd John D. Schachtel $350,000 $360,000 $400,000 39th Donald E. Thomas $342,000 $355,000 $400,000 28th Daniel J. Taggart $318,000 $330,000 $375,000 34th Brian J. Fisher $240,000 $300,000 $335,000 15th 
In February 2018, in recognition of his performance and service to our company, the Board promoted Mr. Fisher from Vice President to Senior Vice President and increased his base salary accordingly. At the time of the increase in 2018, Mr. Fisher's base salary remained below the 25th percentile relative to 5th-ranked NEOs in our peer group. In February 2019, following a total compensation analysis conducted by Veritas in late 2018, the Compensation Committee elected to increase each executive officer's base salary in order to better align their base salaries with those paid by peer companies. Following these increases in 2019, as noted above, our executive officers' base salaries ranged between the 15th and 43rd percentile relative to comparable executive officers at peer companies. 
Our Compensation Committee believes that it has set base salaries at appropriate levels to attract and retain effective executives and that base salaries, when combined with short- and long-term incentives, are an important component of a holistic compensation approach. 
Performance-Based Annual Cash Awards 
Our annual incentive program is designed to drive achievement of annual corporate goals, including key financial and operating results and strategic goals that create long-term stockholder value. Our executive officers are eligible for performance-based annual cash awards linked to performance targets set by our Compensation Committee. 
Components of Annual Incentive Program 
The awards for 2018 were based primarily (85%) on our performance with respect to the metrics in the following table. The metrics in the table below drive the overall performance of our business from year to year and are elements of our historical financial success. 
Performance Metric What it Measures Rationale for Metric Net Income from Operations Profitability Measures the effectiveness of our management team's execution of our strategic and operational plans Reflects business variables and factors that are within management's control or are influenced by decisions made by executives Average Finance Receivables Loan growth Measures our ability to grow our business We establish annual growth objectives for our management team for loans that we originate and service Net Credit Losses as a Percentage of Average Finance Receivables Loan portfolio control Measures the control our management team exerts on our loan portfolio It is ultimately a measure of the quality of underwriting policies and decisions and the effectiveness of collection efforts We guide our management team to specific aggregate net credit loss goals each year that, combined with our average finance receivables measure, attempt to balance attractive growth with effective portfolio control Total Net Debt / EBITDA Leverage ratio Measures reliance on our credit facilities to produce cash flow Holds management accountable for the responsible use of credit to fund our business Total General and Administrative Expense Percentage Expense control Measures the effectiveness with which our management team utilizes our corporate resources and minimizes our corporate expenses 
Note: We calculate EBITDA as consolidated net income from operations before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, each as calculated in accordance with GAAP and as set forth in our audited financial statements. 
Our 2018 annual incentive awards were based to a lesser extent (15%) on our Compensation Committee's assessment of our executive team's achievement of its short-term strategic objectives. In light of ongoing, significant strategic projects and initiatives, our Compensation Committee believes that it is important to appropriately incentivize the achievement of strategic objectives (which often cannot be measured quantitatively) by linking their achievement (and the quality thereof) to our executives' compensation. 
Annual Incentive Program Performance Targets, Results, and Payouts 
The following table provides for 2018 detail regarding the threshold and target levels of performance set by the Compensation Committee for each performance metric, the weighting applied to each metric, our actual annual performance pursuant to each metric, and the percentage payout for each metric and in total. A threshold level of performance must be exceeded in order to earn any award, and each executive is eligible to earn up to 150% of his target award based upon the achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. 
Performance Metric Threshold Performance Target Performance Maximum Performance Actual Performance Percentage Weight Percentage Payout Net Income from Operations $27,335,077 $39,050,110 $46,860,132 $35,344,473 30.0% 29.0% Average Finance Receivables $769,489,639 $854,988,487 $940,487,336 $857,906,704 20.0% 20.3% Net Credit Losses Percentage 9.99% 8.69% 7.39% 9.05% 15.0% 12.8% Total Debt / EBITDA 7.60x 6.34x 5.07x 6.99x 10.0% 8.6% Total G&A Expense Percentage 49.88% 46.40% 42.92% 45.74% 10.0% 11.0% Achievement of Strategic Objectives N/A N/A N/A N/A 15.0% 18.0% 100.0% 99.7% 
In calculating the percentage payout above, the Compensation Committee adjusted actual results to account for the impact of Hurricane Florence, which was beyond the reasonable control of management. Had the Compensation Committee not made an adjustment, the total percentage payout would have instead been 94.9% of target. The Compensation Committee believes that its decision to adjust actual results in 2018 is appropriately balanced against its decision in the prior year to adjust actual results in a manner that caused the percentage payout under the 2017 annual incentive program to be less than it otherwise would have been in the absence of such adjustments. Additional information regarding the estimated impact of Hurricane Florence on our results of operations, including our net income and net credit losses, may be found in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
As described above, 15% of the total annual incentive program award opportunity is linked to our Compensation Committee's assessment of our executive team's achievement of its short-term strategic objectives. For 2018, our Compensation Committee elected to pay 120% of this award opportunity in recognition of our company's outstanding execution of its short-term strategic objectives, including the development of custom credit scorecards, the closing of our first two ABS transactions in June 2018 and December 2018, the expansion of our branch footprint to two new states, the completion of the implementation of our new loan origination and servicing platform in each of our branches, and the continued improvements in our management of enterprise risks. 
Target annual incentive levels and actual performance-based annual cash awards for each of our NEOs for 2018 are detailed below, based upon the 99.7% performance achievement detailed above. 
Name 2018 Eligible Base Salary 2018 Target Award as% of Salary Target Award Actual Award Peter R. Knitzer $550,000 100% $550,000 $548,350 John D. Schachtel $360,000 100% $360,000 $358,920 Donald E. Thomas $355,000 100% $355,000 $353,935 Daniel J. Taggart $330,000 100% $330,000 $329,010 Brian J. Fisher $300,000 100% $300,000 $299,100 
The target award percentages described above were determined by the Compensation Committee and are calibrated so that the total compensation opportunity for each executive officer is commensurate with that executive's role and responsibilities with us. Except in the case of Mr. Thomas, if an executive voluntarily terminates his employment during the performance year, he becomes ineligible to receive payment of a performance-based annual cash award. Pursuant to his retirement agreement, Mr. Thomas will be eligible to receive a pro-rated, performance-based annual cash award based upon the number of days of service in 2019, subject to our achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for 2019. See "Summary of Employment Arrangements with Executive Officers – Retirement Agreement with Chief Financial Officer." 
Annual Incentive Program Opportunities in 2019 
Our Compensation Committee has not yet acted to establish the parameters of our annual incentive program for 2019. However, we currently expect that it will be structured in a manner similar to the 2018 program, provided that our Compensation Committee is considering the re-allocation of the weighting of certain of the metrics and the replacement of the "Total Debt / EBITDA" performance metric with a metric that instead measures our return on assets. We further expect that the target 2019 incentive levels for each of our executive officers will be set at 150% of base salary in the case of Mr. Knitzer and 100% of base salary in the case of each other executive officer. 
Our Compensation Committee believes that our short-term incentive program is effective in motivating our executives to achieve short-term financial and operational objectives, in furtherance of our pay-for-performance compensation strategy. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Our long-term incentive award grants are intended to directly align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders, to give our executive officers a strong incentive to maximize stockholder returns on a long-term basis, and to aid in our recruitment and retention of key executive talent necessary to ensure our continued success. 
Components of Long-Term Incentive Program 
In 2016 through 2018, our long-term incentive program provided for the delivery of long-term incentive awards through a combination of three award vehicles: (i) non-qualified stock options, (ii) performance-contingent RSUs, and (iii) cash-settled performance units. Vesting of each of the performance-contingent awards is subject to, among other things, the achievement of performance objectives over a three-year performance period that begins on January 1st of the grant year. Long-term incentive awards are scheduled to occur in the first quarter of each year. 
In 2018, as part of the long-term incentive program, we granted the following awards in the first quarter of 2018 to Messrs. Knitzer, Schachtel, Thomas, Taggart, Fisher, and other key employees: 
LTI Vehicle Principal Performance Metric Performance Period Weighting Recipients Non-Qualified Stock Options Built-in metric of stock price growth N/A – Options vest in equal installments on December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, subject to continued employment One-third of total target award Executive officers and several other key C-suite employees Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock Units CAGR of net income compared to a peer group Three years, from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 One-third of total target award Executive officers and several other key C-suite employees Cash-Settled Performance Units CAGR of basic earnings per share compared to a peer group Three years, from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 One-third of total target award Executive officers and several other key C-suite employees 
Vesting of the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units is based primarily (90%) upon our performance over the three-year performance period compared to our peer group, as described in the table below. Failure to meet the threshold level of performance results in the forfeiture of the associated award. 
LTI Vehicle Principal Performance Metric Performance Level Required Performance% of Target Award Earned and Vested Performance-Contingent Restricted Stock Units CAGR of net income compared to our peer group for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Threshold Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 50th Percentile 50% Target Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 60th Percentile 100% Maximum Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 75th Percentile 150% Cash-Settled Performance Units CAGR of basic earnings per share compared to our peer group for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 Threshold Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 50th Percentile 50% Target Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 60th Percentile 100% Maximum Performance Meets or Exceeds Peer Group Performance at the 75th Percentile 150% 
To a lesser extent (10%), vesting of the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units is based on our Compensation Committee's assessment of our executive team's achievement of its long-term strategic objectives over the same performance period. In light of ongoing, significant strategic projects and initiatives, our Compensation Committee believes it is important to appropriately incentivize the achievement of strategic objectives (which often cannot be measured quantitatively) by linking their achievement (and the quality thereof) to our executives' compensation. 
Mr. Schachtel became our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer effective as of May 30, 2017. Mr. Schachtel's employment agreement establishes his aggregate long-term incentive compensation opportunity level for 2017 and 2018, and provides that he will be granted long-term incentive award opportunities through a combination of the three award vehicles described above—non-qualified stock options, performance-contingent RSUs, and cash-settled performance units. The aggregate grant date target value of Mr. Schachtel's 2017 and 2018 long-term incentive compensation opportunities is $850,000 (calculated as approximately $525,000 per year on an annualized basis for the period commencing on Mr. Schachtel's first day of employment, May 30, 2017, through the end of 2018). 
Mr. Schachtel's long-term incentive compensation for 2017 and 2018 is split among non-qualified stock options, performance-contingent RSUs, and cash-settled performance units having a grant date target value of $300,000, $275,000, and $275,000, respectively. Because Mr. Schachtel's employment commenced more than 90 days after the beginning of the performance period associated with the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units that we granted under our 2017 long-term incentive program, Mr. Schachtel's participation in the 2017 program with respect to performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units would have resulted in the payment of compensation (if any) that would not have qualified for the performance-based compensation exemption available pursuant to Code Section 162(m). Therefore, in an effort to preserve, to the extent practicable, the future tax deductibility of Mr. Schachtel's compensation, the Compensation Committee approved Mr. Schachtel's non-qualified stock option award with a grant date of May 30, 2017, the date he commenced employment, and determined that the award of Mr. Schachtel's performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units should occur as part of the 2018 long-term incentive program. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards in 2018 and 2019 
The grant date target values for awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 are detailed in the following table. For the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units, a threshold level of performance must be exceeded for the awards to have any value, and participants are eligible to earn up to 150% of their target award based upon the achievement of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. For the non-qualified stock options, our stock price must exceed the exercise price (which is set at our closing stock price on the grant date) for the options to have any value. 
Name 2018 Target Grant Date Value Total Performance-Contingent RSUs Cash-Settled Performance Units Non-Qualified Stock Options Peter R. Knitzer $2,200,000 $733,333 $733,333 $733,334 John D.

Fisher $300,000 $100,000 $100,000 $100,000 
Our long-term incentive program in 2019 is structured in a manner similar to the 2018 program described above, subject to certain exceptions. For 2019, in consultation with Veritas and following a review of peer company practices, our Compensation Committee elected to add a service-based RSA as a fourth component of the program in order to strengthen the retentive nature of the program and to more appropriately balance the allocation of long-term incentive award opportunities between performance-based and service-based awards. The service-based RSA will vest in three equal annual tranches over a three-year period, subject to continued employment through the respective vesting dates. In addition, for 2019, the Compensation Committee did not grant any long-term incentive awards to Mr. Thomas in light of his pending retirement, consistent with the terms of his retirement agreement. Finally, in October 2018, in recognition of his performance and service to our company, the Board promoted Mr. Taggart from Senior Vice President to Executive Vice President and increased his long-term incentive award opportunity accordingly.

Note: The number of shares subject to the performance-contingent RSU awards and the RSAs is determined by dividing the value of the award by the closing price per share of common stock on the grant date (rounded down to the nearest whole share). The number of shares subject to the non-qualified stock option awards is determined by dividing the value of the award by the fair value per share of common stock on the grant date calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model (rounded down to the nearest whole share). 
Our Compensation Committee believes that our long-term incentive program furthers our pay-for-performance objectives, creates a compelling recruitment and retention tool, appropriately focuses our executives on the achievement of long-term financial and business goals, and strengthens the alignment of our executives' interests with those of our stockholders. 
2016 Long-Term Incentive Program Performance Targets, Results, and Payouts 
In 2016, we granted our then-current executive officers non-qualified stock options, performance-contingent RSUs, and cash-settled performance units. Messrs. Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher were employed by us in 2016 and participated in the 2016 long-term incentive program. The three-year performance period established under the 2016 long-term incentive program ended on December 31, 2018. 
Vesting of the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units granted in 2016 was based primarily (90%) on our CAGRs of net income (in the case of the performance-contingent RSUs) and basic earnings per share (in the case of the cash-settled performance units) compared to our 2016 peer group over the three-year performance period. We refer to this portion of the performance-contingent RSU and cash-settled performance unit award opportunities as the "Objective Criteria Units." The Objective Criteria Units were eligible to vest based on our performance relative to our peer group as follows: 
Performance Relative to Peer Group% of Objective Criteria Units Vested < 50th Percentile 0% 50th Percentile 50% 60th Percentile 100% ³ 75th Percentile 150% 
The percentage of the Objective Criteria Units vested for results between the performance levels stated above is calculated using linear interpolation. Our CAGRs of net income and earnings per share compared to our peer group over the performance period were as follows: 
Performance Measure Performance at 25th Percentile of Peer Group Performance at 50th Percentile of Peer Group Performance at 75th Percentile of Peer Group Performance of Regional CAGR of Net Income (50.7%) 12.9% 31.8% 17.8% CAGR of Basic EPS (49.4%) 12.2% 35.3% 21.7% 
In calculating the performance of peer companies, the Compensation Committee excluded discontinued operations, adjusted for the impact of goodwill impairments, and utilized pro-forma financial statements filed by any peer company having made a significant acquisition, in each case as disclosed by the peer companies in their SEC filings. Where a peer company was delisted following poor financial performance, the peer company was ranked at the bottom of the peer group. Where a peer company was acquired by another peer company, the acquired company was removed from the peer group, and where a peer company was acquired by a company outside of the peer group, the acquired company's CAGRs of net income and basic earnings per share were calculated using available information. Our Compensation Committee also elected to remove one peer company from the peer group analysis due to its significant governance failures and financial statement restatements during the performance period, as well as its ongoing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the performance period, all of which called into question the quality and accuracy of the company's reported earnings. Finally, in calculating peer company performance and our performance, the Compensation Committee adjusted actual results to account for the impact of hurricane events. 
Our performance at the above levels resulted in the vesting of 116.7% of the Objective Criteria Units associated with each of the performance-contingent RSU awards and the cash-settled performance unit awards. Our Compensation Committee believes that vesting at these levels appropriately reflects our pay-for-performance strategy and is supported by our total shareholder return. Over the three-year performance period, we finished in the same position within our peer group in each of total shareholder return, CAGR of net income, and CAGR of basic earnings per share. 
Vesting of the performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units granted in 2016 was also based in small part (10%) on our Compensation Committee's qualitative assessment of our executive team's achievement of its long-term strategic objectives between 2016 and 2018. We refer to this portion of the performance-contingent RSU and cash-settled performance unit award opportunities as the "Qualitative Criteria 
 Units." Our Compensation Committee elected to pay 115% of the Qualitative Criteria Units in recognition of, among other achievements, the implementation of our new loan origination and servicing platform in each of our branches; the development of custom credit scorecards; material improvements in our liquidity profile, including through a $100 million increase in capacity under our senior revolving credit facility, the closing of a $125 million revolving warehouse credit facility, and the closing of our first two ABS transactions; the expansion of our branch footprint to two new states; improvements to our compliance management system and enterprise risk management; and the full dismissal in 2018 of the securities class action lawsuit filed against us in 2014. 
Based upon the above results, in March 2019, our Compensation Committee determined that Messrs. Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher vested in and earned 116.5% of their total target performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units under the 2016 long-term incentive program. The following table provides information regarding the percentage of the target performance-contingent RSUs and cash-settled performance units vested under our 2014, 2015, and 2016 long-term incentive programs, which were eligible to vest on December 31st of 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively: 
Long-Term Incentive Program Award Component 2014 Grant Year 2015 Grant Year 2016 Grant Year Performance-Contingent RSUs 0% 0% 116.5% Cash-Settled Performance Units 0% 0% 116.5% 
Key Employee Retention Program 
In 2014, even when including the increased target value of the short- and long-term incentive awards, total compensation levels for our executive officers were below the median of our peer group. Further, the difficulties we faced in 2014 resulted in a significant deficit in terms of realized compensation. As a result, in 2015, our Compensation Committee, in consultation with Veritas, determined to implement a key employee retention program as an incentive and retention vehicle for certain critical executives. 
Pursuant to the key employee retention program, the Compensation Committee granted the following awards to certain executive officers in 2015: (i) non-qualified stock options, which are subject to the terms of the Regional Management Corp. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the "2011 Plan"), and (ii) a cash retention award. In March 2016, the Compensation Committee elected to continue the key employee retention program with grants of the following awards to certain executive officers: (i) RSAs, which are subject to the terms of the 2015 Plan, and (ii) cash retention awards. 
We did not grant any retention awards to our executive officers in 2017 or 2018. 
Perquisites 
We also provide various other limited perquisites and other personal benefits to our executive officers that are intended to be part of a competitive compensation program. For 2018, these benefits included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ability to participate in a comprehensive voluntary annual health screening;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Monthly automobile allowance of $1,150 to Mr. Thomas;

• Mobile phone allowance payments to Messrs. Knitzer, Schachtel, Thomas, and Taggart; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payment of supplemental long-term disability premiums and associated taxes, which is intended, in part, to insure  against our severance obligations in the event of a disability termination event under an executive's employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
We also offer our executive officers benefits that are generally available to all of our employees, including 401(k) plan matching contributions, health insurance, disability insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, paid time off, and the reimbursement of qualified business expenses. The Compensation Committee believes that these benefits are comparable to those offered by other companies that compete with us for executive talent and are consistent with our overall compensation program. Perquisites are not a material part of our compensation program.  
Other Compensation Policies, Practices, and Matters 
Stock Ownership and Retention Policy 
The Compensation Committee believes that significant ownership of common stock by our executives and directors directly aligns their interests with those of our stockholders and also helps to balance the incentives for risk-taking inherent in equity-based awards made to executives. Under our Stock Ownership and Retention Policy, executives and directors are subject to the following ownership guidelines: 
Covered Person Ownership Guideline Chief Executive Officer 5x annual base salary Other covered employees (including NEOs) 2x annual base salary Directors 5x annual cash retainer 
In February 2018, our Compensation Committee increased our director stock ownership requirement from 3x to 5x the annual cash retainer, placing the dollar value of the ownership requirement in the 90th percentile of our peer group. Persons covered by the policy are expected to utilize grants under equity compensation plans to reach the levels of ownership expected by the policy. The policy also incorporates a retention element requiring such persons to retain 50% of the net shares resulting from the vesting or exercise of equity awards to obtain the required ownership under the policy. 
Clawback Policy 
We have also adopted a Compensation Recoupment Policy, or "clawback policy." Under the clawback policy, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, any other person who is an executive officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, and such other persons as may be determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee, may be required to return to us and/or forfeit all or a portion of any cash-based incentive compensation and/or equity-based incentive compensation received by such covered person. 
Such a return or forfeit is required, unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, if (i) compensation is received based on financial statements that are subsequently restated in a way that would decrease the amount of the award to which such person was entitled and the restatement is based in whole or in part on the misconduct of the covered person, (ii) such compensation was received by the covered person and the Compensation Committee determines that such person has violated a non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenant applicable to such person, or (iii) recoupment is otherwise required under applicable law. 
Prohibition Against Hedging and Pledging 
As stated in our Code of Conduct, directors, officers, employees, and their designees may not engage in activities that are designed to profit from trading activity or hedge against decreases in the value of our securities. This includes purchasing any financial instrument or contract, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange traded funds, which is designed to hedge or offset any risk of decrease in the market value of our common stock. These prohibitions apply regardless of whether the equity securities have been granted to the directors, executive officers, or other employees as part of their compensation or are held, directly or indirectly, by such persons or their designees. 
In addition, pursuant to our Stock Ownership and Retention Policy, shares subject to the retention requirements of the policy may not be pledged, hypothecated, or made subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. 
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups 
We did not provide any of our executive officers with a "gross-up" or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability that he might owe as a result of the application of Code Sections 280G, 4999, or 409A during 2018, and we have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any NEO with such a "gross-up" or other reimbursement. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Code Section 162(m) generally limits our ability to deduct for tax purposes compensation over $1,000,000 to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or any one of our other three highest paid executive officers. However, in the case of tax years commencing before 2018, Code Section 162(m) exempted qualifying performance-based compensation from the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Code Section 162(m) was amended in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to eliminate the exemption for performance-based compensation (other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017, that are not materially modified after that date and that would otherwise have been deductible under Code Section 162(m) prior to the changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and to expand the group of current and former executive officers who may be covered by the deduction limit under Code Section 162(m). As a result, compensation paid to certain of our executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will no longer be deductible (other than with respect to certain "grandfathered" arrangements, as noted above). Notwithstanding the elimination of the exemption for performance-based compensation, because of the importance of linking pay and performance, our 2018 and 2019 executive compensation programs continue to impose performance conditions on a significant portion of awards to our executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee will review and consider the deductibility of executive compensation under Code Section 162(m) and may authorize certain payments that will be in excess of the $1,000,000 limitation. The Compensation Committee believes that it needs to balance the benefits of designing awards that are tax-deductible with the need to design awards that attract, retain, and reward executives responsible for our success. While mindful of the benefit to us of the full deductibility of compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of Code Section 162(m) where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives, which the Compensation Committee believes aligns our executive officers' interests with our stockholders' interests, and thus is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
Payments Upon Termination and Change-in-Control 
Pursuant to the terms of each of their employment agreements and certain long-term incentive award agreements, our NEOs are entitled to certain benefits upon the termination of their employment with us, the terms of which are described below under "Summary of Employment Arrangements with Executive Officers." 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices 
We have assessed our compensation programs for all employees and have concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. We believe that our compensation programs reflect an appropriate mix of compensation elements and balance current and long-term performance objectives, cash and equity compensation, and risks and rewards. During 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all employees, including our NEOs, particularly as they relate to risk management practices and risk-taking incentives. As part of its review, the Compensation Committee discussed with management the ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated as it relates to our compensation programs and policies. 
Based on this review, the Compensation Committee believes that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk but instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. The following features of our executive compensation program illustrate this point. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review by Independent Compensation Consultant. Our executive compensation programs have been designed and  reviewed by an independent compensation consultant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee Oversight. Our executive compensation programs are regularly reviewed and overseen  by an independent Compensation Committee that retains the discretion to reduce compensation based on corporate and individual performance and other factors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mix of Incentives. Our compensation programs provide an appropriate mix of short-term and long-term  incentives, as well as cash and equity opportunities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mix of Performance Metrics. The performance metrics associated with our incentive programs incorporate a  variety of drivers of the business over both annual and three-year time horizons.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong Link to Stockholder Interests. Equity components and long-term performance metrics create a strong  alignment between our executives' interests and our stockholders' interests. Because long-term incentives typically vest over a three-year period, our executives will always have unvested awards that could decrease in value if our business  is not well-managed for the long term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alignment with Annual Budget and Long-Term Strategic Plan. Performance metrics in our short- and long-term  incentive programs are aligned with both our annual budget and our long-term strategic plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appropriate Policies. We have adopted a "clawback" policy, a stock ownership and retention  policy, and prohibitions against hedging and pledging, thereby creating additional protections for our company and encouraging an alignment of our executives' and stockholders' interests.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Field Incentive Plan. Our operations field incentive plan is focused on growth, control, and  profit—the three primary drivers of success in our branches. This creates appropriate alignment of employee incentive opportunities with company goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Administration and Disclosure. Administrative procedures, communication, and disclosure processes closely  align with "best practices."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Securities Trading Policy. Officers must obtain permission from the General Counsel before the purchase or  sale of any shares, even during an open trading period.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the factors above, we believe that our NEOs and other employees are encouraged to manage our company in a prudent manner and that our incentive programs are not designed to encourage our NEOs or other employees to take excessive risks or risks that are inconsistent with the Company's and our stockholders' best interests. In addition, we have in place various controls and management processes that help mitigate the potential for incentive compensation plans to materially and adversely affect the Company.

We chose December 31, 2018, which is within the last three  months of our fiscal year as required by applicable SEC regulations, because it aligned with our calendar year payroll procedures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  We next identified the employee receiving the median amount of compensation in our employee population. To do  this, we compared the amount of wages and other compensation received by each employee, other than Mr. Knitzer, as reflected in our payroll records and reported to the Internal Revenue Service in Box 5 of Form  W-2 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018. This compensation measure was annualized for permanent employees who were employed on the measurement date but who did not work for the full calendar  year. The compensation measure was consistently applied to all of our employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Once we identified our median employee, we measured that employee's annual total compensation for the 2018  fiscal year by adding together (a) the same elements of compensation that are included in Mr. Knitzer's total fiscal 2018 compensation, as reported in our Summary Compensation Table above, and  (b) non-discriminatory health and welfare benefits paid by Regional, which we have included as "All Other Compensation" in the table above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  For Mr. Knitzer, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our Summary Compensation  Table above. Mr. Knitzer was eligible for but did not elect to participate in non-discretionary health and welfare benefits offered by Regional.  
[END TABLE]
The resulting pay ratio was calculated in a manner consistent with SEC regulations, and we believe that it constitutes a reasonable estimate. However, as contemplated by SEC regulations, we relied on methods and assumptions that we determined to be appropriate for calculating the Chief Executive Officer pay ratio at Regional. Other public companies will use methods and assumptions that differ from the ones we chose but are appropriate for their circumstances. It may therefore be difficult, for this and other reasons, to compare our reported pay ratio to pay ratios reported by other companies, including companies in our industry.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brian J. Fisher, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
Each of these individuals served as executive officers at the beginning of 2018. Mr. Taggart assumed the title of Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Risk Officer on October 24, 2018. 
We entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Knitzer and Schachtel shortly before each commenced employment with us in August 2016 and May 2017, respectively. Similarly, we entered into employment letter agreements with Messrs. Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher shortly before each commenced employment with us in January 2013, January 2015, and January 2013, respectively. In August 2017, we entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher that superseded each executive's prior employment letter agreement. In addition, we amended the employment agreements of Messrs. Knitzer and Schachtel in August 2017. In February 2019, we entered into a retirement agreement with Mr. Thomas that amended his employment agreement. 
We describe below the material terms of our executives' current employment agreements that were in effect for the entirety of 2018, as well as Mr. Thomas' retirement letter agreement. Additional information regarding the compensation that our executive officers are eligible for, earned, and were paid is set forth elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the Executive Compensation Tables set forth above. 
Employment Agreements with Executive Officers 
The employment agreements of Messrs. Knitzer, Schachtel, Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher provide for a three-year term. The three-year term ends on August 1, 2019 and May 30, 2020 in the case of Messrs. Knitzer and Schachtel, respectively, and on August 30, 2020 in the case of Messrs. Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher. The employment agreements generally provide for compensation to our executives in the form of annual base salaries, annual cash incentive opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities, and various other limited perquisites and personal benefits. Our executives have also agreed to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the employment agreements, including a covenant not to compete. 
Pursuant to their employment agreements, Messrs. Knitzer, Schachtel, Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher are entitled to an annual base salary of no less than $530,000; $350,000; $342,000; $318,000; and $240,000, respectively, pro-rated for any partial year. For each calendar year during the employment term, each executive is also eligible to earn an annual bonus award under our Annual Incentive Plan based upon the achievement of performance targets established by our Compensation Committee, with a target bonus equal to no less than 100% of the executive's base salary (pro-rated for any partial year). The employment agreements of Messrs. Knitzer and Schachtel provide that each such executive is entitled to receive a non-qualified stock option award, a performance-contingent RSU award, and a cash-settled performance unit award within his first year of employment, with the vesting of each such award subject to continued employment through the vesting date and, in the case of the performance-contingent RSU award and the cash-settled performance unit award, the achievement of performance objectives established by our Compensation Committee. Each executive is otherwise eligible to participate in our long-term incentive program at the sole discretion of our Compensation Committee and our Board. 
Commencing in 2018 (or 2019, in the case of Mr. Schachtel), Messrs. Knitzer, Schachtel, Thomas, Taggart, and Fisher will be eligible to receive an annual base salary, annual cash incentive opportunity, and long-term incentive opportunity totaling in the aggregate at least $3,000,000; $1,225,000; $1,197,000; $954,000; and $720,000, respectively. Each executive's annual total compensation opportunity is subject to our Compensation Committee's discretion to adjust base salary, determine allocations between cash and equity compensation opportunities, establish performance and/or multi-year service criteria, and determine if and to the extent any incentive compensation is earned and payable based on the attainment of performance criteria and other terms and conditions established by our Compensation Committee, and further subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable incentive plan and related award agreements (including, if applicable under any such plan or award agreement, multi-year vesting). Long-term incentive awards are subject to the terms of the 2015 Plan and the related award agreements. 
We also provide our executives with benefits generally available to our other employees, including medical and retirement plans. In addition, we provide our executives with the use of a mobile phone (or the provision of a stipend for a mobile phone), disability insurance policies, and reasonable travel expenses. In the case of Messrs. Knitzer and Schachtel, we pay for reasonable expenses associated with their travel to and from their personal residences to our headquarters in South Carolina. In the case of Mr. Thomas, we provide a car allowance of $1,150 per month. 
Our executive employment agreements and long-term incentive award agreements also provide for certain severance benefits following an executive's termination by us without cause, by the executive as a result of good reason, due to the executive's disability, due to the executive's death, or following a "double-trigger" change-in-control event. A "double trigger" change-in-control event requires both (1) a change-in-control and (2) an executive's termination by us without cause or by the executive as a result of good reason within certain timeframes. The terms "cause," "good reason," "disability," and "change-in-control" are defined in the 2011 Plan, the 2015 Plan, and/or each executive's employment agreement and/or long-term incentive award agreements, as applicable. The severance benefits are described in "Summary of Employment Arrangements with Executive Officers – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control," below. An executive's receipt of severance benefits will be subject to the executive's execution of a release of claims within the time period specified in the employment agreement and the continued compliance with the restrictive covenants described below. 
Each executive is also subject to various restrictive covenants, and his entitlement to certain benefits is contingent upon his compliance with such covenants. Specifically, each executive is subject to a covenant not to disclose our confidential information during his employment and at all times thereafter, a covenant not to compete during his employment and for a period of one year (or two years, in the case of Mr. Knitzer) following his termination of employment, a covenant not to solicit competitive "business services" through or from "loan sources" (each as defined in the employment agreements) during his employment and for a period of one year (or two years, in the case of Mr. Knitzer) following his termination of employment, a covenant not to solicit or hire our employees during his employment and for a period of one year (or two years, in the case of Mr. Knitzer) following his termination of employment, and a non-disparagement covenant effective during the employment term and at all times thereafter. Each executive's covenant not to compete is limited to an area within 25 miles of any of our branches or other offices. 
In addition, each executive must abide by any equity retention policy, compensation recovery policy, stock ownership guidelines, or other similar policies that we maintain. 
Retirement Agreement with Chief Financial Officer 
On February 12, 2019, Mr. Thomas notified the Company of his intent to retire from the Company following the completion of an orderly transition of duties and responsibilities from Mr. Thomas to a new Chief Financial Officer to be identified by the Company. Mr. Thomas' retirement will be treated as a voluntary termination of employment pursuant to the terms of Mr. Thomas' employment agreement (described in detail above). The date of the completion of the Chief Financial Officer transition will be determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee approved a letter agreement (the "Retirement Agreement"), dated February 12, 2019, setting forth the terms of Mr. Thomas' retirement. Pursuant to the Retirement Agreement, Mr. Thomas' employment agreement was amended, among other items, to provide that the compensation terms found in the Retirement Agreement generally supersede those found in his employment agreement. The Retirement Agreement provides that Mr. Thomas will continue to serve as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer until his termination date, which will follow an orderly transition of duties and responsibilities from Mr. Thomas to a new Chief Financial Officer; however, the Company may modify his title, duties, and/or responsibilities to facilitate the hiring of and transition to a new Chief Financial Officer. 
During the transition period, Mr. Thomas will be paid an annualized base salary of $400,000 (pro-rated for any partial year), which is subject to increase (but not decrease) by the Company. He will also generally continue to participate in those Company benefit plans and arrangements in which he is currently eligible to participate. Mr. 
 Thomas is eligible to receive a pro-rated annual cash incentive bonus for 2019 if and to the extent that the applicable performance goals are met and the 2019 annual cash incentive bonus is deemed earned in accordance with the terms of the Company's Annual Incentive Plan and as determined by the Compensation Committee. He also will remain eligible to receive an annual bonus for 2018 under the Annual Incentive Plan if and to the extent earned, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Thomas is also eligible to earn a completion bonus of $200,000 following the completion of an orderly transition of duties and responsibilities to a new Chief Financial Officer. No completion bonus will be paid if Mr. Thomas voluntarily terminates his employment prior to the completion date, as determined by the Compensation Committee, or if the Company terminates his employment for cause. If the Company terminates Mr. Thomas' employment without cause, the completion bonus will be considered earned as of his termination date. Mr. Thomas' outstanding long-term incentive awards granted under the 2011 Plan and the 2015 Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of the applicable stock plan and related award agreement(s). Mr. Thomas is also eligible to receive certain severance benefits provided under his employment agreement to the extent his employment is terminated by the Company without cause, by him for good reason, or due to disability prior to March 31, 2019. Mr. Thomas will not be entitled to severance benefits upon a termination for any other reason or for any termination occurring after March 31, 2019. 
As a condition to receipt of the $200,000 completion bonus and the 2019 annual cash incentive bonus, Mr. Thomas has agreed to execute a general waiver and release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Thomas also remains subject to the restrictive covenants described in his employment agreement, including covenants concerning confidentiality, non-disparagement, and, for one year following his termination of employment, non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
Under their employment agreements and long-term incentive award agreements, our executive officers are entitled to certain severance benefits following termination by us without cause, by the executive as a result of good reason, due to the executive's disability, due to the executive's death, and following a "double-trigger" change-in-control. These benefits ensure that our executives are motivated primarily by the needs of our business, rather than circumstances that are outside of the ordinary course of business (such as circumstances that might lead to the termination of an executive's employment or that might lead to a change-in-control). Severance benefits provide for a level of continued compensation if an executive's employment is adversely affected in these circumstances, subject to certain conditions. We believe that these benefits enable executives to focus fully on their duties while employed by us, ensure that our executives act in the best interests of our stockholders, even if such actions are otherwise contrary to our executives' personal interests, and alleviate concerns that may arise in the event of an executive's separation from service with us. We believe that these severance benefits are in line with current market practices. 
The rights to and level of benefits are determined by the type of termination event. Our executive employment agreements provide for the following cash and other benefits:

[END TABLE]
The following table provides information concerning the payments and the value of other benefits that our NEOs would have been eligible to receive if their employment had been terminated under the described circumstances. Our obligation to provide the payments and other benefits described in the table are found in each NEO's employment agreement and in long-term incentive award agreements, in each case as described above. 
In calculating the amounts included in the table, we have assumed (i) that the termination event and/or change-in-control occurred on December 31, 2018, (ii) a share price of $24.05 (our closing share price on December 31, 2018), and (iii) the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Payment in Lieu of 30 Days' Notice": We have assumed that we will elect to pay 30 days' base  salary in lieu of allowing the NEO to work through any required 30-day termination notice period.  
• "Severance Payment": The amount represents a combination of the "Base Salary Continuation"  and "Average Bonus" payments described above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Annual Incentive Compensation": The amount is based upon the level of performance and percentage  payout actually achieved, as determined by the Compensation Committee in February 2019.  
• "Long-Term Incentive Award Vesting": The value associated with accelerated non-qualified stock option awards has been calculated by multiplying the number of accelerated shares by the amount by which our stock price as of December 31, 2018 exceeded (if at all) the exercise price of  the option. For any performance-contingent long-term incentive award where vesting remains subject to actual performance over a performance period, (1) we have calculated the value (if any) of awards associated with performance periods ending  in 2018 based on actual performance, and (2) we have ascribed no value to awards associated with performance periods ending after 2018 because there is no guarantee that we will meet the threshold performance criteria required for these awards  to vest and be paid.  
• "Other Benefits": The amount includes reimbursement of COBRA premiums for continuation coverage and the  value of outplacement services. We have assumed (1) that the NEO will not become entitled to obtain insurance from a subsequent employer, and (2) that the NEO will receive the maximum value of outplacement services.

[END TABLE]
The amounts shown in the table do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided generally to all salaried employees upon termination of employment and do not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of our NEOs. Because the amounts in the table are calculated subject to the assumptions provided and on the basis of the occurrence of a termination as of a particular date and under a particular set of circumstances, the actual amount to be paid to each of our NEOs upon a termination or change in control may vary significantly from the amounts included in the table. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of the termination event and the type of termination event that occurs. 
SUMMARY OF COMPANY INCENTIVE PLANS 
The discussion that follows describes certain material terms of our principal long-term incentive plans and our principal cash incentive plan. 
Long-Term Incentive Plans 
2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The 2015 Plan became effective April 22, 2015, and was amended and restated effective April 27, 2017. The purposes of the 2015 Plan are (i) to encourage and enable selected employees, directors, and consultants to acquire or increase their holdings of our common stock and other equity-based interests and/or to provide other incentive awards in order to promote a closer identification of their interests with our interests and those of our stockholders, and (ii) to provide us with flexibility to motivate, attract, and retain the services of participants upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of our operation largely depends. Awards granted under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs (including related or freestanding SARs), RSAs, RSU awards, performance share awards, performance unit awards, phantom stock awards, other stock-based awards, and/or dividend equivalent awards. Awards may be granted under the 2015 Plan until April 21, 2025 or the plan's earlier termination by the Board. 
The 2015 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, subject to Board oversight. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that we may issue pursuant to awards granted under the 2015 Plan may not exceed the sum of (i) 1,550,000 shares, plus (ii) any shares (A) remaining available for grant as of the effective date of the 2015 Plan under any prior plan and/or (B) subject to an award granted under a prior plan, which award is forfeited, canceled, terminated, expires, or lapses for any reason without the issuance of shares or pursuant to which such shares are forfeited. In addition, shares subject to certain awards will again be available for issuance (or otherwise not counted against the maximum number of available shares) under the 2015 Plan, including unissued or forfeited shares subject to awards that are canceled, terminate, expire, are forfeited, or lapse for any reason; awards settled in cash; dividends (including dividends paid in shares) or dividend equivalents paid in cash in connection with outstanding awards; and shares subject to an award other than an option or SAR that are not issued for any reason (including failure to achieve maximum performance criteria). Further, the following will not reduce the maximum number of shares available under the 2015 Plan: (i) shares issued under the 2015 Plan through the settlement, assumption, or substitution of outstanding awards granted by another entity or obligations to grant future awards in connection with a merger or similar transaction that involves our acquisition of another entity, and (ii) available shares under a shareholder approved plan of an acquired company (as adjusted to reflect the transaction) that are used for awards under the 2015 Plan, in each case, subject to NYSE listing requirements. 
The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan pursuant to the grant of incentive options may not exceed 1,550,000 shares. Further, under the 2015 Plan, in any 12-month period, (i) no participant may be granted options and SARs that are not related to an option for more than 450,000 shares of common stock (or the equivalent value thereof based on the fair market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant of an award); (ii) no participant may be granted awards other than options or SARs that are settled in shares of common stock for more than 450,000 shares of common stock; and (iii) the maximum amount of awards that are settled in cash that can be granted to any one participant is $2,500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to awards granted during any 12-month period to a non-employee director, taken together with any cash fees paid during such 12-month period to such non-employee director in respect of Board service, may not exceed $600,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such awards based on the fair market value per share of common stock on the grant date of such award). 
The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan, the participant award limitations, and the terms of awards may be adjusted in the event of an adjustment in our capital structure (due to a merger, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, or similar event). 
2011 Stock Incentive Plan 
The 2011 Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 950,000 shares of common stock pursuant to awards granted under the plan. Awards may include incentive or non-qualified stock options, SARs (including related or freestanding SARs), other stock-based awards (including shares of common stock, restricted shares, RSUs, and awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, the fair market value of our common stock), and/or performance-based awards to our and our subsidiaries' key employees, directors, or other service providers. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan and the terms of awards may be adjusted upon certain events affecting our capitalization. The 2011 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee and was replaced by the 2015 Plan. Awards may no longer be granted under the 2011 Plan, and any shares that remained available for grant have been rolled over to the 2015 Plan. However, awards that remain outstanding under the 2011 Plan will continue in accordance with their respective terms. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
The Annual Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee and provides for the payment of incentive bonuses based on the attainment of performance objectives in the form of cash or, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in awards of shares under the 2015 Plan. The purpose of the Annual Incentive Plan is to enable us to attract, retain, motivate, and reward selected officers and other employees by providing them with the opportunity to earn annual incentive compensation awards based on the attainment of certain performance objectives. The Compensation Committee will establish the performance periods over which performance objectives will be measured. A performance period may be for a fiscal year or a shorter period, as determined by the Compensation Committee, and performance periods may overlap. For a given performance period, the Compensation Committee will establish (i) the performance objective or objectives that must be achieved for a participant to be eligible to receive a bonus for such performance period, and (ii) the target incentive bonus for each participant. The Compensation Committee may adjust awards as appropriate for partial achievement of goals or other factors, and may interpret and make necessary and appropriate adjustments to performance goals and the manner in which goals are evaluated.The Compensation Committee has absolute discretion to reduce or eliminate the amount of an award granted to a participant, including an award otherwise earned and payable under the Annual Incentive Plan, and to establish rules or procedures that have the effect of limiting the amount payable to each participant to an amount that is less than the maximum amount otherwise authorized as that participant's target incentive bonus. No participant may receive a bonus under the Annual Incentive Plan, with respect to any fiscal year, in excess of $2,500,000. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
We are seeking stockholder action on the following three proposals, which are described in greater detail below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  The election of the eight nominees named in this Proxy Statement to serve as members of the Board until the  next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  The ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  The approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors 
Our Bylaws currently provide that the number of directors of the Company shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board. There are presently eight directors. 
The Nominating Committee evaluates the size and composition of the Board on at least an annual basis. In connection therewith, the Nominating Committee has nominated and recommends for election as directors the following eight nominees: Jonathan D. Brown, Roel C. Campos, Maria Contreras-Sweet, Michael R. Dunn, Steven J. Freiberg, Peter R. Knitzer, Alvaro G. de Molina, and Carlos Palomares. Each nominee presently serves as a director. Directors shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation, removal, or death. 
A candidate for election as a director is nominated to stand for election based on his or her professional experience, recognized achievements in his or her respective fields, an ability to contribute to some aspect of our business, and the willingness to make the commitment of time and effort required of a director. A description of the background, business experience, skills, qualifications, attributes, and certain other information with respect to each of the nominees for election to the Board can be found above in the "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Matters" section of this Proxy Statement. Each of the above-listed nominees has been identified as possessing an appropriate diversity of background and experience, good judgment, deep knowledge of our industry, strength of character, and an independent mind, as well as a reputation for integrity and high personal and professional ethics. Each nominee also brings a strong and unique background and set of skills to the Board, giving the Board, as a whole, competence and experience in a wide variety of areas. 
In selecting this slate of nominees for 2019, the Nominating Committee specifically considered the background and business experience of each of the nominees, along with the familiarity of the nominees with our business and prospects, which has been developed as a result of their service on our Board. The Nominating Committee believes that such familiarity will be helpful in addressing the opportunities and challenges that we face in the current business environment. 
Each of the eight nominees has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serve as a director, if elected. In the event that any nominee withdraws, or for any reason is unable to serve as a director, the proxies will be voted for such other person as may be designated by the Nominating Committee as a substitute nominee, but in no event will proxies be voted for more than eight nominees. The Nominating Committee has no reason to believe that any nominee will not continue to be a candidate or will not serve if elected. 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each of the nominees listed above. 
Proposal No. 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
RSM US LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2007. The Audit Committee has selected RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and the Audit Committee and the Board recommend that the stockholders ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. 
A representative of RSM US LLP plans to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. Although ratification is not required, the Board is submitting the appointment of RSM US LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. In the event that the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider whether to appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to us by our independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees     $  856,843           $  702,990        
 Audit-Related Fees        8,400              —        
 Tax Fees        170,114              202,101        
 All Other Fees        —              —        
 Total     $              1,035,357           $                  905,091          
[END TABLE]
In the above table, in accordance with applicable SEC rules: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Audit Fees" are fees billed for professional services rendered by the independent registered public  accounting firm for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, review of consolidated financial statements included in our Forms 10-Q, and services that are normally provided by the independent  registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Audit-Related Fees" are fees billed for assurance and related services performed by the independent  registered public accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements that are not reported above under "Audit Fees." In 2018, these fees were for services performed by the  independent registered public accounting firm for accounting consultation services. There were no such fees incurred in 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Tax Fees" are fees billed for professional services rendered by the independent registered public  accounting firm for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. In 2018, these fees were for services performed for the filing of our 2017 tax returns and estimated payments for 2018. In 2017, these fees were for services performed for the filing  of our 2016 tax returns and estimated payments for 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "All Other Fees" represent fees billed for ancillary professional services that are not reported above  under "Audit Fees," "Audit Related Fees," or "Tax Fees." There were no such fees incurred in 2018 or 2017.  
[END TABLE]
It is the policy of the Audit Committee to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services proposed to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviewed and pre-approved all of the services performed by RSM US LLP. The process for such pre-approval is typically as follows: Audit Committee pre-approval is sought at one of the Audit Committee's regularly scheduled meetings following the presentation of information at such meeting detailing the particular services proposed to be performed. The authority to pre-approve non-audit services may be delegated by the Audit Committee to the Chair of the Audit Committee, who shall present any decision to pre-approve an activity to the full Audit Committee at the first regular meeting following such decision. None of the services described above were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the exception provided by Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) under Regulation S-X. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by RSM US LLP and has determined that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining RSM US LLP's independence. 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
Proposal No. 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, our stockholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables in this Proxy Statement (a "Say-on-Pay Vote"). Taking into consideration the most recent voting results from our 2018 annual stockholders' meeting concerning the frequency of the Say-on-Pay Vote, we determined that we will hold an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. 
The Compensation Committee oversees the development of a compensation program designed to attract, retain, and motivate executives who enable us to achieve our strategic and financial goals. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosure illustrate the trends in compensation and the application of our compensation philosophies and practices for the years presented. We encourage stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program achieves an appropriate balance between fixed compensation and variable incentive compensation, pays for performance, and promotes an alignment between the interests of our named executive officers and our stockholders. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote at the Annual Meeting "FOR" the non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers, including as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative discussion. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon us, the Compensation Committee, or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions of our stockholders and will take the outcome of the vote into account when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on our Investor Relations website, www.regionalmanagement.com. This report reviews the actions taken by the Audit Committee with regard to our financial reporting process during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and particularly with regard to the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
The Audit Committee is composed solely of independent directors under existing NYSE listing standards and SEC requirements. None of the committee members is or has been an officer or employee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries or has engaged in any business transaction or has any business or family relationship with the Company or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Steven J. Freiberg, Alvaro G. de Molina, and Carlos Palomares are "audit committee financial experts," as defined by SEC rules. 
Our management has the primary responsibility for our financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and to select annually the accountants to serve as our independent auditors for the coming year. The Audit Committee has implemented procedures to ensure that during the course of each fiscal year it devotes the attention that it deems necessary or appropriate to fulfill its oversight responsibilities under the Audit Committee's charter. To carry out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of the quality, rather than just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee also discussed our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, their judgments as to the quality, rather than just the acceptability, of our accounting principles, and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under the applicable PCAOB Standards and SEC Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the auditors their independence from management and the Company, including the matters in the written disclosures and the letter required by the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence. The Audit Committee also considered whether the provision of services during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, by the auditors that were unrelated to their audit of the consolidated financial statements referred to above and to their reviews of our interim consolidated financial statements during the fiscal year is compatible with maintaining their independence. 
Additionally, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the overall scope and plan for their audit. The Audit Committee met with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of our internal controls, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. This report of the Audit Committee has been prepared by members of the Audit Committee.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and our other equity securities. Our directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were timely complied with by such persons. 
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
Cooperation Agreement 
On January 26, 2018, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with Basswood, pursuant to which we appointed Jonathan D. Brown to the Board, effective January 26, 2018. 
Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, Mr. Brown is required to, at all times while serving as a member of the Board, comply with all policies, procedures, processes, codes, rules, standards, and guidelines applicable to non-employee Board members. In addition, the Cooperation Agreement provides that Mr. Brown must offer to resign from the Board if (i) Basswood and its affiliates, collectively, no longer beneficially own an aggregate "net long position" of at least 874,705 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar adjustments), or (ii) Basswood fails to comply with or breaches any of the terms of the Cooperation Agreement in any material respect and, if capable of being cured, such material breach or failure has not been cured within 15 days after receipt by Basswood of written notice from us specifying such material breach or failure, provided that we are not in material breach of the Cooperation Agreement at such time. The Cooperation Agreement also provides that, if requested by Basswood, we are obligated to appoint Mr. Brown to any existing or newly created committee of the Board that may be designated to oversee or review strategic alternatives (including an extraordinary transaction). 
In the Cooperation Agreement, in addition to certain confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions, Basswood has agreed to various customary standstill provisions for the duration of the Standstill Period (as defined below), which provide, among other things, that Basswood and its affiliates will not (i) acquire beneficial ownership of 19.9% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (ii) participate in a proxy solicitation with respect to the voting of any shares of our common stock; (iii) submit a proposal for or offer of any extraordinary transaction or propose a change in the structure, size, or composition of the Board or executive officers of the Company; or (iv) subject to certain exceptions for open market and underwritten transactions, sell shares of our common stock to a third party or group that to Basswood's knowledge would result in such third party or group owning 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
Basswood has also agreed that, during the Standstill Period, it shall cause the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by it and its affiliates to be voted (i) in favor of each director nominated by the Board for election, and (ii) in accordance with the Board's recommendations on all other matters; provided that Basswood and its affiliates may vote their shares of our common stock in their sole discretion with respect to (a) a proposal to authorize or approve an extraordinary transaction, (b) matters related to the implementation of takeover defenses, (c) new or amended incentive compensation plans submitted for stockholder approval, or (d) any other proposal if either Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. or Glass Lewis & Co., LLC do not recommend voting in accordance with the Board's recommendation with respect to such proposal (other than with respect to the election or removal of directors) at any annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, the "Standstill Period" was initially defined to mean the period commencing on January 26, 2018 and ending on the earliest of (i) 12:01 a.m. (New York time) on the date that is 20 days prior to the nomination deadline for the 2019 Annual Meeting, (ii) if we fail to comply with or breach any of the terms of the Cooperation Agreement in any material respect and, if capable of being cured, such material breach or failure has not been cured within 15 days after receipt by us of written notice from Basswood specifying such material breach or failure, provided that Basswood is not in material breach of the Cooperation Agreement at such time, (iii) the consummation of an extraordinary transaction following which consummation the director designated by Basswood no longer serves on the Board, and (iv) a reorganization of the Company under any federal or state law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. However, as permitted by the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, we provided timely written notice to Basswood that we would nominate a director designated by Basswood for election to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting, which extended the Standstill Period until the date that is 20 days prior to the nomination deadline for the 2020 Annual Meeting. If we provide written notice to Basswood that we will nominate a director designated by Basswood for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting or for any annual meeting of stockholders of the Company subsequent thereto (each, an "Applicable Meeting") at least 20 days prior to the nomination deadline for such Applicable Meeting and Basswood has agreed in advance to such nomination, then the Standstill Period will be automatically extended further until the date that is 20 days prior to the nomination deadline for the annual stockholders meeting subsequent to such Applicable Meeting. 
The Cooperation Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the Standstill Period (subject to any extensions as provided in the Cooperation Agreement), provided that the confidentiality provisions of the Cooperation Agreement will survive for a period of 18 months following the date upon which no director designated by Basswood serves as a director of the Company. 
Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Board has adopted a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our "related person policy." Our related person policy requires that a "related person" (as defined in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose to our general counsel, or other person designated by our Board, any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is anticipated and would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, which includes transactions in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The general counsel, or such other person, will then promptly communicate that information to our Board. No related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our Board or a committee of the Board. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote of a related person transaction in which they have an interest and provide all material information he or she has concerning the related person transaction to the Board. Our policy does not specify the standards to be applied by directors in determining whether or not to approve or ratify a related person transaction, and we accordingly anticipate that these determinations will be made in accordance with principles of Delaware law generally applicable to directors of a Delaware corporation. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Board may consider such facts and circumstances as it deems appropriate, including (1) the benefits to us; (2) the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; (3) the terms of the proposed related person transaction; and (4) the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally in an arms-length negotiation. 
Indemnification of Directors, Officers, and Certain Current and Former Stockholders 
Our Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). In addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our directors will not be liable for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Further, in connection with the September 2013 and December 2013 secondary public offerings described above, we agreed to indemnify Palladium, Parallel, and certain other selling stockholders for certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of such secondary public offerings. 
There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers to which indemnification is being sought, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director, officer, or other party. 
Proposals by Stockholders 
Under certain conditions, stockholders may request that we include a proposal at a forthcoming meeting of our stockholders in our proxy materials for such meeting. Under SEC Rule 14a-8, any stockholder desiring to present such a proposal to be acted upon at the 2020 Annual Meeting and included in the proxy materials for such meeting must ensure that we receive the proposal at our principal executive office in Greer, South Carolina by November 28, 2019, in order for the proposal to be eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement and proxy card relating to such meeting. 
If a stockholder desires to propose any business at an annual meeting of stockholders, even if the proposal or proposed director candidate is not to be included in our proxy statement, our Bylaws provide that the stockholder must deliver or mail timely advance written notice of such business to our principal executive office. Under our Bylaws, to be timely, a stockholder's notice generally must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than the 90th day before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting and not earlier than the 120th day prior to such anniversary. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days or delayed by more than 70 days from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Each item of business must be made in accordance with, and must include the information required by, our Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation. Assuming that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is not advanced or delayed in the manner described above, the required notice for the 2020 Annual Meeting would need to be provided to us not earlier than December 27, 2019 and not later than January 26, 2020. 
If, following the filing and delivery of these proxy materials, the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 20 calendar days from the one-year anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, we will, in a timely manner, provide notice to our stockholders of the new date of the 2020 Annual Meeting and the new dates by which stockholder proposals submitted both pursuant to and outside of SEC Rule 14a-8 must be received by us. Such notice will be included in the earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under Part II, Item 5. 
Householding of Annual Meeting Materials 
Some banks, brokers, and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" annual reports and proxy statements. This means that only one copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement, as applicable, may have been sent to multiple stockholders in the same household. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement, as applicable, to any stockholder upon request submitted in writing to us at the following address: Regional Management Corp., 979 Batesville Road, Suite B, Greer, South Carolina, 29651, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or by calling (864) 448-7000. Any stockholder who wants to receive separate copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement in the future, or who is currently receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for his or her household, should contact his or her bank, broker, or other nominee record holder, or contact us at the above address and telephone number. 
Other Business 
The Board is not aware of any matters, other than those specified above, to come before the Annual Meeting for action by the stockholders. However, if any matter requiring a vote of the stockholders should be duly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting, then the persons named in the form of proxy intend to vote such proxy in accordance with their best judgment.
