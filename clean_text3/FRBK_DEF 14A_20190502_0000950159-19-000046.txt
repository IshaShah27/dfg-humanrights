[END TABLE]
If you vote electronically via the Internet or by telephone, you will need your shareholder control number (your           shareholder control number can be found on your proxy card).
If you hold your shares in street name or through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, see "How do I vote if shares           are held in street name or through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee?" for instruction on how to vote your shares.
How do I vote if shares are held in street name or through               a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee?
If you hold your shares in street name or through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you will need to vote your           shares by providing voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, in accordance with the voting instruction form provided to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, or by obtaining a legal proxy from your bank,           brokerage firm or other nominee authorizing you to vote those shares at the annual meeting.  Only with a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee can you cast your vote in person at the annual meeting.
How will my proxy be voted?
If you are a record shareholder and you submit a signed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or the internet but           do not indicate how you want your shares voted, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote your shares of common stock:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of each of the board's director                        nominees named in this proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the                        compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the advisory vote on executive compensation to                        occur every two years; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA,                        LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the annual meeting or any postponement or adjournment           thereof, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote your shares of common stock in their discretion in accordance with their best judgment and in the manner they believe to be in the best interest of the Company.
-2-
If you hold your shares of the Company's common stock in "street name" (that is, through a broker or other nominee) and           fail to instruct your broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares of common stock the broker or other nominee may generally vote on "routine" matters, but cannot vote on "non-routine" matters under the rules of various national and regional           securities exchanges. If the broker or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will not be able to vote your shares on           such matter, which is often referred to as a "broker non-vote." The election of directors, the advisory vote on named executive officer compensation, and the advisory vote on the frequency of say-on pay votes are considered non-routine matters           under applicable regulatory rules. The ratification of BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year is considered routine under applicable regulatory rules.   Therefore, if you hold your shares in           "street name" and fail to instruct your broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares of common stock on the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December           31, 2019, your broker or other nominee has discretionary voting authority to vote your shares on such proposal.
Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote after submitting my               proxy?
Proxies may be revoked at any time prior to being voted at the annual meeting.  You may revoke a proxy before its           exercise by filing written notice of revocation with our Secretary before the annual meeting.  After voting, you may change your vote one or more times by completing and returning a new proxy to our Secretary, by voting again by internet or           telephone as described in this proxy statement, or by voting in person at the annual meeting.  You may request a new proxy card from our Secretary.  The last vote received chronologically will supersede any prior votes.  The deadline for           registered shareholders to change their vote by internet or telephone is 11:59 PM, EDT, on May 1, 2019.  All requests and correspondence with our Secretary should be mailed to Republic First Bancorp, Inc., Two Liberty Place, 50 South 16th           Street, Suite 2400, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, Attention:  Kemma Brown, Corporate Secretary.
What constitutes a quorum at the annual meeting?
We need a quorum of shareholders to hold a valid annual meeting.  A quorum will be present if at least a majority of the           outstanding shares of common stock are represented in person or by proxy at the annual meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum.  If the annual meeting is adjourned because of the           absence of a quorum, those shareholders entitled to vote who attend the adjourned annual meeting, although constituting less than a quorum as provided herein, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors.  If the           annual meeting is adjourned for one or more periods aggregating at least 15 days due to the absence of a quorum, shareholders who are entitled to vote and who attend the adjourned annual meeting, even though they do not constitute a quorum as           described above at the adjourned meeting, will constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting on any matter described in the Notice of annual meeting.
How can I obtain directions to attend the annual meeting               and vote in person?
The annual meeting will be held at The Westin Philadelphia which is located at 99 South 17th Street at           Liberty Place, Philadelphia, PA 19103.  You may obtain directions to The Westin Philadelphia by contacting their office during regular business hours at (215) 563-1600 or by accessing The Westin Philadelphia's website at           https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/phlwi-the-westin-philadelphia/ and clicking on the "Map" tab.  The information on this website is not incorporated into this proxy statement and is an inactive textual reference only.

How many votes are required for the election of directors               (Proposal 1)?
For Proposal 1, directors are elected by a plurality vote of shares of common stock cast in person or by proxy at the           annual meeting, provided a quorum is present.  A "plurality" means that the individuals who receive the largest number of affirmative votes cast are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the annual meeting.            Votes that are withheld from a director nominee will be excluded entirely from the vote for such nominee and will have no effect on the result.  Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. Shareholders are not entitled to           cumulative voting in the election of directors.
How many votes are required for the advisory vote to               approve named executive officer compensation (Proposal 2)?
We are required to submit a proposal to shareholders for a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our           named executive officers pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act.  Proposal 2 will be approved if a majority of the votes represented in person or proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote are voted FOR the proposal.  Abstentions will have the same legal effect as votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
How many votes are required for the advisory vote on the               frequency of say-on-pay votes (Proposal 3)?
The time period (every one, two or three years) receiving votes from a majority of the shares of common stock that are           present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote shall determine the frequency approved by shareholders on an advisory basis. Abstentions will have the same legal effect as votes against all other options. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. If one of the time           periods presented does not receive votes from a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, the board will treat the time period that receives the greatest number of votes as the time period           selected by the shareholders.           
How many votes are required for the ratification of the               appointment of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal 4)?
Proposal 4 will be approved if a majority of the votes represented in person or proxy at the annual meeting and entitled           to vote are voted FOR the proposal.  Abstentions will have the same legal effect as votes against the proposal. Brokers or other nominees will           have discretion to vote on Proposal 4.
-4-
How many votes are required for any other proposals that               may properly come before the annual meeting?
Generally, any other proposals that may properly come before the annual meeting or any postponement or adjournment           thereof will be approved if a majority of the votes at the annual meeting and entitled to vote thereon are voted in favor of the action, unless otherwise provided by express provision of law or by our articles of incorporation or our bylaws.            Abstentions, but not broker non-votes, will have the same legal effect as votes against any other proposal.  Broker non-votes will not count as votes against any proposal at the annual meeting.

PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Company's by-laws provide that the board may consist of not less than five directors and not more than twenty-five           directors, classified into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the specific number of directors fixed from time to time by resolution of the board.  The members of one class of directors are elected at each annual meeting           and each class of directors serves for approximately three years.  The classes of directors have been designated as "Class I," "Class II" and "Class III."
The board has currently fixed the number of directors at eight.  The Class I Directors are Harry D. Madonna and Brian P.           Tierney, Esq.; the Class II Directors are Lisa R. Jacobs, Esq., Harris Wildstein, Esq. and Andrew B. Cohen; and the Class III Directors are Vernon W. Hill, II, Barry L. Spevak and Theodore J. Flocco, Jr.  The incumbent Class I Directors will           continue in office until the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the incumbent Class II Directors will continue in office until the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  All directors will hold office until the annual           meeting of shareholders at which their terms expire and until the elections and qualifications of their successors.
Upon the recommendation of the nominating and governance committee of our board of directors, our board has nominated           Vernon W. Hill, II, Barry L. Spevak and Theodore J. Flocco, Jr. for re-election as Class III Directors to serve until the Company's 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and thereafter until their successors are elected and qualified.  All of the           director nominees have agreed to stand for election.  In the event, however, that, for any reason, one or more director nominees becomes unavailable for election or service as director, the board may designate a substitute nominee or nominees to           replace him or them and the persons designated in the enclosed proxy will vote for the election of such other person or persons as the board may recommend.
The specific backgrounds and qualifications of our current directors and director nominees are reflected in each           person's biography below.
Director Nominees
The following individuals have been nominated for election to the board as Class III Directors, to serve until the 2022           Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualified.
Vernon W. Hill II, age               73, has been a director and chairman of the Company since December 5, 2016. Mr. Hill was previously the chairman, chief executive officer, and president of Commerce Bancorp, Inc. which he founded in 1973. Under his direction, Commerce Bank grew           from one location in Marlton, N.J. to more than 450 branches along the east coast of the U.S. with over $50 billion in assets before its sale in 2007. He is often credited with reinventing the concept of American banking. His book titled "Fans Not Customers: How to Create Growth Companies in a No Growth World" is based on the concept that it is better to have fans rather than           customers and that businesses should compete on service instead of price. Mr. Hill is also the chairman and founder of Metro Bank in the U.K., Britain's first new High Street bank in over 100 years. Since opening its first branch in 2010, Metro           Bank has grown to 65 branches, more than $28 billion in assets, and over 1.6 million customer accounts in just eight years. Mr. Hill is also the chairman of Petplan, USA, the largest pet health insurer in the world. He also is a partner in a real           estate development firm which has developed numerous shopping centers and retail locations. Mr. Hill's experience in banking for over forty years provides the Company with leadership skills and knowledge required to successfully operate and grow           financial institutions. His experience in real estate and other businesses also offers the board valuable insight to execute its expansion strategy.

Theodore J. Flocco,             Jr., C.P.A., age 74, has been a director of the Company and the Bank since 2008.  Before his retirement from Ernst & Young LLP, Mr. Flocco was a general audit partner and advised many of the largest SEC regulated clients of the           Philadelphia office for more than 35 years, including several regional and local banks.  Mr. Flocco has experience in the banking, mutual fund, real estate and manufacturing and distribution industries.  His responsibilities at Ernst & Young           LLP included consulting with senior executives and directors of companies on accounting and strategic business issues, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings and SEC registrations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES
Director Independence
The Company's common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market and the Company's board of directors has determined the           independence of the members of its board and committees under the NASDAQ listing standards. The Company's board of directors determined that under NASDAQ independence standards Messrs. Cohen, Flocco, Spevak, Tierney, Wildstein and Ms. Jacobs,           constituting a majority of the members of the Company's board of directors, are independent, and that all of the members of the audit, nominating and governance and compensation committees are independent (as defined under the applicable SEC           rules and the listing standards of NASDAQ).  The Company's only directors who were determined to not be independent were Mr. Madonna and Mr. Hill.
The board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of chief executive officer and chairman of the           board as the board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to make that determination based on the position and direction of the Company and the membership of the board.  Accordingly, the board periodically reviews its leadership           structure. Prior to December 2016, the Company's president and chief executive officer also served as chairman of the board.  The board believed that this leadership structure was appropriate for the Company at the time, in that the combined role           of president and chairman of the board and chief executive officer promoted unified leadership and direction for the Company, allowing for a single, clear focus for management to execute the Company's strategy and business plan.  The board also           believed that the Company's chief executive officer was best situated to serve as chairman of the board because of his familiar knowledge of the Company's business and industry, and was most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities           and leading the discussion and execution of corporate strategy. Independent directors and management have different views and roles in the development of a strategic plan.  The Company's independent directors bring experience, oversight and           expertise from outside the Company and often the industry, while the chief executive officer brings Company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise. In December 2016, the board elected Vernon W. Hill, II as a director and           appointed Mr. Hill Chairman of the board of directors.  Given Mr. Hill's extensive background in the financial services industry and his status as a significant shareholder of the Company, the board believes that Mr. Hill's appointment as           Chairman and Mr. Madonna's continued role as President and Chief Executive Officer, offer many of the same benefits of the prior structure while also reflecting what many consider corporate governance best practices.
We have a relatively small board, a majority of which is independent under Nasdaq listing standards.  Each independent           director has direct access to our chairman of the board, as well as to our president and chief executive officer and other members of the senior management team. The independent directors are also given the option at every board meeting to meet           in executive session without management present.
The board oversees the Company's risk management, satisfying itself that our risk management practices are consistent           with our corporate strategy and are functioning appropriately.  While a degree of risk is inherent in any business activity, the board strives to ensure that risk management is incorporated into the Company's culture, and to foster risk-aware and           risk-adjusted decision-making throughout the organization.  We believe our risk management processes are set up to bring to the board's attention our material risks, and permit the board to understand and evaluate how those risks interrelate and           how management addresses them.
-10-
Our board performs its risk oversight function in several ways.  The board establishes standards for risk management by           approving policies that address and mitigate the Company's most material risks.  These include policies addressing credit risk, interest rate risk, capital risk, and liquidity risk, as well as Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering compliance.            The board also monitors, reviews, and reacts to our risks through various reports presented by management, internal and external auditors, and regulatory examiners.  The board conducts certain risk oversight activities through its various           committees which have direct oversight over specific functional areas.  Our asset/liability committee, or ALCO, is also comprised of directors and members of senior management, and has primary responsibility for risks associated with our exposure           to fluctuations in interest rates and our liquidity needs.  Our audit committee is responsible for risks associated with our financial reporting and internal controls, and our compensation committee is responsible for risks associated with our           compensation practices.  Notwithstanding that each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.
Meetings of the Board and Attendance
During 2018, the directors held six board meetings.  All of the current directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate           of (1) the total number of meetings of the board (held during the period for which such director was a member of the board) and (2) the total number of meetings of all committees of the board on which such director served (during the periods that           such director served).  We encourage all incumbent directors and nominees for election as directors to attend our annual meetings.  All of our current directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
Board Committees
The Company's board of directors conducts much of its business through committees, including a standing audit committee,           nominating and governance committee and compensation committee.
Audit Committee
The board of directors of the Company has designated a standing audit committee, currently consisting of Messrs. Flocco           (chair), Spevak and Wildstein. All members of the audit committee are independent as defined under the applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of NASDAQ, including the independence criteria applicable to audit committee members.  The board           of directors has determined that both Mr. Flocco and Mr. Spevak qualify as audit committee financial experts, as defined in SEC rules and regulations.
The audit committee held nine meetings during 2018, and it operates under a written charter approved by the board.  A           copy of the audit committee's charter is available on the Company's website at www.myrepublicbank.com.  The responsibilities of the audit           committee are to, among others:

Audit Committee Report
The audit committee of the Company's board of directors is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of           the Company's accounting functions and internal controls. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an           independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon. The audit committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
In connection with these responsibilities, the audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated           financial statements of the Company at and for the year ended December 31, 2018, with management and the Company's independent auditor.  As required by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), the audit committee           discussed with BDO USA, LLP ("BDO"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301 "Communication with Audit Committees," issued by the PCAOB.   The audit committee           has received the written disclosures and the letter from BDO required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding its communications with the audit committee concerning BDO's independence, and has discussed with BDO its independence.
-12-
Based upon the audit committee's review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting           firm referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with           the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Respectfully submitted,

Compensation Committee
The board of directors of the Company has designated a standing compensation committee, currently consisting of Messrs.           Spevak (chair) and Flocco and Ms. Jacobs.
The compensation committee operates under a written charter approved by the board.  A copy of the compensation           committee's charter is available on the Company's website at www.myrepublicbank.com.  The charter provides, among other things, that the           compensation committee be comprised of at least three members.
All members of the compensation committee have been determined by the board to be independent under NASDAQ listing           standards, "non-employee directors," as defined in SEC Rule 16b-3, and "outside directors," as defined for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m).  The compensation committee held five meetings in 2018.  The compensation committee's           responsibilities include, among others, the following:

Compensation Processes and Procedures
The compensation committee meets at such times as it determines to be necessary or appropriate, but not less than once a           year.  The compensation committee has the authority to establish the compensation of the chief executive officer and other executive officers of the Company and the Bank and may not delegate such authority, except to a sub-committee. The chief           executive officer has the responsibility for proposing the amount and form of compensation of the other executive officers of the Company and the Bank and the compensation committee consults with the chief executive officer on such matters.
The compensation committee is also responsible for periodically reviewing the amount and form of director compensation           paid to non-employee directors.  The compensation committee recommends proposed changes in director compensation to the board as appropriate, from time to time, and any changes in director compensation are approved by the board.
Nominations and Shareholder Communications
Nominating and Governance Committee
The board of directors of the Company has designated a standing nominating and governance committee, currently           consisting of Messrs. Wildstein (chair), Cohen, Spevak and Tierney.
-14-
All members of the nominating and governance committee have been determined by the board to be independent under NASDAQ           listing standards.  The nominating and governance committee held one meeting in 2018.  The nominating and governance committee operates under a written charter approved by the board.  A copy of the nominating and governance committee's charter is           available on the Company's website at www.myrepublicbank.com.
In addition to the responsibilities described below regarding overseeing the selection and recommendation of board           nominees, the nominating and governance committee's responsibilities include, among other things, the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• make recommendations to the Board from time to time as to changes that the Committee believes to be desirable in the size of the Board or any committee                        thereof and the establishment of any new committees of the Board that the Committee believes to be necessary or desirable;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conduct annually an evaluation of the performance of the board as a whole and the directors in such manner as the committee deems appropriate and, through                        its chairperson, communicate this evaluation to the full board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maintain an orientation program for new directors and an education program for continuing directors.  
[END TABLE]
The nominating and governance committee also oversees the composition and operation of the Company's board, including           identifying individuals qualified to become board members, recommending to the board director nominees for the annual meetings of shareholders, and filling vacancies occurring between annual shareholder meetings. It identifies director candidates           by considering the recommendations of the Company's directors, executive officers and shareholders, as well as those of experts and consultants of the Company.  The nominating and governance committee evaluates candidates it has identified or who           have been recommended to it based on the selection criteria provided in the nominating and governance committee charter and other criteria deemed relevant by the nominating and governance committee, including each candidate's background and           experience, the candidate's ability to understand the business, financial affairs and complexities of the Company and the Company's business, the candidate's willingness and ability to spend the necessary time required to function effectively as           a director, the candidate's open-minded approach to matters and the resolve to independently analyze matters presented for consideration, as well as the candidate's ability to act in the best interest of the Company's shareholders, and the           candidate's reputation for honesty and integrity.
While the nominating and corporate governance committee does not have a formal policy regarding director diversity, it           believes that the directors should encompass a range of experience, viewpoints, qualifications, attributes and skills in order to provide sound and prudent guidance to the Company's management.  The nominating and corporate governance committee           considers diversity in connection with its review of each potential director candidate and is satisfied that the current composition of the board of directors reflects its commitment to diversity.  The nominating and corporate governance           committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees.
-15-
The nominating and governance committee evaluates director candidates recommended by shareholders in the same manner           that it evaluates other director candidates.  The procedures for shareholders to recommend director candidates are described under the heading "Shareholder Proposals and Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting".
Shareholder Communications
Any shareholder may communicate with our board, or any individual member or members of the board, by directing his, her           or its communication to Kemma Brown, Corporate Secretary, Republic First Bancorp, Inc., Two Liberty Place, 50 South 16th Street, Suite 2400, Philadelphia, PA 19102, together with a request to forward the communication to the intended recipient or           recipients.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview of the             Executive Compensation Program.  Our executive compensation program includes a number of fixed and variable compensation and benefit components typical of programs among comparable community banking and financial services companies in           our local and regional marketplace.  The program seeks to provide participating executives with an industry-competitive level of total compensation.
Our named executive officers receive from the Company a combination of base salary, health and welfare benefits, bonus           compensation, long-term incentive compensation in the form of stock option awards, and other perquisites.
Compensation Philosophy             and Program Objectives.  We believe that the compensation program for executives should directly support the achievement of annual, longer-term and strategic goals of the business, and, thereby, align the interests of executives with the           interests of our shareholders.
We believe the current program provides sufficient levels of fixed income, in the forms of base salary and health and           welfare benefits, to attract high caliber executive talent to the organization.  We believe it also provides competitive annual bonus and longer-term incentive opportunities to encourage performance and to reward the successful efforts of           executives.
The incentive opportunities are based on an executive's role in our organization, company and individual performance,           maintaining a compensation program that is competitive in our industry and markets, and other factors.  Our current program contains certain compensation features, provided on a selective basis, to encourage retention through long-term wealth           accumulation opportunities and to assure transition support in the event of substantial organization or ownership change.  These provisions are designed to support retention of good performers by the organization.
We believe that the features and composition of the current program are consistent with practices of other comparable           community banking and financial services organizations in our marketplace and that the program balances the need for competitive pay opportunities at the executive level with shareholders' expectations for reasonable return on their investment.
Program Management.                The compensation committee of the board of directors has primary responsibility for the design and administration of the compensation of the chief executive officer of the Company and the Bank, and makes decisions with respect to the compensation           program for other executive officers. The compensation committee will consider the make-up and administration of the executive compensation program in light of changing organization needs and operating conditions and changing trends in industry           practice.
Role of Executive             Management in the Compensation Decision Process.  The compensation committee is responsible for approving compensation of our chief executive officer and other executive officers.  In determining the compensation of the chief executive           officer of the Company and the Bank, the compensation committee considers and evaluates his individual and corporate performance and data with respect to the compensation of the chief executive officers of the peer group identified below under           the heading "Basis for Defining Competitive Compensation Levels and Practices."  For the other executive officers of the Company and the Bank,           the chief executive officer will make recommendations to the compensation committee with respect to the compensation of such executive officers.  In formulating its decisions, the compensation committee may seek information about the performance           of the business, organization staffing requirements and the performance levels of incumbent executives from our chief executive officer.  It may also utilize the services of our chief financial officer and other officers to the extent the           compensation committee deems appropriate.  None of our named executive officers had a role in recommending or setting his or her own compensation.
-21-
Program Review and             Compensation Decision Process.  Periodically, the compensation committee reviews information on executive compensation levels in the industry and industry program practices, reviews our compensation program, and considers adjustments to           the program, salary adjustments and incentive awards.  The compensation committee will examine the current compensation and benefit levels of executive officers in light of their continuing or changing roles in the business and the assessments of           their individual performances by the compensation committee or the chief executive officer.  It will also approve annual bonus compensation, after consideration of Company and individual performance, but which is ultimately discretionary.
The compensation committee may also be called upon to consider compensation related decisions throughout the calendar           year as executives are reassigned or promoted and new executive officers join the organization.  In these instances, the compensation committee will review all aspects of the executive officer's compensation including base salary level, annual           incentive opportunities, longer-term incentive awards, participation in special benefit plans, and employment contract provisions, if applicable.
Compensation Decision             Factors and Considerations.  The following factors typically influence compensation committee decisions on salary and benefits for our executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary:  executive's overall performance during the                        year ending, changes in organization role and scope of responsibility, current salary in relation to the position's market value, any significant changes in the industry's pay practices for comparable positions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discretionary Annual Bonus Compensation:                         competitive industry practice with respect to size of awards, actual performance of the Company against budget and performance of executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Longer-term Incentive Awards:  competitive industry                        practice with respect to size of awards, recent performance of the Company and the individual executive, applicable accounting rules for expensing equity awards, and shareholder concerns about dilution and overhang.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nonqualified Compensation and Benefits:  tax rules                        on qualified benefit plans, likely replacement income benefits for executives compared to other categories of employees within the organization, competitive industry practice for comparable type and level of executive positions.  
[END TABLE]
-22-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Perquisites:  the needs of the executive's position,                        frequency of travel to other Company locations, or to meet with Company clients and prospective clients, and competitive industry practices for comparable executive roles.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employment Agreements:  where they serve Company                        needs for confidentiality about business practices and plans, preservation of the customer base (non-competition and non-solicitation provisions), competitive industry practices and employee retention.  
[END TABLE]
Basis for Defining             Competitive Compensation Levels and Practices. The types and levels of compensation included in the Company's executive compensation program are generally consistent with current features and programming trends among similar           organizations of comparable size in our local and regional marketplace.
The compensation committee considers information about the practices of the Company's peers and other comparable           companies, as well as evolving market practices when it makes compensation decisions. The committee considers the compensation levels and arrangements of similarly situated executives in addition to other factors in connection with its decision           making process. Duties, responsibilities, and tenure with the Company are also considered in the committee's compensation decisions.
The compensation committee may review survey reports on national and regional compensation practice within the Company's           industry group, focusing on pay levels and practices among community banking and diversified financial services institutions based in the Mid-Atlantic Region and specifically the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan marketplace, having a level of           total assets comparable to our own.  This range of institutions represents banking companies that are somewhat smaller and somewhat larger than the Company.
The committee reviews the peer group on an annual basis and updates the group as appropriate to ensure that the peer           group continues to consist of financial institutions with business models and demographics similar to Republic First Bancorp. The financial institutions that comprise our peer group may change as a result of acquisitions, growth, expansion, and           changes in the business focus of Republic First Bancorp or our peer institutions.
For the 2018 program planning cycle, the compensation committee reviewed executive compensation information for the           following peer group, which were publicly traded financial institutions headquartered in Pennsylvania and New Jersey with total assets between $1.0 billion and $4.8 billion, based on public information available through the internet and documents           filed with the SEC.

In addition, the compensation committee authorized the engagement of BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") to conduct a competitive           market analysis of total direct compensation for the executive management team using a blend of public peer company data and published survey data. BDO is also the independent registered public accounting firm that provides audit and tax services           to the Company. For 2018, BDO invoiced the Company for approximately $388,000 in fees and expenses related to its services. This amount includes approximately $18,000 for fees in connection with its advisory services to the compensation           committee. The Compensation Committee has reviewed all services provided by BDO and, after consideration of such services and other factors prescribed by the SEC for purposes of assessing independence, has determined that the engagement of BDO           does not raise any conflicts of interest with the Company or any of its directors or executive officers.
The committee reviewed an analysis prepared by BDO which benchmarked the executive compensation levels and compensation           practices of forty publicly traded financial institutions headquartered in the northeastern region of the U.S. These institutions were located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania and had total assets           ranging from $1.0 billion to $4.2 billion. The analysis provided the committee with a broad array of information from which to assess the effectiveness of its compensation program and serve as a foundation for compensation decisions.
Program Components.                There are six elements in the current executive compensation program:
Base Salary.            Base salary opportunities are based on industry practice for comparable jobs in similar community banking and financial service organizations comparable in size.  Within the defined competitive range, an executive's salary level is based           initially on his qualifications for the assignment and experience in similar level and type roles.  Ongoing, salary adjustments reflect the individual's overall performance of the job against organization expectations and may also reflect changes           in industry practices.
Health & Welfare             Benefits.  Executives participate in Company's qualified health and welfare benefits program on the same terms and conditions as all other employees of the Company.
Annual Performance             Incentives.  The Company pays bonus compensation which provides executives with opportunities to earn additional cash compensation in a given year.  Bonus compensation is discretionary, but Company and business unit operating results and           individual performance contributions are considered.  Typical annual performance metrics for Company executives include net income, asset, loan and deposit growth, return on average assets, return on average equity, and successful execution of           the Company's expansion strategy.  The determination of actual bonus amounts is not formulaic, but, rather, the result of a review of achievements by the chief executive officer and the compensation committee and the application of prevailing           industry practices on annual incentive awards.
Longer-term Performance             Incentives.  Executives are eligible to participate in longer-term incentive award plans established to focus executive efforts on the strategic directions and goals of the business and to reward them for their successes in increasing           enterprise value, as well as shareholder value.  Awards can result in additional cash compensation or equity under our equity compensation plans.  While the size of such awards may increase or decrease based on current business performance, it is           the intention of the compensation committee to recommend some combination of the available awards at least annually as an incentive to focus executives' future efforts on longer-term needs and objectives of the business.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity Compensation Plan.  Our equity compensation                        plan authorizes us to award stock options, restricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights to our eligible employees, including our executives. Our compensation committee is the administrator of the Plan.  We may make                        equity awards at the commencement of employment and from time to time to meet other specific retention or performance objectives, or for other reasons.  Periodic awards are made at the discretion of the compensation committee to                        eligible employees and, in appropriate circumstances, the compensation committee considers the recommendations of the chief executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deferred Compensation.  The Company maintains a                        deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain employees and members of the Board of Directors.  This plan was previously frozen to new participants and Mr. Madonna is the only named executive officer who remains eligible for                        participation.  As such, he may receive, at the compensation committee's discretion, a company contribution in an amount determined by the compensation committee.  Contributions vest three years after the plan year to which the                        contribution applies, or sooner upon a change of control.  The value and any earnings on participant accounts are determined by the changes in value of the investments selected by the participant, including the Company's common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Nonqualified Benefits             and Perquisites.  We currently do not offer a nonqualified deferred compensation benefit to any of our executives, except that our chief executive officer, as a former non-employee director, has an account balance in a now frozen           retirement income plan for directors.
Perquisites for Company executives are generally limited to automobile allowances or the use of a Company-provided           automobile, and, in a very few instances, a club membership.  Typically, these perquisites are provided in instances where such benefits can facilitate the conduct of business with corporate and high net worth clients.
Employment and Change             in Control Agreements.  We have entered into employment agreements with each of the named executive officers, in each case because the agreements served certain Company objectives and were consistent with competitive industry practices.           All of the agreements include severance benefits, whether or not in connection with a change in control of the Company, and obligations of the named executive officers to maintain confidentiality about business practices and plans, and for the           preservation of our operations and customer base through restrictive covenants, including noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions. See "Description of Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
2018 Compensation             Decisions.  The salaries of each of the named executive officers were initially set in accordance with their existing employment agreements and are subject to adjustment based on an annual review by the compensation committee. In making           final decisions on compensation of the executive management team for 2018, the compensation committee assessed the individual performance of each named executive officer and also evaluated the overall performance of the Company during the prior           year.

2017 produced strong results through "The Power of Red is Back" growth campaign. Deposits and loans grew at exceptional           rates. The store network expanded to twenty-two convenient locations and the Company solidified its position as one of the top residential mortgage lenders in its market through the successful integration of the Oak Mortgage team into the Bank.           In addition, the reduction in the corporate tax rate included in Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will result in a significant financial benefit in the years to come. Management intends on utilizing the savings generated by this Act to invest in           growth and expansion which will result in the creation of new jobs, improvements in technology and the ability to further contribute to the communities which the Company serves.
The expansion plan will not only focus on the addition of new Store locations, but also includes a commitment to deliver           exceptional service and convenience though all delivery channels, including mobile and on-line banking options. As competitors continue to shutter the doors on their branch network and offer declining levels of customer service, management           focuses on opportunities to successfully execute the growth plan.
Additional highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the following accomplishments:

Status of Practices             Going Forward.  Payment of discretionary cash bonuses will continue to be assessed in the future based on individual performance and the operating results of the Company.  Stock option grants are likely to continue with the size of           awards tracking with the performance results of the business.  The compensation committee will evaluate award opportunities for executives based upon an annual review of all relevant information available to them to ensure they are in line with           performance results.
Employment Agreements.                The compensation committee has responsibility for review of current and proposed employment agreements and will specifically authorize contract renewals.
Compliance with             Sections 162(m) and 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that publicly held corporations may not deduct compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1,000,000           annually.  Historically, options issued under our stock option plans were structured to qualify as "performance-based compensation" eligible for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction           limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it           qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Company believes its compensation policies reflect due consideration of Section 162(m).  We reserve the right, however, to use our judgment to           authorize compensation payments in excess of the Section 162(m) limitations when we believe that such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of our shareholders, after taking into consideration changing business conditions or the           executive officer's performance.
It is also our intention to maintain our executive compensation arrangements in conformity with the requirements of           Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which imposes certain restrictions on deferred compensation arrangements.

[END TABLE]
Employment Agreement             with Mr. Madonna.  In May 2013, the Company and the Bank entered into an employment agreement, effective June 1, 2013 with Harry D. Madonna, Chairman of the board of directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and           Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. The agreement replaced and superseded Mr. Madonna's prior employment agreement which was set to expire on December 31, 2013. On March 18, 2015, the Company, the Bank and Mr. Madonna agreed to amend the           employment agreement.
The agreement provides for Mr. Madonna's continuing service as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and           Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. The agreement is extended on each annual anniversary date to provide for a three-year term unless either party provides written notice that they desire to terminate the           agreement within six months of the termination date.  The Company and the Bank may also terminate Mr. Madonna's employment at any time for specified events of "good reason" (as defined in the agreement). Mr. Madonna may terminate the agreement           with six months prior notice.  Mr. Madonna may also terminate the agreement for specified events of "good cause" (as defined in the agreement).
Mr. Madonna's annual base salary under the amended agreement was set at $415,000 effective March 1, 2015. Mr. Madonna is           eligible to receive annual increases in base salary at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company after taking into account criteria determined in advance by the Committee, and bonuses based on a percent of annual base           salary in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee upon achievement of established criteria.  Since the effective date of the amended agreement, the Committee has accepted Mr. Madonna's recommendation to forgo annual increases to his           base salary and payment of a cash bonus. Any additional compensation has been granted in the form of equity based awards to better align his interests with those of the Company's shareholders.
-30-
The amended employment agreement also provides for the annual issuance of options to Mr. Madonna to purchase not less           than 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock effective March 12, 2015 and continuing annually thereafter so long as Mr. Madonna remains employed under the terms of the agreement. Option grants will be based on meeting or exceeding criteria           established from year to year by the committee charged with the responsibility for making grants under the Company's stock incentive plan. Such options will vest one year after the date of grant or earlier upon the occurrence of either a Change           in Control (as defined in the agreement) or a Termination Event (as defined below) and will be granted at a per share exercise price equal to fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
Mr. Madonna will also be entitled to certain other customary perquisites, including use of an automobile and           reimbursement of related operating expenses, health and disability insurance available to all employees, and reimbursement for travel, entertainment and club dues and expenses.  Under the agreement, the Company and the Bank also agree to           reimburse Mr. Madonna for the cost of term life insurance policies providing a death benefit in the amount of $4.0 million.
Mr. Madonna's agreement provides for certain severance and change in control benefits.  In the event of termination of           Mr. Madonna's employment for any reason, including a merger or sale of the Company or the Bank or transfer of a majority of the stock of the Company or the Bank (any one of which shall be considered a "Change in Control") or failure by the           Company and the Bank to continue his employment at the termination of the agreement or any subsequent employment agreement, or if Mr. Madonna is not elected a member of the boards of directors of the Company or the Bank or upon agreement that Mr.           Madonna is to transition from service as chief executive officer to service as a non-employee director of the Company and the Bank (each a "Termination Event"), Mr. Madonna would be entitled to receive a severance payment in the amount of $1.6           million, five years of continued health and other benefits, and life insurance or cash in an amount equal to the cost of such insurance.  Mr. Madonna would not be entitled to any severance or other payments in the event that his employment           terminates as a result of death, resignation by him without good cause, or termination by the Company or the Bank for good reason.  Subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, all severance payments are to be made in a           lump sum within 30 days after the applicable termination event.
In the event of a merger or sale or transfer of a majority of the stock of the Company or the Bank while Mr. Madonna           remains employed by the Company and the Bank or remains serving as a director (or within one year after Mr. Madonna ceases to provide any services to either the Company or the Bank in any capacity), he will be entitled, in addition to any other           compensation payable to him under the agreement, to a transaction bonus in an amount determined by the compensation committees of the Company and the Bank, which amount cannot be less than $1.0 million.  The transaction bonus is payable within 30           days following consummation of the transaction giving rise to payment of such bonus.
The agreement provides for non-disclosure by Mr. Madonna of any confidential information relating to the business of the           Company or the Bank during or after the period of his employment, except in the course of employment related duties.  In the event that the amounts and benefits payable under the agreement are such that Mr. Madonna becomes subject to the excise           tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Madonna will be entitled to receive a tax gross-up payment to reimburse him for the amount of such excise taxes.  He will also receive a tax gross-up payment for certain other taxes           payable by him with respect to certain perquisites under the agreement.

Employment Agreements             with Messrs. Logue, Cavallaro and Neilon and Ms. Young.  On July 14, 2015, the Bank entered into employment agreements with each of Andrew J. Logue, President and Chief Operating           Officer of the Bank; Frank A. Cavallaro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Bank; Jay M. Neilon, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of the Bank; and Tracie A. Young, Executive Vice President           and Chief Risk Officer of the Bank.  Each of the employment agreements is for a one-year term commencing on July 1, 2015, with annual renewals thereafter absent notice of non-renewal by either party at least six months prior to an annual renewal           date.
Under the employment agreements, each executive officer is entitled to receive a specified annual base salary and is           eligible to participate in other compensation plans or programs maintained by the Company or the Bank for senior executive officers, including stock compensation, retirement, savings and similar plans.  Each executive officer is also able to earn           an annual bonus based on criteria established by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.  The annual base salary amounts for each of Messrs. Logue, Cavallaro and Neilon and Ms. Young initially set forth in their respective           employment agreements were $365,750, $239,250, $254,750, and $194,250, respectively.
In the event of termination of an executive officer's employment, including resignation by the officer for specified           events of "good reason" or a failure to continue an officer's employment at termination of the employment agreement, the officer would be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to two times the officer's base salary in effect immediately           prior to termination (the "Severance Payment").  If the executive's employment is terminated as a result of, or in contemplation of, a change in control of the Company, the executive would be entitled to receive the Severance Payment unless the           executive accepts a position after the change of control in the surviving company.  No severance is payable in the event of termination of an executive's employment for specified events of "cause," or as a result of an executive's death,           disability or resignation without good reason.
The employment agreements include customary provisions relating to non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and           employees for a period of twelve months following termination of employment.  The employment agreements replace and supersede any prior employment or change in control agreements to which any of the executive officers were a party.
Stock Option Plans.                The Company maintained the Stock Option Plan and Restricted Stock Plan of Republic First Bancorp, Inc., which originally became effective on November 15, 1995 and was amended and approved at the Company's 2005 annual meeting of shareholders.  We           refer this plan as the "2005 Plan."  In accordance with the terms of the 2005 Plan, the Company was able to award stock options, restricted stock, and stock appreciation rights to employees, directors, and certain consultants.  Under the 2005           Plan, 1.5 million shares of common stock, plus an annual increase equal to the number of shares needed to restore the maximum number of shares available for grant under the plan to 1.5 million shares, were available for such awards.  As of           December 31, 2015, the only grants under the 2005 Plan had been option grants.  This plan provided that the exercise price of each option granted equals the market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant.  Any option granted vests           within one to four years and has a maximum term of ten years.  The 2005 Plan terminated on November 15, 2015 in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the plan agreement.
-32-
In 2014, the Company adopted, and the shareholders approved, the 2014 Republic First Bancorp, Inc. Equity Incentive           Plan, which we refer to as the "2014 Plan."  Under this plan the Company may award shares of the Company's common stock through incentive or nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights to the Company's           employees, directors, independent contractors, and certain consultants.  In accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan, 2.6 million shares of common stock, plus an annual increase equal to the greater of (i) the number of shares needed to restore           the maximum number of shares available for grant under the plan to 2.6 million shares or (ii) 10% of the number of shares of outstanding common stock on the last trading day of the preceding calendar year, are available for such awards.  At           December 31, 2018, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under the 2014 Plan was 6.0 million.
The 2014 Plan provides that the exercise price of each option granted equals the fair market price of the Company's           common stock on the date of grant, except with respect to incentive stock options awarded to certain 10% shareholders, which have an exercise price of no less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant.  All options have a maximum           term of 10 years, except with respect to incentive stock options awarded to certain 10% shareholders, which have a maximum term of five years. The Company does not currently have any shareholders that own 10% or more of the common shares           outstanding and has not issued any options through the 2014 Plan under the terms and conditions applicable to 10% shareholders.
Stock options generally expire upon termination of employment for cause.  In the event of a termination other than for           cause, a vested incentive stock option must be exercised within three months from the date of termination of employment or within twelve months in the event of termination for disability.
Awards made under the 2014 Plan may have service and/or performance vesting requirements as the Compensation Committee           may determine.

 Harry D. Madonna   Amended and Restated Supplemental Retirement Plan   26   210,883  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Madonna's years of credited service and the present value of his accumulated benefit were determined as of December 31, 2018, which is the same pension                        plan measurement date that the Company used for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Years of credited service reflect the number of years                        since the plan was adopted.  
[END TABLE]
In 1992, the Company adopted a supplemental retirement plan for non-employee directors.  The plan was frozen to new           participants in 1992, but the Company continues to maintain the plan for participants who served as non-employee directors in 1992.  At that time, Mr. Madonna was a non-employee director and he continues to be a participant in the plan.  The           present value of accumulated benefit was calculated based upon the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits, calculated as of December 31, 2018, as described below.  The plan provides for a retirement benefit of $25,000 per year for ten           years, which payments may begin at the later of actual retirement date or 65 years of age.  Mr. Madonna has reached 65 years of age and the amount shown in the table above represents the present value of the accumulated benefit amount necessary           to fund $25,000 annual payments over a ten year period commencing December 31, 2018, which was the end of the Company's most recently completed fiscal year.  Present value was calculated using a 4% discount rate.

 Harry D. Madonna   -   -   (25,626)   -   612,239  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Madonna's deferred compensation account is credited with gains, losses and expenses as if it had been invested in shares of certain publicly traded                        mutual funds as allowed by the plan.  The amount reported is not included in the Summary Compensation Table.  
(2)  Company contributions to the deferred compensation plan vest over a three year period or upon completion of a change in control, as defined in the plan.  At                        December 31, 2018, the aggregate balance of $612,239 was fully vested.  
[END TABLE]
The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain officers and directors. As of December 31,           2009, no additional individuals may participate in the plan and Mr. Madonna is the only named executive officer who is an eligible participant.  The plan permits participants to make elective contributions to their accounts, subject to applicable           provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition, the Company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts.  Company contributions are subject to vesting, and generally vest three years after the end of the plan year to which           the contribution applies, subject to acceleration of vesting upon certain changes in control (as defined in the plan) and to forfeiture upon termination for cause (as defined in the plan).  Participant accounts are adjusted to reflect           contributions and distributions, and income, gains, losses, and expenses as if the accounts had been invested in permitted investments selected by the participants, including Company common stock.  The plan provides for distributions upon           retirement and, subject to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, limited hardship withdrawals.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Termination or Change             in Control Provisions in Agreements.  The Company and the Bank are parties to employment agreements that provide severance benefits to the named executive officers under certain circumstances in the event of termination of their           employment, including as a result of a change in control of the Company or the Bank.  For a description of such agreements, see "Description of Employment Agreements."
Termination or Change             in Control Provision in Deferred Compensation Plan.  Our deferred compensation plan provides that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a participant is 100 percent vested as to amounts voluntarily deferred by the participant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any company contributions will be 100 percent vested upon a "change of control" (as defined in the deferred compensation plan).  
[END TABLE]
A participant's benefits in the deferred compensation plan are payable as soon as practicable following a termination of           employment from the Company.  Mr. Madonna is the only named executive officer who is an eligible participant in the deferred compensation plan.
Change in Control             Provisions in the Company's Equity Compensation Plans.  The Company's equity compensation plans each provide that all outstanding stock options become immediately exercisable upon a change of control of the Company (as defined in the           Plans).  The Plans also provide that upon a change of control of the Company, all restrictions on the transfer of restricted shares granted under the Plans which have not been forfeited prior to such date shall lapse.
The following table shows the estimated amount of payments and benefits that would be provided by the Company to the           named executive officers under the plans and agreements described above, that were in effect as of December 31, 2018, assuming their employment was terminated as of December 31, 2018, for various reasons as described below.

(1)  Represents amounts payable in accordance with terms of employment agreement including a fixed sum equal to $1.59 million as consideration for Mr. Madonna's                        services to the Company prior to termination. Also includes $612,239, representing benefits payable under the deferred compensation plan, and $210,883, representing the present value of Mr. Madonna's supplemental retirement benefits,                        or ten annual payments of $25,000 each, determined using a 4% discount rate. The total cash payment due in connection with a change in control includes a transaction bonus in the amount of $1.0 million plus reimbursement of certain                        excise taxes that may become payable in connection with this termination payment.  In lieu of annual supplemental retirement benefit payments, Mr. Madonna may elect to receive an assignment of a life insurance policy, which had a cash                        surrender value of $260,240 at December 31, 2018.  The amounts detailed above are payable within 30 days of a termination event.  
(2)  Represents a lump sum severance payment due in accordance with employment agreement in an amount equal to two times the Executive's annual base salary in                        effect immediately prior to termination.

Chief Executive Officer − Pay Ratio Disclosure
The following pay ratio information is provided in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of SEC regulation           S-K.
For fiscal 2018, the Company's last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than the Chief Executive Officer) was $65,766; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Harry D. Madonna, was $863,328.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio for 2018 of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the           median of the annual total compensation of all employees is 13 to 1.
The following steps were taken to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee and the Chief Executive           Officer:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SEC rules allow us to identify our median employee once every three years unless there has been a change in our employee population or employee compensation                        arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosure. For fiscal 2018, we believe no such changes occurred. Accordingly, we used the median employee identified for fiscal 2017 and                        quantified that employee's total annual compensation for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As of December 31, 2017, the employee population consisted of approximately 462 individuals, including full time, part time, temporary, and seasonal                        employees employed on that date.  This date was selected because it aligned with calendar year end and allowed identification of employees in a reasonably efficient manner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For purposes of identifying the median employee from our employee population base, wages from our internal payroll records for the twelve month period ended                        December 31, 2017 were used. These wages were consistent with amounts reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for fiscal 2017. Consistent with the calculation of the Chief Executive Officer's annual compensation, other                        elements of employee compensation were considered and added, if applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition, the compensation of approximately 134 full time or part time employees who were hired during 2017 and employed on December 31, 2017 was                        annualized.  No full time equivalent adjustments were made for part time employees, of which there were approximately 50.  
[END TABLE]
-39-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median employee was identified using this compensation measure and methodology, which was consistently applied to all employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median employee's annual total compensation for the twelve month period ending December 31, 2018 was equal to $65,766.                       
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount reported in the Total column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table was used for the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer.

Director Compensation
The compensation committee reviews the components of director compensation on an annual basis. When establishing           compensation levels for 2018, the committee reviewed director compensation information for the same peer group evaluated when assessing executive compensation levels. This peer group included fifteen publicly traded financial institutions           headquartered in Pennsylvania and New Jersey with total assets between $1.0 billion and $4.8 billion. The committee also reviewed an analysis prepared by BDO USA, LLP, an independent, external consultant which benchmarked director compensation           levels and practices of forty public traded financial institutions of comparable size headquartered in the northeastern region of the U.S.
The following table sets forth information regarding compensation paid by the Company to its non-employee directors           during 2018.

On February 22, 2018, we made annual grants of stock options to our non-employee directors, at the exercise price of           $8.40 per share which vest in full on the one year anniversary of the grant date.  Under the annual grant, we awarded options to purchase 100,000 shares to the Chairman of the Board and 25,000 shares of common stock to each of the remaining           non-employee directors.
Certain non-employee directors, namely Messrs. Spevak and Wildstein, are also eligible to participate in a nonqualified           deferred compensation plan.  Mr. Spevak's deferred compensation account is credited with gains, losses and expenses as if it had been invested in the common stock of the Company and shares of certain publicly traded mutual funds as allowed by the           plan.  In fiscal 2018, Mr. Spevak's deferred compensation account was credited with a gain of $4,074.  Mr. Wildstein's deferred compensation account is credited with gains, losses and expenses as if it had been invested in the common stock of the           Company and shares of certain publicly traded mutual funds as allowed by the plan.  In fiscal 2018, Mr. Wildstein's deferred compensation account was credited with a loss of $21,687.
Services Agreement with Chairman
On March 9, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Vernon W. Hill, II regarding his provision of services to           the Company as Chairman of the board of directors.  The initial term of the agreement is a five-year period commencing on March 9, 2017.  The agreement will be extended on each annual anniversary date to provide for a five-year term unless either           party provides the other with timely written notice of termination, in which case the agreement will expire four years from the annual anniversary date next following the notice. This agreement replaced the consulting agreement with Mr. Hill that           was initially entered into on June 10, 2008.
Under the agreement, Mr. Hill agrees to serve as Chairman of the board of directors of the Company, to preside over all           meetings of the Company's board of directors and shareholders, and perform such other functions as required of a public company board chairman and such other duties as the Company's board of directors may require.  For services under the           agreement, Mr. Hill will receive base compensation ("compensation") of not less than $360,000 per year, and he will be entitled to participate in any bonus programs, incentive compensation plans, stock option plans or similar benefit or           compensation plans at any time in effect that are made generally available to directors and executive officers of the Company.
The Company may terminate Mr. Hill's services under the agreement at any time with or without "cause" (as defined in the           agreement).  In the event of a termination by the Company for cause, Mr. Hill would be entitled to any prorated portion of his compensation through the termination date and the Company would have no further obligations under the agreement. In the           event that the Company terminates Mr. Hill's services without cause, the Company would be required to pay Mr. Hill, in a lump-sum, compensation due to him until the end of the then current term of the agreement.  The Company may also terminate           the agreement for permanent disability, in which case Mr. Hill would receive a portion of his compensation for the balance of the remaining term of the agreement offset by any disability payments due to Mr. Hill under any company-sponsored           disability plan.  In the event of death, Mr. Hill's estate would be entitled to a death benefit equal to three times compensation.
-41-
Mr. Hill may voluntarily terminate his services under the agreement for specified events of "good reason" occurring           within three years after a change in control of the Company.  In the event of Mr. Hill's voluntary termination for any of such events of good reason following a change in control of the Company, he would be entitled to a payment equal to four           times compensation.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with related persons
The Bank has made, and expects to continue to make in the future, loans to directors and executive officers of the           Company and the Bank, and to their family members, and to firms, corporations, and other entities in which they and their family members maintain interests.  None of such loans are nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problems, and all           of such loans were made in the ordinary course of  business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company or the Bank and           did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
The Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Hill, dated June 10, 2008.  On March 9, 2017, the Company           entered into a new agreement with Mr. Hill regarding his provision of services to the Company as Chairman of the board of directors.  The March 9, 2017 agreement replaces in its entirety, the prior consulting agreement with Mr. Hill that was           initially entered into on June 10, 2008.
Mr. Hill is Chairman of the board of directors and a beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Company's           outstanding common stock. Accordingly, he and his wife are considered related persons.  Pursuant to the agreements described above, Mr. Hill received $360,000 during 2018 and $341,707 during 2017 as compensation for his role on the board of           directors and consulting services. In addition, we paid $400,000 and $361,000 during 2018 and 2017, respectively, to InterArch Design, Inc., a company that is wholly-owned by Mr. Hill's wife, for marketing, graphic design, architectural, and           project management services. We paid $165,000 and $172,000 during 2018 and 2017, respectively, to Glassboro Properties, LLC related to a land lease             agreement for our Glassboro store.  Mr. Hill has an ownership interest in Glassboro Properties LLC, which is a commercial real estate firm.
We paid $120,000 during both 2018 and 2017, to Brian Communications for public relations services. Brian Tierney, a           member of the Board of Directors, is the CEO of Brian Communications, a strategic communications agency.
Review, approval or ratification of transactions with               related persons
All transactions, including arrangements and relationships, with related persons that are required to be disclosed           pursuant to Item 404 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K are approved by our board of directors excluding interested parties. Extensions of credit to insiders, including related persons, are made pursuant to a written policy           designed to ensure compliance with Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, the primary federal banking regulation which governs extensions of credit to insiders, and is applicable to the Bank.
-42-
CODE OF ETHICS
The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial           officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions.  The text of the Company's code of ethics is available on the Company's website at www.myrepublicbank.com.

PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We are required to submit a proposal to shareholders for a (non-binding) advisory vote to approve the compensation of           our named executive officers pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive           officers.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the principles, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
As discussed in "Executive Officers and Compensation - Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we believe that our           compensation program for executives should directly support the achievement of annual, longer-term and strategic goals of the business, and, thereby, align the interests of executives with the interests of our shareholders.  Moreover, we believe           that the Company's current program provides sufficient levels of fixed income, in the forms of base salary and health and welfare benefits, to attract high caliber executive talent to the organization, while it also provides competitive annual           bonus and longer-term incentive opportunities to encourage performance and to reward the successful efforts of executives.  Additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about executive compensation for the           fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are described on pages 20 to 40 of this proxy statement.
Accordingly, the following resolution is submitted for shareholder vote at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Republic First Bancorp, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of its           named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables regarding named           executive officer compensation and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables."
As this is an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on us, our board or the compensation committee, although our           board and the compensation committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.
Unless the Board modifies its policy on the frequency of holding "say-on-pay" advisory votes every two years, the next           "say-on-pay" vote will occur in 2021.
Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED           EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
-44-
PROPOSAL 3
ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF SAY-ON-PAY VOTES
Section 14A of the Exchange Act also provides that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on a non-binding,           advisory basis for their preference on how frequently we should seek future say-on-pay votes. Under this Proposal 3, shareholders may vote to have the say-on-pay vote every year, every two years or every three years. Shareholders also may, if           they wish, abstain from casting a vote on this proposal.
We are required to hold an advisory vote regarding the frequency of "say-on-pay" votes every six years. Our shareholders           were provided with the opportunity to vote on the frequency of "say-on-pay" votes in 2013.
Our board recognizes the importance of shareholder input on executive compensation and has determined that a say-on-pay           vote every two (2) years, the frequency currently utilized by the Company, provides our shareholders with the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers in a timely manner.  We value the opinion of our           shareholders and encourage communication regarding our executive compensation policies and practices. Our board believes that a two-year vote cycle gives the board sufficient time to thoughtfully consider the results of the advisory vote,           implement any desired changes to our executive compensation policies and procedures, and provides investors sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation program as it relates to the business outcomes of the           Company.  Accordingly, the board recommends that the advisory vote on executive compensation occur every two years.  Any shareholder who desires to provide input before the expiration of two years is welcome to contact the board.  See "Board of           Directors and Committees - Shareholder Communications" on page 16 of this proxy statement for contact information.
Although our board recommends that the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation occur every two years,           our shareholders will be given the opportunity to vote in favor of (i) one year; (ii) two years; (iii) three years; or (iv) abstain.  This advisory vote does not approve or disapprove our named executive officers' compensation, but rather advises           our board on how often our shareholders prefer to vote on executive compensation.  While the result of this advisory vote on this proposal is non-binding on our board, our board will consider the overall outcome of the vote in establishing the           frequency that the advisory vote on executive compensation is submitted to our shareholders.
Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE OPTION OF ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS AS           THE PREFERRED FREQUENCY FOR SAY-ON-PAY VOTES.

PROPOSAL 4
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The audit committee has selected BDO USA, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for           the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  Although the Company is not required to do so, the Company believes that it is appropriate for it to request shareholder ratification of the appointment of BDO as its independent registered public           accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  If shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the audit committee will investigate the reasons for the shareholders' rejection and reconsider the appointment, but it will not be           required to and may not change the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  In addition, even if the shareholders ratify the selection of BDO, the audit committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different           independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the audit committee determines that a change is in the best interest of the Company.
The Company has been advised that representatives of BDO will be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to           make a statement if the representatives desire to do so.  It is expected that the representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF BDO           USA, LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.

[END TABLE]
The audit committee meets with our independent auditors to approve the annual scope of accounting services to be           performed and the related fee estimates.  The audit committee also meets with the Company's independent auditors, on a quarterly basis, following completion of their quarterly reviews and annual audit and prior to the Company's earnings           announcements, to review the results of their auditors' work.  During the course of the year, the chairman of the audit committee has the authority to pre-approve requests for services that were not approved in the annual pre-approval process.            The chairman reports any interim pre-approvals at the following quarterly meeting.  At each of the meetings, management and the Company's independent auditors update the audit committee with material changes to any service engagement and related           fee estimates as compared to amounts previously approved.  All of the audit and non-audit services performed by BDO for the Company in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and described above were pre-approved by the audit committee in accordance with the           foregoing procedures.
-47-
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a           registered class of the Company's equity securities (collectively, the "Reporting Persons") to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to furnish the Company with copies of these reports.  Based on the Company's review           of the copies of the reports filed by such persons and written representations, the Company believes that all filings required to be made by Reporting Persons for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were made on a timely           basis with the exception of a Form 4 filing for Mr. Hill related to the conversion of trust preferred securities to common stock and a Form 4 filing for Ms. Young related to the exercise of stock options.
