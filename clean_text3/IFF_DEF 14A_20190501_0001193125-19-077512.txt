Proxy Statement Summary 
2018 Highlights 
We Solidified our Position as a Global Leader in Taste, Scent and Nutrition 
2018 was a transformative year for us. We completed our acquisition of Frutarom, creating a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. Through our acquisition, we significantly increased our product portfolio, including new access to attractive adjacencies, and expanded our customer base to include a significant number of faster-growing small and mid-size customers. We expect that our combined cultures of innovation and partnership will allow us to further capitalize on this expansion and continue to offer our customers innovative and differentiated products. Because our product offerings now extend beyond our legacy Flavors and Fragrances businesses, we have renamed our business units from Flavors to Taste and from Fragrances to Scent, and added Frutarom as a third business unit. 
In 2018, we made notable progress in both our strategic goals and financial performance, and achieved currency neutral growth in all of our key metrics. Our financial results in 2018 reflected continued strong results in our legacy business and the addition of Frutarom results in the fourth quarter.

In addition to successfully completing the Frutarom acquisition, we continued to execute on our strategic priorities in 2018, including the following achievements: 
Ø    Established our 2025 sustainability goals which focuses on Emission Reductions, Zero Waste to Landfill and Water Stewardship; 
Ø    Cosmetic Active Ingredients continued to grow double-digits; 
Ø    TastepointSM in North America continued to grow double-digits; and 
Ø    Opened two new facilities in China, a flavors manufacturing facility and a natural product research lab, supporting our efforts to become a partner of choice and to grow in the region

Director Nominee Experience and Qualifications 
Board Membership Criteria and Selection 
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we have at least six but not more than fifteen directors. To ensure independence and to provide the breadth of needed expertise and diversity of our Board, the Board periodically reviews its size and makes appropriate adjustments pursuant to our By-Laws. Our Nominating and Governance Committee, together with other Board members, from time to time, as appropriate, identifies the need for new Board members. 
Board candidates are considered based on various criteria which may change over time and as the composition of the Board changes. At a minimum, our Nominating and Governance Committee considers the following factors as part of its review of all director candidates and in recommending potential director candidates: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• judgment, character, expertise, skills and knowledge useful to the oversight of our business;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, experiences and other demographics;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• business or other relevant experience; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the extent to which the interplay of the candidate's expertise, skills, knowledge and experience with that  of other Board members will build a Board that is effective, collegial and responsive to our needs and to the requirements and standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").   
[END TABLE]
Proposed director candidates who satisfy the criteria and who otherwise qualify for membership on the Board are identified by the Nominating and Governance Committee. In identifying candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee seeks input and participation from other Board members and other appropriate sources so that all points of view are considered and the best possible candidates identified. The Nominating and Governance Committee also has engaged a search firm to assist it in identifying potential candidates. Members of the Nominating and Governance Committee and other Board members, as appropriate, interview selected director candidates, evaluate the director candidates and determine which candidates are to be recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee to the Board. Our Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the suitability of potential candidates nominated by shareholders in the same manner as other candidates recommended to the Nominating and Governance Committee. 
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  1 
 PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
We believe that each of our nominees has the experience, skills and qualities to fully perform his or her duties as a director and to contribute to our success. Each of our nominees is being nominated because he or she adheres to the highest standards of personal integrity and possesses excellent interpersonal and communication skills, is highly accomplished in his or her field, has an understanding of the interests and issues that are important to our shareholders and is able to dedicate sufficient time to fulfilling his or her obligations as a director. Our nominees as a group complement each other and each other's respective experiences, skills and qualities. 
Diversity and Tenure 
Diversity is one of the factors that the Nominating and Governance Committee considers in identifying and selecting director nominees. As part of this process, the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates how a particular candidate would strengthen and increase the diversity of the Board in terms of how that candidate may contribute to the Board's overall balance of perspectives, backgrounds, knowledge, experience, skill sets and expertise in substantive matters pertaining to our business. To maintain a balance of experience and new perspectives, our Corporate Governance Guidelines also sets guidance on the number of full annual terms that a director can serve on our Board.

Under our By-Laws, if a shareholder wishes to submit a director candidate for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee, or wishes a director nomination to be included in the Company's proxy statement for an annual meeting pursuant to our proxy access by-law, the shareholder must deliver or mail notice of the request to the Company's Corporate Secretary, in writing, so that it is received not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders. However, if the annual meeting is not within 30 days of the anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting, such notice must be received by the Corporate Secretary no later than 10 days following the mailing of notice of the annual meeting or public disclosure of the annual meeting date, whichever occurs first. The notice must be accompanied by the information concerning the director candidate and nominating shareholder described in Article I, Section 3 and Section 4 of our

By-Laws. The Nominating and Governance Committee may also request any additional background or other information from any director candidate or recommending shareholder as it may deem appropriate. Our proxy access by-law permits an eligible shareholder (or group of up to 20 eligible shareholders) who owns shares representing at least 3% of our outstanding shares, and has held the shares for at least 3 years, to nominate and include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting, director candidates constituting up to 20% of our Board. 
Continued Service 
The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews each current Board member's suitability for continued service as a member of our Board and recommends to the Board whether such member should be re-nominated. In addition, each director is required to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee if, during his or her tenure as a director, such director 
[BEGIN TABLE]

• intends to join the board of another for-profit company,

so that the Nominating and Governance Committee can review the change and make a recommendation to the full Board regarding the director's continued service. Such resignation becomes effective only upon acceptance by the Board.

14  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
Corporate Governance 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that applies to all of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and our Chief Accounting Officer. We also have adopted a Code of Conduct for Directors and a Code of Conduct for Executive Officers (together with the Code of Ethics, the "Codes"). The Codes are available through the Investor—Leadership & Governance—Governance link on our website, www.iff.com. 
Only the Board or the Audit Committee may grant a waiver from any provision of our Codes in favor of a director or executive officer, and any such waiver and any amendments to the Codes will be publicly disclosed on our website, www.iff.com. 
Shareholder Engagement 
We regularly engage with our shareholders to better understand their perspectives on our Company, including our strategies, performance, matters of corporate governance and executive compensation. This dialogue has helped inform the Board's decision-making and ensure our interests remain well-aligned with those of our shareholders. During 2018, we interacted with our largest active shareholders, representing approximately two-thirds of our outstanding shares. We believe that all these engagements provide valuable feedback and this feedback is shared regularly with our Board and its relevant committees. As a result of feedback we received from our shareholders in the past few years, we have, among other things, raised our annual dividend, executed our share repurchase program, pursued value-creating acquisitions, completed a perception study on capital allocation preferences, and increased our investor relations exposure with enhanced marketing in key markets in the United States and across continental Europe. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which set forth our governance principles relating to, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• director independence;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our Board has made a determination that the nomination of such person would be in the best interests of our  Company and our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
A director's first full annual term begins on the date he or she is first elected at an annual meeting of shareholders and continues until the next annual meeting of shareholders. Unless a director is an employee of our Company, prior to the conclusion of the twelfth full annual term, the director shall submit his or her resignation as a director effective immediately prior to that year's annual meeting of shareholders. 
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  15 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews our Corporate Governance Guidelines annually, and recommends changes to the Board as appropriate. A copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines is available through the Investor—Leadership & Governance—Governance link on our website, www.iff.com. 
Sustainability Initiatives 
Our sustainability vision—to lead positive transformational changes toward a regenerative, healthy and abundant world—is based on the concept of a circular economy, one that is restorative and regenerative by design. We are leveraging this mindset to transform how we design and manufacture our products and how we engage our employees, customers, suppliers and communities. 
In 2018, IFF was named to Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, the FTSE4Good Index Series and the Euronext Vigeo World 120. Additional achievements included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Launching new environmental goals focused on emission reductions, zero waste to landfill and water stewardship,  an initiative known collectively as "EcoEffective+";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Obtaining FairWild certification for Peru Balsam—the first-ever FairWild-certified flavor and fragrance  ingredient that is commercially available globally; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving a place on the CDP Climate "A" List for the  4th year in a row, as well as an "A" for Water Security for the first time.  
[END TABLE]
We review our sustainability programs and performance in our annual sustainability report, which is posted on our website for investors, customers and suppliers. 
Independence of Directors 
The Board undertakes an annual review of director independence, which includes a review of each director's relationships with the Company. This review is designed to identify and evaluate any transactions or relationships between a director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company or members of our senior management. 
The Board has affirmatively determined that each of our current directors (other than Mr. Fibig, our CEO) meets our independence requirements and those of the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards:

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
Board Leadership Structure 
As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board does not have a policy that requires a separation of the Chairman of the Board ("Chairman") and CEO positions. The Board believes that it is important to have the flexibility to make this determination from time to time based on the particular facts and circumstances then affecting our business. 
Currently, we combine the positions of Chairman and CEO. We believe that the CEO, as the Company's chief executive, is in the best position to fulfill the Chairman's responsibilities, including those related to identifying emerging issues facing our Company, and communicating essential information to the Board about our performance and strategies. We also believe that the combined role of Chairman and CEO provides us with a distinct leader and allows us to present a single, uniform voice to our customers, business partners, shareholders and employees. If at any point in time the Board feels that its current leadership structure may be better served by separating the roles of Chairman and CEO, it may then determine to separate these positions. 
In order to mitigate potential disadvantages of a combined Chairman and CEO, the Board has created the position of Lead Director to facilitate and strengthen the Board's independent oversight of our performance, strategy and succession planning and to promote effective governance standards. The independent directors of the Board elect a Lead Director from among the independent directors. Our current Lead Director is Mr. Morrison.

Board Committees 
Our Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee, each of which operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. Each Committee reviews its charter at least annually and recommends charter changes to the Board as appropriate. In 2018, each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed its charter, and amended it where appropriate. Each Committee charter provides that the Committee will annually review its performance, and each Committee reviewed and discussed its performance in 2018. A current copy of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee charters is available through the Investor—Leadership & Governance—Governance link on our website, www.iff.com.

Board and Committee Assessment Process 
Each year, the Nominating & Governance Committee leads an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and each of its committees. Each member of the Board responds to an anonymous survey regarding the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and their leadership, and the dynamics between the Board and management. In 2018, the Board supplemented this process through the use of in-person director interviews. The Lead Director and the Chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee interviewed 
22  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
 each director to obtain his or her assessment of director performance, Board dynamics and the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. After consulting with each other, the Lead Director and Chair of the Nominating  & Governance Committee summarized and reviewed the results with the Board. 
Succession Planning 
Our Board recognizes that one of its most important duties is to ensure excellence and continuity in our senior leadership by overseeing the development of executive talent and planning for the effective succession of our Chairman and CEO and other senior members of executive management. As part of this process, our CEO and our executive officers are required to prepare a detailed development and succession plan for themselves and for their direct reports on an annual basis. The Company's executives regularly attend Board meetings and maintain an ongoing dialogue with Board members, which is critical to the Company's succession planning. The Compensation Committee reviews, on an annual basis, potential successors for the Company's executive officers and such other senior management employees as the Compensation Committee may determine. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee also agrees upon and recommends to the Board a succession plan for our CEO, including in emergency situations. Our Board is committed to being prepared for a planned or unplanned change in our leadership in order to ensure our stability. 
Risk Management Oversight 
Board and Committee Roles in Overseeing Risk 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS Oversees and reviews our significant risks Audit Committee Oversees financial risks and the policies and practices established to manage such risks, and also oversees and reviews procedures for monitoring compliance with laws and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Nominating and Governance Committee Oversees governance risk and risks arising with CEO succession. Compensation Committee Oversees risks associated with compensation policies and practice, our compensation plans (including equity compensation plans, severance, change in control and other employment-related matters). MANAGEMENT Manages our day-to-day business risks and risk management process 
Our Board is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect our Company and is responsible for overseeing and reviewing with management the Company's enterprise-wide risks and the policies and 
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  23 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 practices established to manage such risks. It is the responsibility of the CEO and other senior management to manage the Company's day-to-day business risks and its risk management process. We believe this division of responsibility is the most effective approach for addressing risk management. 
The Board exercises its risk oversight function both at the Board level and through delegation to its committees. The Board and its committees focus on operational risk, financial risk, regulatory risk, litigation risk, cybersecurity and information security risk, tax risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk, as well as our general risk management strategy, and how these risks are being managed. The Board receives updates on the Company's risk through management's enterprise risk management ("ERM") program report to the Board, which includes management's approach to mitigating and managing such risks. The Board also receives updates on the Company's risk from its committees. Each of the Audit, Nominating and Governance and Compensation Committee are responsible for the oversight of risks relevant to their function (as described above) and regularly report to the Board. The Board believes that its risk oversight structure allows for open communication between the Board, its committees and management. 
Management 
Management maintains an ERM program which is designed to identify and assess our global risks and to develop steps to mitigate and manage risks. As part of its risk management practices, the Company has established a management risk committee made up of key members of the Company's management to integrate global risk activities (including cybersecurity, compliance, business and crisis management) and to ensure appropriate prioritization of resources and alignment across the Company. The Board receives regular reports on the ERM process and the Company's risk mitigation activities, including an annual report focused on information security risk. 
Compensation Risks 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee, working with its independent compensation consultant, conducted a risk assessment of our executive compensation programs. The goal of this assessment was to determine whether the general structure of our executive compensation policies and programs, annual and long-term performance goals or the administration of the programs posed any material risks to our Company. In addition, with the input of our CHRO, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation programs and policies below the executive level in a Company-wide risk assessment. The Compensation Committee shared the results of this review with our full Board. 
The Compensation Committee determined, based on the reviews of its independent compensation consultant and management's input and other factors, that the compensation policies and practices for the Company's employees in 2018, including the established performance goals and incentive plan structures, did not result in excessive risk taking or the implementation of inappropriate business decisions or strategies by the Company's executives or employees generally, and that there are no risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Related Person Transactions and Other Information 
Transactions with Related Persons 
In 2018, there were no transactions and there are no currently proposed transactions in excess of $120,000 in which the Company was or will be a participant and in which any director or executive officer of the Company, any known 5% or greater shareholder of the Company or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
24  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
Related Person Transactions Policy 
In accordance with SEC rules, our Board has adopted a written policy for the review and the approval of related person transactions. This policy is available through the Investor-Leadership & Governance-Governance link on our website, www.iff.com. Under the policy, a "related person" is specifically defined as an executive officer, a director, a director nominee, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of voting securities, an immediate family member of any of the foregoing, or a controlled entity, which is defined as an entity owned or controlled by any of the foregoing or in which any such person serves as an officer or partner, or together with all of the foregoing persons, owns 5% or more equity interests. The policy defines a "related person transaction" as a transaction or series of transactions involving a related person and the Company, excluding employment arrangements involving an executive officer or other senior officer or employee of the Company and director compensation arrangements. The policy requires that any such transaction be approved or ratified by the Nominating and Governance Committee. If accounting issues are involved in the transaction, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consult with the Audit Committee if deemed appropriate. 
Pursuant to the policy, a related person transaction will be approved or ratified only if the Nominating and Governance Committee determines that it is being entered into in good faith and on fair and reasonable terms which are in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the following factors, to the extent relevant: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the related person's relationship to the Company and interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the material facts of the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the benefits to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the availability of alternate sources of comparable products or services and the terms of such alternative; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an assessment as to whether the transaction is on terms comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third  party or to employees generally.  
[END TABLE]
No related person may participate in the review of a transaction in which he or she may have an interest. In addition, except for non-discretionary contributions made pursuant to our matching contributions program, a charitable contribution by our Company to an organization in which a related person is known to be an officer, director or trustee, is subject to approval by the Nominating and Governance Committee. In 2018, there were no related person transactions presented under the policy. 
Share Retention Policy 
We encourage our executives and directors to own our common stock so that they share the same long-term investment risk as our shareholders. Our Share Retention Policy provides executives and directors flexibility in personal financial planning, yet requires them to maintain ongoing and substantial investment in our common stock. 
Under our Share Retention Policy, each executive and director must retain shares of Company common stock at a targeted ownership level. There is no deadline by which an executive or director must meet his or her targeted ownership level. The targeted ownership level for directors is five times the cash portion of the annual retainer (not including any retainer for service as a committee chairperson or lead director). The targeted ownership levels for executives are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the lesser of shares equal in value to five times base salary or 120,000 shares for our CEO,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the lesser of shares equal in value to three times base salary or 35,000 shares for our CFO and Divisional Chief  Executive Officers, and  
[END TABLE]
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  25 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the lesser of shares equal in value to two times base salary or 20,000 shares for certain other executives,  including our General Counsel.  
[END TABLE]
If an executive or director does not meet the targeted ownership level, the executive or director may not sell or transfer any shares held in an equity, a deferred compensation or a retirement plan account provided by the Company, and the executive or director must retain such shares in such accounts until the targeted ownership level is met. For executives, if their retention requirement is not met, the executive is required to retain a portion of any shares of common stock acquired as a result of exercising any stock settled appreciation right ("SSAR") or as a result of the vesting of restricted stock or a restricted stock unit ("RSU") (after payment of any exercise price and taxes). 
As of March 6, 2019, all of our named executive officers and directors were in compliance with our Share Retention Policy. Additional detail regarding ownership of our common stock by our executive officers and directors is included in this proxy statement under the heading "Securities Ownership of Management, Directors and Certain Other Persons." 
Equity Grant Policy 
The Compensation Committee has adopted an Equity Grant Policy with respect to the issuance of equity awards under our equity plans. Under the Equity Grant Policy, the Compensation Committee approves all equity awards to our executive officers (other than our CEO) and certain other members of senior management, and our Board approves all equity awards to our CEO and to our non-employee directors. The grant date for annual awards to all employees and for annual awards to our non-employee directors is the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The grant date for awards under our Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") is the date that the Compensation Committee (or Board in the case of our CEO) approves the applicable LTIP metrics. In addition to the annual grants, equity awards may be granted "off-cycle" at other times during the year to new hires, for promotions, retention purposes, director appointments or other special circumstances. The grant price of equity awards (other than LTIP awards) is the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant or, if the grant date is not a business day, the closing price on the NYSE on the following business day. The grant price for LTIP awards is the trailing twenty-day average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE as of the first trading day of the applicable LTIP performance cycle. 
Policy Regarding Derivatives, Short Sales, Hedging and Pledges 
Under our insider trading policy, directors and all employees, including our named executive officers, are prohibited from entering into transactions designed to hedge against economic risks associated with an investment in our common stock. These individuals may not trade in derivatives in our securities (such as put and call options), effect "short sales" of our common stock, or enter into monetization transactions or similar arrangements (such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars or exchange funds) relating to our securities. These individuals are also prohibited from holding shares of our common stock in margin accounts or pledging shares of our common stock as collateral for a loan.

Directors Compensation 
Director Compensation Program 
Annual Director Cash and Equity Compensation 
Under our non-employee director compensation program, for the service year from the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting") to the 2019 Annual Meeting, each non-employee director received an annual retainer of $235,000, of which $112,500 was paid in cash and $122,500 was paid in RSUs issued under our 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan ("2015 SAIP") on the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting. These RSUs vest one year from the grant date and are subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control. The 874 RSUs granted to each director on the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting was calculated using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. Any director who is an employee of our Company does not receive any additional compensation for his or her service as a director. 
Compensation for our Lead Director and Committee Chairs 
For the service year from the 2018 Annual Meeting to the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Lead Director received an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000, the Chair of the Audit Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $17,500, the Chair of the Compensation Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $15,000 and the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee received an additional annual cash retainer of $12,500. 
Participation in our Deferred Compensation Plan 
Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"). A non- employee director may defer all or a portion of his or her cash compensation as well as any RSUs granted to him or her, subject to tax law requirements. Additional details regarding our DCP may be found in this proxy statement under the heading "Executive Compensation—Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation." Non-employee directors are not entitled to matching contributions or the 25% premium on deferrals into our common stock fund that are applicable to employees under the DCP. 
Additional Benefits 
We reimburse our non-employee directors for travel and lodging expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at Board and Committee meetings, our shareholder meetings and other Company-related activities. In addition, our current directors are eligible to participate in our Matching Gift Program. Under this program, we match, on a dollar for dollar basis, contributions made by directors to qualifying charitable organizations up to a maximum of $10,000 per person per year. 
Changes for 2019 
In October 2018, our Board approved changes to our non-employee director compensation program for the service year beginning with the 2019 Annual Meeting. Beginning in 2019, the annual retainer paid to our non-employee directors will be increased to $250,000, of which $112,500 will be paid in cash and $137,500 will be paid in RSUs. In addition, the annual retainer for each of the Chair of the Audit Committee, Chair of the Compensation Committee and Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee will be increased to $20,000, $17,500 and $15,000, respectively, and the annual retainer for the Lead Director will be increased to $25,000.

Proposal 2 Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Selection of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of our Board is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. To execute this responsibility, the Audit Committee engages in a comprehensive annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence to determine whether the independent registered public accounting firm should be rotated, and considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and our Board has directed that our management submit that selection for ratification by our shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting. PwC has been retained as our external auditor continuously since 1957. In connection with the selection of PwC, the Audit Committee annually reviews and negotiates the terms of the engagement letter entered into with PwC. This letter sets forth important terms regarding the scope of the engagement, associated fees, payment terms, responsibilities of each party and the election of the parties to be subject to binding arbitration in the case of any dispute. 
In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide audit service to our Company. For lead and quality review audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of our lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Audit Committee and management. 
The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, and we are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although ratification is not required by our By-Laws or otherwise, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our shareholders for ratification because we value our shareholders' views on our Company's independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate governance. The Audit Committee will consider the outcome of our shareholders' vote in connection with the Audit Committee's selection of our independent registered public accounting firm in the next fiscal year, but is not bound by the shareholders' vote. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that a change would be in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, where they will be available to respond to questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.

34  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
 accounting firm to our Company by category, including audit-related services, tax services and other permitted non-audit services. Under the policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves all services obtained from our independent registered public accounting firm by category of service, including a review of specific services to be performed, fees expected to be incurred within each category of service and the potential impact of such services on auditor independence. The term of any pre-approval is for the financial year, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period in the pre-approval. If it becomes necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval, the Audit Committee requires separate pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. To facilitate the process, the policy delegates pre-approval authority to the Audit Committee chairperson to pre-approve services up to $20,000, and the Audit Committee may also delegate authority to one or more of its members to pre-approve services. The Audit Committee member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
All services rendered by PwC to our Company are permissible under applicable laws and regulations. During 2018, all services performed by PwC which were subject to the SEC's pre-approval requirements were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy in effect during 2018. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee ("we," "us" or the "Committee") operates in accordance with a written charter, which was adopted by the Board. A copy of that charter is available through the Investor—Leadership & Governance—Governance link on the Company's website at www.iff.com. The Committee is composed of four directors whom the Board has determined are "independent," as required by the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the rules of the SEC, and whom qualify as "audit committee financial experts" as defined by the rules of the SEC. 
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), is responsible for performing an integrated audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). 
The Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process and internal control structure on behalf of the Board. We met eight times during 2018, including meeting regularly with PwC and the Company's internal auditor, both privately and with management present. For 2018, we have reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management. We have reviewed and discussed with management its process for preparing its report on its assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and at regular intervals we received updates on the status of this process and actions taken by management to respond to issues and deficiencies identified. We discussed with PwC its audit of the financial statements and of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. We discussed with PwC and the Company's internal auditor the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. 
We have discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. We also received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with PwC its independence. We concluded that PwC's independence was not adversely affected by the non-audit services provided by PwC, the majority of which consisted of audit-related, tax compliance and other tax services arising from our acquisition of Frutarom. 
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  35 
 PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, we recommended to the Board (and the Board subsequently approved our recommendation) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019. 
In determining whether to retain PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, we took into consideration a number of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality and effectiveness of PwC's historical and recent performance on the Company's audit;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the length of PwC's tenure as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and its  familiarity with our business, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's capability, understanding and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our global  operations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appropriateness of PwC's fees and payment terms; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this evaluation, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to retain PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, which the shareholders will be asked to ratify at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

This CD&A is organized as follows:

As discussed in Proposal 3, we are conducting our annual Say on Pay vote that requests your approval of the compensation of our NEOs as described in this section and in the tables and accompanying narrative contained below under "Executive Compensation." To assist you with this vote, please review our compensation philosophy, the design of our executive compensation programs and how, we believe, these programs have contributed to and are aligned with our performance. 
2018 was a transformative year for our Company as we completed the acquisition of Frutarom, becoming a global leader in taste, scent and nutrition. Our acquisition of Frutarom expands our customer base and product offerings, and we believe will accelerate our financial performance. Because the Frutarom acquisition was not completed until the fourth quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") did not factor the Frutarom acquisition into the 2018 compensation program. Therefore, the 2018 compensation program for our NEOs does not include Frutarom results. 
As discussed above, our product offerings have extended beyond our legacy Flavors and Fragrances businesses, therefore, during the fourth quarter of 2018 we renamed our business segments from Flavors to Taste and from Fragrances to Scent, and added Frutarom as a third business segment. 
Executive Summary 
For 2018, our NEOs were:

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
Compensation Philosophy 
The core of our executive compensation philosophy is that our executives' compensation should be linked to achievement of financial and operating performance metrics that build shareholder value over both the short- and long-term. As such, we consistently focus on the following key drivers of shareholder value maximization: 
Acquisitions Financial Results Return of Capital Increase Shareholder Value 
We designed our compensation program to focus on elements that we believe will contribute to these shareholder value drivers. Our compensation program: 
Is Variable and Tied to Value Creating Performance Metrics Reflects Each Executive's Level of Responsibility Shareholder Value Includes a Significant Equity Component Rewards Individual Performance and Contributions 
38  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
The design of our executive compensation program reflects our belief that executive compensation should be (1) aligned with the achievement of financial and operational metrics for both our Company and the respective business function in which the executive serves and (2) tied to the total shareholder return delivered to our shareholders. The following illustrates how our CEO's and other NEOs' total direct compensation is designed to tie a significant portion of their compensation to variable and long-term goals: 
CEO Target Opportunity Mix 17% Fixed 83% Variable 24% Variable Short-Term 76% Variable Long-Term 25% Long-Term Cash 75% Long-Term Equity 
NEO Average (excluding CEO) Target Opportunity Mix 29% Fixed 71% Variable 30% Variable Short-Term 70% Variable Long-Term 23% Long-Term Cash 77% Long-Term Equity 
Our 2018 NEO Compensation Reflects Our 2018 Performance 
We achieved strong results in 2018, delivering on all our key financial metrics and completing our acquisition of Frutarom. In 2018, sales were $4.0 billion, including sales related to the Frutarom acquisition, adjusted operating profit was $677 million and adjusted earnings per share was $5.58. As a result of our financial and operational results, (1) our Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") achievement levels were approximately 101.7% for those executive officers evaluated at the corporate level, 66.9% for our Divisional CEO, Scent, and 113.9% for our Divisional CEO, Taste, and (2) our 2016-2018 LTIP payout was approximately 79.1% of target. 
In addition to our successful completion of the Frutarom transaction, during 2018, we made significant progress on our strategic objectives, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Launched EcoEffective+, a set of environmental sustainability goals focused on emission reductions, zero waste to  landfill and water stewardship;

During 2018, we paid $230 million in dividends to our shareholders, increased our quarterly dividend by 6% to $0.73 per share in August, and, before suspending our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition of Frutarom, we repurchased approximately 108,000 shares of common stock for approximately $15.5 million. 
Compensation Governance 
To ensure continued alignment of compensation with Company performance and the creation of shareholder value on a long-term, sustainable basis, we maintain strong compensation-related corporate governance policies.

2018 Compensation Elements and Targeted Mix 
Our executive compensation program includes direct and indirect compensation elements. 
We believe that direct compensation should be the principal form of compensation. The table below provides a brief description of the principal elements of direct compensation, whether such compensation is fixed or variable, and the compensation program objectives served by each element. From time to time, the Committee may also approve discretionary awards to executives in connection with their initial employment or for extraordinary individual performance, a significant contribution to the Company's strategic objectives or retention purposes.

2018 Compensation 
Salaries 
The Committee reviews the salaries of our NEOs annually, and adjusts salaries periodically. In February 2018, the Committee reviewed the base salaries of our NEOs after consultation with its independent compensation consultant, and effective April 1, 2018, approved salary increases for all NEOs except our CEO, ranging between 2% and 3% to maintain market competitive target total annual compensation levels. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
During 2018, our AIP compensated our executive officers based on the achievement of certain levels of Company financial performance. Financial performance metrics are measured (1) at the consolidated corporate level for our CEO, CFO, and General Counsel and (2) at both the consolidated corporate level and the business unit level for the Divisional CEO, Scent and Divisional CEO, Taste. 
In February 2018, the Committee approved certain changes to the AIP to better align corporate and business unit metrics. For NEOs that are evaluated solely on corporate performance, the 2018 AIP weightings were adjusted to reduce the currency neutral sales growth component from 35% to 30% and increase the working capital component from 15% to 20%. For our NEOs that are evaluated on a combination of business unit and corporate performance, the corporate components now constitute 20% of the overall weighting and the business unit components constitute 80% of the overall weighting. The Committee believes that these changes reflect our focus on profitable growth. In addition, if our Company does not meet the corporate operating profit threshold, then no AIP payouts will be awarded to any participant, including the NEOs. 
The performance metrics for the 2018 AIP and their assigned weightings were as follows:

Performance Metrics and Capped AIP Payouts: Based on a review of the annual and long-term financial goals, operational plans, strategic initiatives and the prior year's actual results, the Committee annually sets the financial performance metrics for our Company and the respective business units that it will use to measure performance as well as the relative weighting that will be assigned to each metric. The Committee then approves threshold, target and maximum performance levels for each performance metric. Upon achievement of the relative performance level, an executive has the opportunity to earn threshold (25%), target (100%) and maximum (200%) amounts with performance levels achievements in between calculated on a linear basis. The Committee seeks to establish corporate performance goals that are challenging yet attainable. 
As discussed above, for 2018 AIP awards, the Committee approved the following four financial performance metrics for the reasons noted below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Currency neutral sales growth       Reflects both increases in market share and sales expansion, which drives increases in gross  profit. By measuring achievement exclusive of currency fluctuations, this goal helps to ensure that we are rewarding actual incremental growth. 
Operating profit       An increase in  operating profit (in dollar terms) encourages the management of gross profit dollars against operating expenses. Achieving this goal helps provide us with the funding to reinvest in the business to drive future growth. 
Gross margin percentage       Improvement in  gross margin percentage is an important measure of our ability to effectively recover increases in the cost of raw materials, cost discipline and operating efficiencies.     Gross margin also promotes greater focus on R&D and innovation.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
Determination of 2018 Performance Levels: In determining our 2018 AIP performance threshold, target and maximum levels, the Committee considered our annual targets for 2018, 2017 actual results and payout trends over the prior three-year and five-year periods. The performance target levels for the financial metrics were set in line with our 2018 budget. 
2018 Corporate and Business Unit AIP Performance: Our actual performance against our 2018 AIP corporate financial metrics is set forth in the tables below. In establishing AIP financial performance metrics we took into consideration certain non-operational metrics known to us at the time. In determining actual achievement against those performance metrics, we eliminated the net impact of certain non-core expenses and non-core gains to reflect our fundamental operating results. 2018 LTIP and AIP target performance levels and actual achievement against the target performance levels excluded costs or income associated with (1) adjustments related to operational improvement initiative costs and restructuring charges, (2) the Frutarom acquisition, including unbudgeted operating profit resulting from the inclusion of Frutarom results in the fourth quarter of 2018 and, legal, accounting, consulting and integration expenses, (3) other non-Frutarom acquisition related items, including integration costs, (4) an FDA mandated recall, (5) adjustments due to hyper inflationary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary, (6) the impact of the BASF supply disruption, (7) gains and sales of assets, (8) unbudgeted mark-to-market adjustments related to our Deferred Compensation Plan, and (is) solely with respect to LTIP, charges associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (together, the "2018 non-core items"). Similarly, we excluded the effects of incentive compensation provisions in calculating gross margin performance in order to better focus on the underlying operating performance of our product portfolio. The Committee believes that the necessary self-funding of incentive compensation payments is covered in the operating profit component of the AIP program.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
We believe that LTIP awards reward our executive officers, including our NEOs, for financial results and align their interests with the interests of our shareholders. Annually, the Committee reviews the LTIP to determine (1) the metrics that should be used to encourage long-term success, (2) the weightings that should be applied to such metrics and (3) the annual and cumulative targets for such metrics. The Committee believes that commencing a new three-year LTIP cycle each year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provides a regular opportunity to re-evaluate long-term metrics,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• aligns goals with the ongoing strategic planning process, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reflects our evolving business priorities and market factors.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee also annually sets a total LTIP target award for each NEO, which reflects the total LTIP award an NEO has the opportunity to receive at the end of the three-year cycle if we meet all of our targets. Depending upon our actual performance relative to financial and relative total shareholder return goals, the actual payout to the NEO could be greater or less than the total LTIP target award. 
Performance Segments.  Given the difficulty in setting long-term goals in the current volatile global economic environments, for 2018 the Committee decided that the LTIP should continue to comprise four performance segments: Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 (each an "annual performance segment") and cumulative performance over the three-year period (the "cumulative performance segment"). 
Performance Metrics.  For 2018, each annual performance segment is measured against Economic Profit ("EP") (12.5%) and the cumulative performance segment is measured against Relative TSR (62.5%). The Committee believes that a LTIP consisting of annual performance segments based on EP and a cumulative performance segment based on Relative TSR better aligns its compensation objectives with the interests of our shareholders and our focus on long-term growth initiatives. As described below in "2019 Compensation Actions," for the 2019-2021 LTIP Cycle, annual EP Performance segments will be replaced by a cumulative, three-year net debt ratio to EBITDA ratio performance metric.

For 2018, the Committee determined that EP was a factor in identifying the sources and drivers of value across our businesses and that EP growth is closely linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value. EP measures operating profitability after considering (1) all our revenues and operating costs, (2) income

 taxes and (3) a charge for the capital employed in the business. Capital employed primarily consists of working capital, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. The capital charge is determined by applying the estimated weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") to the adjusted average invested capital employed (including charges and/or loss provisions associated with non-operating events such as restructurings and tax or litigation settlements) during the relevant period. The estimated WACC rate is the weighted average cost of our debt and equity capital. In determining the EP target for the 2018 annual performance segments of the current LTIP cycles, the Committee considered our annual targets for 2018, our 2017 actual results and payout trends over the prior three-year and five-year periods, and the pro-forma impact of recent acquisitions. During 2018, our EP goal for the annual performance segments was set at the beginning of each annual performance segment. While the Committee continues to believe that EP is an important metric, in light of the Frutarom acquisition and the company-wide focus on deleveraging by 2021, the Committee decided to replace the three annual EP performance segments with a cumulative three-year performance metric of net debt to EBITDA ratio in addition to the cumulative, three-year Relative TSR for the cumulative segment, which will be weighted equally. 
For 2018, the Committee also decided that three-year Relative TSR is a good indicator of our overall long-term performance, and directly ties our executives' compensation opportunity to our share price appreciation and dividend payments relative to a major large-cap index. Relative TSR is calculated by measuring the change in the market price of stock plus dividends paid (assuming the dividends are reinvested) for our Company and the S&P 500 companies over the three-year performance period. The market price for purposes of calculating the Relative TSR of our Company and the S&P 500 on each cycle-end date is determined based on the average closing price per share of each company's stock over the period of 20 consecutive trading days preceding that date, as reported by S&P Capital IQ. The Relative TSR goal for the cumulative performance segment is set at the beginning of the three-year cycle. 
At the end of each year, the Committee reviews our annual performance and cumulative performance for the newly completed three-year cycle. To the extent that our annual performance has met or exceeded the threshold annual EP goal, the Committee approves "banking" the credit that will be applied to the payout at the end of the three-year cycle. For the completed three-year cycle, the Committee approves the total payout, taking into consideration the performance for each of the prior annual performance segments and the cumulative performance segment. 
2018-2020 LTIP Target Awards 
In early 2018, the Committee approved the following total LTIP target awards to each of our NEOs for the 2018-2020 LTIP cycle:

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
 shares is determined based on the market price of the common stock at the beginning of the cycle. For the 2018-2020 LTIP cycle, it was based on $153.26 per share, the average closing price for the twenty trading days prior to January 2, 2018, the first stock trading day of the cycle. At the conclusion of each of the first two annual performance segments, the dollar value and number of shares will be "banked" based on the performance of each such segment. When the three-year cycle is concluded and the Committee approves the LTIP payout, the cumulative dollar value and cumulative number of shares are paid to the executive. 
2018 LTIP Performance 
For the 2018 segment of each of the existing LTIP cycles, our EP of $252 million, as adjusted for 2018 non-core items, was between target and maximum performance level. As a result, our NEOs earned 190.6% of the annual target based on the EP goal for the year. Our Relative TSR for the cumulative, three-year performance period ended in 2018 was between threshold and target and, as a result, our NEOs earned 43.8% of target based on the Relative TSR goal for the three-year cycle. The LTIP award earned and "banked" for the 2018 segments of the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 LTIP cycles was equal to approximately 23.8%. 
2018 LTIP Results

2016-2018 LTIP Payout 
The 2018 segment was 190.6% of target based on the annual 2018 EP goal (resulting in a segment weighting of 23.8%) and the Cumulative TSR result was 43.8% of target on the cumulative, three-year Relative TSR goal (resulting in a segment weighting of 27.3%). Consequently, the overall payout for the 2016-2018 LTIP cycle was approximately 79.1% of target, based on the following EP and Relative TSR results against objectives, as determined by the Committee.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
The payout for the 2016-2018 LTIP cycle for the NEOs, based on the actual achievement of quantitative objectives, is discussed in greater detail following the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 
For the LTIP performance cycles that concluded in the five-year period from 2014 to 2018, the actual overall corporate percentage payout under the LTIP against those long-term cycle performance goals ranged from approximately 79.1% to 146.4%, with an average payout of 119.8%. 
Equity Choice Program 
Equity is a key component of our long-term incentive compensation as it (1) provides participants with a meaningful stake in our Company, thereby aligning their interests more closely with shareholders, (2) encourages participants to focus on long-term success, (3) helps to attract and retain top talent and (4) recognizes individual contributions. We believe that our ECP is an effective vehicle to encourage ownership as it provides participants the flexibility to allocate their award among three types of equity. 
Under the ECP, participants, including all of our NEOs, may choose from three types of equity award grants. For ECP awards in 2018, these three types were (1) Purchased Restricted Stock Units ("PRSUs"), (2) Stock-Settled Appreciation Rights ("SSARs"), and (3) Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). PRSUs are assigned an adjustment factor of 120% to provide incentive to participants to invest in and accumulate shares to promote retention and increase alignment of participants' interests with those of our shareholders. Elections are made in 5% increments. Based on the participant's election, a participant's dollar award value is converted into PRSUs, SSARs or RSUs on the grant date based on the market price of our common stock on such date. 
All ECP awards are generally subject to a vesting period of approximately three years. The Committee believes the ECP is an attractive tool for recruiting, motivating and retaining executive talent and encourages alignment with shareholders by reinforcing investment and ownership in our Company by our executives. 
50  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
The table below sets forth each of the three types of equity awards offered and their adjustment factor. During 2018, ECP participants, including all of our NEOs, made choices based on the different equity award types described below.

   PRSUs      PRSUs are restricted stock units that are granted as a match against shares of Company stock purchased at full value by an ECP participant on the grant date.  As an incentive to promote share accumulation and direct investment in our stock, there is a 20% adjustment upward of the award value if PRSUs are elected. If an ECP participant chooses PRSUs, then he or she must deliver funds (or shares with an  equivalent value) equal to the dollar amount of the ECP award (including the 20% adjustment). Upon receipt of the funds by the Company, the ECP participant receives a matching number of PRSUs.   PRSU holders have no voting rights during the vesting period but accrue dividend  equivalents on their PRSUs. PRSUs vest approximately three years from the date of grant. PRSUs are the most rapid way for participants to accumulate and build share ownership based on the participant's direct investment in Company stock.

Participants receive a number of SSARs equivalent to 5 times (i.e. the approximate binomial value of the SSARs) the elected SSAR award value divided by the grant price. SSARs provide upside potential for share  accumulation and greater alignment with shareholders because SSARS only have value if the stock price increases after the grant date.   SSARs become exercisable on a stated vesting date, which is approximately three years from the grant date, and expire on the seventh anniversary of the grant  date. SSARs do not require a financial investment by the SSAR grantee.

2018 Equity Choice Program Awards 
The Committee annually determines the dollar range of ECP awards for each level of participating executive based on peer group and long-term incentive practices survey data, a review of the competitiveness of the combined value of the ECP awards and LTIP awards with market practices and other factors that it deems appropriate. For 2018, these ranges were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO    $     1,000,000            $      3,500,000     
 Divisional CEOs and CFO    $      250,000              $       750,000       
   General Counsel       $         175,000                    $       525,000

[END TABLE]
The Committee then approves the actual dollar award to be granted to each NEO other than the CEO, and recommends to the independent members of the Board for approval the actual dollar award for the CEO. 
In February 2018, the Committee approved the 2018 ECP values awarded to each executive, including our NEOs, with an effective grant date of May 2, 2018. The period of time between approval of ECP values and the actual grant date gives ECP participants time to make their irrevocable ECP elections and to arrange for the purchase of shares from the Company if PRSUs are elected. The Committee determined that the 2018 ECP grants would vest on April 2, 2021 (35 months from the grant date). 
Similar to prior years, the actual amount of each ECP awarded to each NEO in 2018 was based on an evaluation of the NEO's individual performance, long-term potential, market factors and retention considerations. The actual value of these awards will depend on future stock price performance. 
The following table shows the ECP dollar award value approved by the Committee or Board for each NEO during 2018 and the percentage and adjusted dollar value after application of the adjustment factor of each type of award elected by each NEO.

2018 Retention Award 
In September 2018, the Committee granted Mr. Haeni a special retention award of 14,544 RSUs, with 9,454 RSUs vesting on December 31, 2019 and 5,090 RSUs vesting on December 31, 2020, subject to his continued employment as of such vesting dates. 
Indirect Compensation 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
As part of our compensation program, we offer U.S.-based executives and other senior employees an opportunity to participate in our DCP. Pursuant to the terms of the DCP, we provide the same level of matching contributions to our executives that are available to other employees under our 401(k) savings plan. We also use the DCP to encourage executives to acquire shares of our common stock that are economically equivalent to ownership of our common stock but on a tax-deferred basis. We do this to encourage executives to be long-term owners of a significant equity stake in our Company and to enhance the alignment between the interests of executives and those of our shareholders. 
Our costs in offering the DCP consist of the time-value of money costs, the cost of the matching contribution that supplements the 401(k) savings plan, administrative costs and a 25% premium for amounts deferred into the IFF Stock Fund in an executive's DCP account. The premium on amounts deferred into the IFF Stock Fund typically do not vest until approximately two years after the deferral is made, as the premium is contingent on the executive remaining employed by us (other than for retirement) for the full calendar year following the year when such deferral is made. If notional investments within the DCP increase in value, the amount of our payment obligation will increase. The time-value of money cost results from the delay in the time at which we can take tax deductions for compensation payable to a participating executive. 
Additional information about the DCP and supplemental matching contributions and premiums on cash deferrals into the IFF Stock fund under the DCP made for NEOs may be found below under "2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation." 
Executive Severance Policy 
The ESP provides severance and other benefits to executives, including NEOs, whose employment is terminated by the Company without cause or in the event of a termination by the executive for good reason in certain circumstances. This policy helps us in competing with other companies in recruiting and retaining qualified executives. When recruiting an executive from another company, the executive in most cases will seek contract terms that provide compensation if his or her employment is terminated in cases in which the executive has not engaged in misconduct. The level of severance pay under the ESP is based on a tier system and each executive's assigned tier is based on the executive's grade level. All of our NEOs are in Tier I. We believe that the ESP provides a level of severance pay and benefits that is competitive with our peer group companies. 
A discussion of our ESP and the payments that each of our NEOs would have been eligible to receive had a covered termination occurred as of December 31, 2018 is set forth below under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Additional Benefits 
Perquisite Program 
Our NEO perquisite program offers non-monetary benefits that are within the range of market practice as determined through a market study conducted by our independent compensation consultant. The Committee reviews our perquisite program on a bi-annual basis with its independent compensation consultant. Based on its last review, the Committee determined that the total value of our perquisite

 program is within the range of market practice. Additional details concerning perquisites are included in the footnotes to the All Other Compensation Table. 
Under the perquisite program, our NEOs participate in our health and welfare benefits that are generally available to all employees, including group medical insurance, group life insurance, and group long-term disability insurance. In addition, our NEOs are generally eligible to receive certain benefits including:

We may provide additional or modified perquisites to our NEOs in connection with their employment arrangements. In addition, Mr. Fibig is provided a Company driver, and an annual financial planning and tax preparation allowance of $25,000. 
Supplemental Long-Term Disability 
In addition to our group long-term disability ("LTD") insurance, we also offer Supplemental LTD insurance to those U.S.-based employees, including our NEOs, who earn a base salary plus bonus in excess of the maximum base salary of $300,000 under our group plan. The Supplemental LTD insurance provides a maximum monthly benefit of $25,000. The Supplemental LTD insurance premium, like our basic group LTD policy, is fully paid by us and is taxable income to employees upon receipt of the benefit. 
Executive Death Benefit Plan 
Our Executive Death Benefit Plan provides participants, including each of the NEOs, with a pre-retirement death benefit equal to twice the participant's annual base salary less $50,000 (the death benefit provided by our basic group term life insurance plan for employees and retirees). The plan also provides a death benefit post-retirement, or pre-retirement after attaining age 70, equal to the participant's base salary for the year in which the participant retires or reaches the age of 70, assuming the participant was an executive officer, less $12,500 of group coverage for retired participants and less $50,000 for senior participants (those who have attained the age of 70 and remain employed with us).

The Committee recommends CEO compensation to the independent directors of the Board for their approval and  approves the compensation of all other NEOs.   
 Compensation Consultant        Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc.  ("FW Cook") is engaged as the Committee's independent compensation consultant. Since August 2015, FW Cook has worked with the Committee to provide it with analyses, advice, guidance and recommendations on executive compensation levels  versus peers, market trends and incentive plan designs. FW Cook is engaged exclusively by the Committee on executive and non-employee director compensation matters and does not have other consulting  arrangements with us. The Committee considers the independence of FW Cook on an annual basis, and in 2018 it determined FW Cook was independent and that no conflicts of interest existed.   
 Management        Our CEO evaluates individual performance  and, with input from the Committee's independent compensation consultant, the CEO and CHRO evaluate the competitive pay positioning for senior management members that report directly to the CEO, including our NEOs, and make recommendations to  the Committee concerning each such executive's target compensation.

[END TABLE]
As part of its compensation setting process, the Committee also considers the results of the prior year's shareholder advisory vote on our executive compensation. The Committee believes these voting results provide useful insight as to whether shareholders agree that the Committee is achieving its goal of designing and administering an executive compensation program that promotes the best interests of our Company and our shareholders by providing its executives with appropriate compensation and meaningful incentives to deliver strong financial performance and increase shareholder value. As part of its 2018 compensation setting process, the Committee reviewed the results of the 2017 shareholder advisory vote, in which 93.1% of the votes cast were voted in favor of our executive compensation program. 
Peer Group and Benchmarking 
On an annual basis, the Committee reviews and approves the compensation of our NEOs. We use a global grading structure for our NEOs, with compensation ranges for each grade. Our NEOs are placed in a particular grade based on internal factors (including scope of responsibilities and job complexity) and an

 external market evaluation. The external market evaluation is based on published third-party general survey information and a review of similar positions within our selected peer groups described below. This process is referred to as "market benchmarking." 
Market Benchmarking 
The Committee reviews its external market benchmarking and peer group data annually. The Committee's goals are to position (1) target total cash compensation at median or slightly above and (2) target total direct compensation (salary, annual incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation) between the median to 75th percentile of relevant market benchmarks. This philosophy reflects the Committee's approach to setting stretch goals that require above median performance to generate target payouts. In July 2017, the Committee reviewed peer group data with our independent compensation consultant for purposes of determining the appropriate peer group for setting 2018 compensation levels and opportunities. 
The Committee's independent compensation consultant provides the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile "market reference" data for each executive position based on the average of the three relevant compensation benchmarks, as further explained below. This data is used to analyze the external competitiveness of each NEO's base salary, target total cash compensation and target total direct compensation. This analysis is reviewed with the Committee and, in the case of the compensation of NEOs other than the CEO, with the CEO as well. In determining target total direct compensation for each executive in 2018, the Committee considered the consultant's market reference analysis. In addition, the Committee considered a number of other important factors, including each executive's:

The Committee uses the market reference range in order to establish a starting point for the compensation levels that the Committee believes would provide our NEOs with competitive compensation. However, the actual target total direct compensation approved by the Committee may be above or below the market reference range based on the Committee's review of market compensation levels, its desire to create internal pay equity among our executives and the individual factors set forth above. 
For 2018, the Committee awarded target total direct compensation to our NEOs that was within the competitive range of the targeted median to 75th percentile. The total actual compensation paid for the year, as compared to target compensation approved at the beginning of the year, may differ depending on Company and individual performance. Consequently, the actual compensation received by an NEO may be higher or lower than his or her market reference range.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
For 2018 compensation decisions regarding our NEOs, the Committee benchmarked compensation of our NEOs (other than our General Counsel) against our Peer Group and a size appropriate cut of the 2017 Towers Watson General Industry Survey and the compensation of our General Counsel against a size appropriate cut of the 2017 Towers Watson General Industry Survey and a size appropriate cut of food, beverage and other consumer products companies included in the 2017 Towers Watson Industry Survey (the "Consumer Products / Food & Beverage Select Cut"). Information about these benchmarking groups is set forth below.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Changes to 2019 Selected Peer Group 
In August 2018, the Committee reviewed with its independent compensation consultant the selected peer group for purposes of the upcoming 2019 target compensation setting process. In light of the acquisition of Frutarom, the Committee wanted to ensure that companies in the selected peer group remained reasonable relative to the increased size of the Company following the completion of the acquisition, and that the selected peer group as a whole would continue to be representative of the market for executive talent with reasonable overlap in key areas of business focus. As a result of this review, the Committee approved the following changes to the peer group for purposes of the 2019 target compensation setting process: (i) each of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, Revlon, Inc., Sensient Technologies Corporation and Tupperware Brands Corporation were removed from the peer group; and (ii) each of Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Celanese Corporation, Perrigo Company plc and Post Holdings, Inc. were added to the peer group. 
Clawback Policy 
All compensation under our 2010 Stock Award and Incentive Plan and our 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, including AIP, LTIP, ECP and other cash and equity awards, as well as payments made under our ESP, are subject to clawback. 
The triggers for recovery of compensation under our compensation recoupment and clawback policies include:

Tax Deductibility 
Prior to the effectiveness of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") imposed an annual deduction limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation paid to each of the chief executive officer and certain other named executive officers. The deduction limit did not apply to performance-based compensation satisfying the requirements of Section 162(m). Effective in fiscal year 2018, the Tax Act eliminated the Section 162(m) provisions exempting performance-based compensation from the $1 million deduction limit. While the Committee will continue to take into account the tax and accounting implications (including with respect to the expected lack of deductibility under the revised Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions, it reserves the right to make compensation decisions based on other factors if the Committee determines it is in its best interests to do so. Further, taking into account the elimination of the exemption for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), the Committee may determine to make changes or amendments to its existing compensation programs in order to revise aspects of our programs that were initially designed to comply with Section 162(m) but that may no longer serve as an appropriate incentive measure for our executive officers. 
58  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
2019 Compensation Actions 
In October 2018, the Company successfully completed its acquisition of Frutarom, with Frutarom now reporting as a third business segment alongside Scent and Taste. In general, for 2019, the Company expects to continue to compensate Frutarom employees consistent with the past practice of Frutarom. The Committee reviewed with its independent compensation consultant the structure of our AIP in light of the acquisition of Frutarom and, as a result of this review, approved the expansion of AIP in fiscal year 2019 to include a business segment to reward performance at Frutarom. During 2019, the President, Frutarom will be an eligible participant in the AIP. However, at this time, we do not currently anticipate that Frutarom executives will participate in our existing LTIP or ECP programs. 
The Committee, in consultation with management and FW Cook also evaluated the LTIP performance metrics for the 2019-2021 cycle in light of the Frutarom acquisition. While the Committee continues to believe that EP is an important metric, in light of the Frutarom acquisition and the company-wide focus on deleveraging by 2021, the Committee decided to replace the three annual EP performance segments with a cumulative three-year performance metric of net debt to EBITDA ratio in addition to the cumulative, three-year Relative TSR for the cumulative segment, which will be weighted equally.

This CD&A includes the following non-GAAP financial measures: currency neutral sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share. Please see Exhibit A of this proxy statement for a reconciliation of such metrics. 
Compensation Committee Report

Proposal 3 Advisory Vote on Executive CompensationProposal 3 - Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (known as the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires us to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, often referred to as "Say on Pay." 
The core of our executive compensation philosophy is that our executives' compensation should be linked to achievement of financial and operating performance metrics that build shareholder value over both the short- and long-term. We have designed our compensation program to focus on elements that we believe will contribute to these shareholder value drivers. As such, our compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• includes a significant equity component,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is variable and tied to multiple value-creating performance metrics,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reflects each executive's position, role, responsibility and experience, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• rewards individual performance and contributions toward our annual financial performance objectives.   
[END TABLE]
In 2018, 93.1% of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal relating to 2017 executive compensation voted for the proposal. In deciding how to cast your vote on this proposal, the Board requests that you consider the structure of the Company's executive compensation program, which is more fully discussed in this proxy statement under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
This vote is non-binding; however, we value the opinions of our shareholders and accordingly the Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of this advisory vote in connection with future executive compensation decisions. 
For reasons set forth above, the Board recommends that you vote for the compensation paid to the NEOs in 2018. 
Accordingly, we will ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that, the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs in 2018, as disclosed in this proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative disclosure, is hereby approved."

Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO, Andreas Fibig. 
As of December 28, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 7,647 individuals working at our parent company and consolidated subsidiaries, of which approximately 1,825 are located in the United States and 5,822 are located outside the United States. In accordance with a permitted exemption under the pay ratio rules, our employee population did not include approximately 5,570 individuals who became employees after October 4, 2018, as a result of our acquisition of Frutarom. We selected 
62  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
 December 28, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year, as the determination date for identifying the median employee. 
We previously identified our median employee as of December 29, 2017 (the last day of the 2017 fiscal year), by calculating the amount of annual target total cash compensation (salary plus target annual incentive compensation) paid to all of our employees (other than the CEO) based on the compensation information maintained in a centralized database. Since we do not widely distribute annual equity-based awards to our employees, the value of such awards was excluded from the compensation calculation used to determine the median employee. We did not make any cost-of-living or other adjustments in identifying the median employee. 
Based on this methodology, the median employee was a full-time, salaried employee in the Netherlands. As of December 28, 2018, this employee was employed in the same capacity, without any substantial salary increase, as December 29, 2017. Given our permitted exclusion of Frutarom employees, we believe there were no significant changes in our employee population and, accordingly, we reasonably believe that there have been no changes that would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. Therefore, to determine our pay ratio for 2018, we used the same median employee identified in 2017. 
We calculated the 2018 total annual compensation of such employee in accordance with the requirements of the executive compensation rules for the Summary Compensation Table (Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K). Under this calculation, the median employee's annual total compensation was $60,167 based on a Euro to US Dollar exchange rate of $1.1353 (the exchange rate as of December 28, 2018). 
Utilizing the same executive compensation rules, and consistent with the amount reported in the "Total" Column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table above for the CEO, the annual total compensation of our CEO was $8,521,940. The resulting ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 142 to 1.

Long-Term Incentive Plan 
As discussed above, LTIP cycles have four performance segments (1) one for each of the three years in the LTIP cycle and (2) the cumulative results for the full three-year LTIP cycle. Any amounts earned under a performance segment are credited on behalf of the executive at the end of the relevant segment, but such credited amounts are not paid until the completion of the three-year LTIP cycle and could be forfeited if a NEO leaves the Company prior to the payment date. As 50% of the LTIP award is payable in cash and 50% is payable in stock, (i) at the beginning of each cycle, the grant date fair market value of the 50% of the LTIP award payable in stock is included in the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table for that year and (ii) each year upon determination of the amount to be credited to the NEO for the annual segment or the cumulative segment, as the case may be, the cash portion of the NEO's credited awards is included in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table for the year in which it is earned. 
2016-2018 LTIP Payout 
The following table sets forth the total amount earned by each NEO based on achievement of the corporate performance goals for each segment under the 2016-2018 LTIP cycle and based on each executive's target amount (or reduced target amount for each NEO who was not employed in his or her current role for the entire three-year cycle). The amount reported in the "Total" column is the amount being paid out to the NEOs in 2018 following completion of the 2016-2018 LTIP cycle.

Equity Compensation Plan Information 
We currently grant equity awards under our 2015 SAIP only, which replaced our 2010 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "2010 SAIP"). The following table provides information regarding our common stock which may be issued under our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2018.

(1)  Represents outstanding under the 2015 SAIP and the 2010 SAIP. The 2015 SAIP replaced the 2010 SAIP and provides  the source for future deferrals of cash into deferred stock under the DCP (with the DCP being deemed a sub-plan under the 2015 SAIP for the sole purpose of funding deferrals under the IFF Stock Fund).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Includes RSUs, SSARs, the number of shares to be issued under the 2016-2018 LTIP cycle based on actual  performance, and the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 LTIP cycles if the performance conditions for each of those cycles are satisfied at the maximum level. The number of SSARs that may be issued upon  exercise was calculated by dividing (i) the product of (a) the excess of the closing market price of our common stock on the last trading day of 2018 over the exercise price, and (b) the number of SSARs outstanding by (ii) the  closing market price on the last trading day of 2018. Excludes outstanding shares of PRS under the 2010 SAIP.

(4)  We currently have two equity compensation plans that have not been approved by our shareholders: (i) the  DCP, which is described on page 56 and (ii) a pool of shares that may be used for annual awards of 1,000 shares to each non-employee director. Although we are no longer granting these annual 1,000 share  stock awards to directors, the pool of shares remains authorized. Includes 157,240 shares remaining available for issuance under the DCP and 43,750 shares remaining available for issuance from a pool of shares that may be used for annual awards of  1,000 shares to each non-employee director.

Pension Benefits 
We provide a defined benefit pension plan (the "U.S. Pension Plan") to eligible United States-based employees hired before January 1, 2006. Of our NEOs, only Mr. Mirzayantz currently participates in the U.S. Pension Plan. U.S. employees hired on or after January 1, 2006, including all of our other NEOs, are not eligible to participate in the U.S. Pension Plan. We pay the full cost of providing benefits under the U.S. Pension Plan. 
Compensation and service earned after December 31, 2007 are not taken into account in determining an employee's benefit under the U.S. Pension Plan except for employees whose combined age and years of service equaled or exceeded 70 as of December 31, 2007. As Mr. Mirzayantz did not satisfy this requirement, Mr. Mirzayantz had his benefit frozen as of December 31, 2007. 
The monthly pension benefit is equal to the number of years of credited service as of December 31, 2007 times the difference between (a) 1.7% times final average compensation, and (b) 1.25% times the social security amount. Final average compensation for purposes of the U.S. Pension Plan is the average of the five consecutive years of compensation during the last ten years before December 31, 2007 that produce the highest average. The term "compensation" means the basic rate of monthly salary (as of April 1 each year) plus 1/12 of any AIP cash award received for the preceding year, reduced by any compensation deferred under our DCP. The normal retirement age under the U.S. Pension Plan is age 65. 
Various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC") limit the amount of compensation used in determining benefits payable under our U.S. Pension Plan. We established a non-qualified Supplemental Retirement Plan to pay that part of the pension benefit that, because of these IRC limitations, cannot be paid under the U.S. Pension Plan to our U.S. senior executives. For purposes of the Supplemental Retirement Plan, "compensation" includes any salary and AIP amounts, including amounts deferred under our DCP. 
Employees with at least 10 years of service are eligible for early retirement under the U.S. Pension Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan beginning at age 55. The benefit at early retirement is an unreduced benefit payable at age 62 or a reduced benefit (4% per year) if paid prior to age 62. 
The following table provides information for Mr. Mirzayantz regarding our U.S. Pension Plan and Supplemental Retirement Plan. The present value of accumulated benefits payable under each of our retirement plans was determined using the following assumptions: an interest rate of 4.32%; morality base table is RP-2014 (rebased to 2006) adjusted for IFF experience with MP-2018 mortality improvement projection scale; 80% of participants are married with a spouse four years younger and are receiving a 50% joint and survivor annuity and 20% of participants are unmarried and are receiving a straight life annuity with a five-year guarantee. Additional information regarding the valuation method and material assumptions used to determine the accumulated benefits reported in the table is presented in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report. The information provided in the columns other than the Payments During Last Fiscal Year column is presented as of December 31, 2018, the measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

• an interest-bearing account.  
[END TABLE]
Except for deferrals into the IFF Stock Fund, the participant may generally change his or her choice of funds at any time. For the interest-bearing account, our Compensation Committee establishes an interest rate each year which we intend to be equal to 120% of the applicable federal long-term interest rate. For 2018 this interest rate was 3.13% and for 2019 this interest rate is 3.92%. 
We make matching contributions under the DCP to make up for tax limitations on our matching contributions under our Retirement Investment Fund Plan, a 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan provides for matching contributions at a rate of $1.00 for each dollar of contribution up to 4% of a participant's salary 
74  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
 plus $0.75 for each dollar of contribution above 4% up to 8% of a participant's salary. 
Tax rules limit the amount of the Company match under the 401(k) plan for our executives. The DCP matching contribution reflects the amount of the matching contribution which is limited by the tax laws. The same requirements under the 401(k) plan for matching, including vesting, apply to matching contributions under the DCP. These matching contributions automatically vest once a participant completes three years of service with our Company. 
The DCP gives participants an incentive to defer compensation into the IFF Stock Fund by granting a 25% premium, credited in additional deferred stock, on all cash compensation deferred into the stock fund contingent upon the participant remaining employed by the Company (other than for retirement) for the full calendar year following the year when such credit was made. If the participant withdraws any deferred stock within one year of a deferral, any premium shares credited will be forfeited. Vesting of the premium deferred stock accelerates upon a change in control. RSUs granted to Directors under our equity compensation plans may also be deferred upon vesting, but no premium is added. 
The following table provides information for our NEOs regarding participation in our DCP.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
Termination and Change in Control Arrangements 
Executive Severance Policy 
Our ESP provides severance payments and benefits to our NEOs and other executives in the event of a termination of their employment in certain specified circumstances. In addition, under our incentive plans, the vesting of equity awards may also be accelerated in connection with certain terminations. The level of severance pay under the ESP is based on a tier system. Each executive's assigned tier is based on the executive's grade level. The Compensation Committee may also agree to provide enhanced severance payments and benefits to specific executives. All our NEOs are in Tier I. Mr. Fibig's offer letter has modified some of the relevant definitions, amounts and other terms regarding the benefits that he is eligible to receive under the ESP. See "Other Separation Arrangements" below for a discussion of Mr. Fibig's benefits. 
Our ESP provides for acceleration of severance payments and continuation of benefits in connection with a Tier 1 executive's termination (1) if his or her employment is terminated by us without Cause or (2) if he or she terminates his or her employment for Good Reason prior to or more than two years after a Change in Control (or "CiC"). An executive maybe able to receive enhanced benefits if separation occurs within two years of CiC, as describe below. 
Our ESP states that a "Change in Control" will be deemed to have occurred when any of the following has occurred: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 40% or more of the combined voting power of our then  outstanding voting securities, other than beneficial ownership by us, any of our employee benefit plans or any person organized, appointed or established pursuant to the terms of any such benefit plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the directors of the Board as of November 1, 2018 (the "Incumbent Directors") cease to constitute  a majority of the Board for any reason; provided, however, that (i) any individual becoming a director subsequent to November 1, 2018 whose election or nomination for election to the Board was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors then on the Board shall be an Incumbent Director and (ii) any individual initially elected or nominated as a director as a result of an actual or threatened election  contest shall not be an Incumbent Director; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of (A) a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar transaction with us or in which  our securities are issued, as a result of which the holders of our outstanding voting securities immediately before such event own, directly or indirectly, immediately after such event less than 60% of the combined voting power of the outstanding  voting securities of the parent entity resulting from, or issuing its voting securities as part of, such event; (B) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (C) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our  assets to any person, with certain exceptions.

Payment for Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason. Pursuant to our ESP, any Tier 1 executive that is terminated by us without Cause or by a Tier 1 executive for Good Reason prior to or more than two years after a CiC is entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A severance payment equal to (a) two times (2x) in case of our CEO, or (b) one and one-half times (1.5x) in case of our other Tier I executives, the sum of the executive's annual base salary at the date of termination plus the prorated portion of the executive's target AIP award for the  year in which termination occurs (payable to the executive in regular installments over 24 months for our CEO, or 18 months for other Tier I executives, following termination);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A prorated portion of the executive's target AIP award for the year in which termination occurs, payable  when such AIP amounts otherwise become payable;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A prorated portion of the executive's target LTIP award for the cycles then in progress, payable when such  LTIP amounts otherwise become payable;  
[END TABLE]

• Vesting of a prorated portion of any unvested equity award(s), settled on the applicable vesting date as if  termination had not occurred; and  
[END TABLE]

• Continuation of medical, dental, disability and life insurance coverage for 24 months for our CEO and 18 months  for our other Tier I executives, or until the executive obtains new employment providing similar benefits or attains age 65.  
[END TABLE]
Severance Payments and Benefits in Connection with a Change in Control 
Upon the occurrence of a termination of any Tier 1 executive by us without Cause or by a Tier 1 executive for Good Reason within two years following a CiC, the executive would be entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A severance payment equal to (a) three times (3x) in case of our CEO, or (b) two times (2x) in case of  our other Tier I executives, the sum of the executive's annual base salary at the date of termination plus the higher of (1) his or her average AIP award for the three most recent years and (2) his or her target AIP award for the year  in which termination occurs, payable in a lump sum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A prorated portion of the executive's target AIP award for the year in which termination occurs, payable in  a lump sum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Definitions. Our ESP defines Cause and Good Reason as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Cause" means:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     failure of the executive to perform his or her material duties in any material respect, which if reasonably  susceptible to cure, has continued after written notice of such failure has been provided and the executive has not cured such failure within 10 days of receipt of such written notice;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     willful misconduct or gross negligence by the executive that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in  material injury to our business, reputation, or prospects;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     the engagement by the executive in illegal conduct or any act of serious dishonesty which could reasonably be  expected to result in material injury to our business or reputation or which adversely affects the executives ability to perform his or her duties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     the executive being indicted or convicted of (or having pled guilty or nolo contendere to) a felony or any crime  involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, theft or financial impropriety; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     a material and willful violation by the executive of our rules, policies or procedures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Good Reason" means any of the following:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     a material decrease in the executives base salary, target bonus under an AIP, LTIP or Equity Choice Award,  other than as part of an across-the-board reduction applicable to all similarly situated employees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     a material diminution in the executives authority, duties or responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     relocation of executives primary work location more than 50 miles from executives primary work  location at the time of such requested relocation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     our failure to obtain the binding agreement of any successor expressly to assume and agree to fully perform our  obligations under the ESP.  
[END TABLE]
However, "good reason" will only exist if the executive gives us notice within 90 days after the initial occurrence of any of the foregoing events and we fail to correct the matter within 30 days following receipt of such notice. 
Tax Gross-Up. Executives are not entitled to receive a tax "gross-up" payment. Instead, their severance payments would be subject to a "modified cut-back" provision, where severance or other payments to that executive would be reduced if this reduction would produce a better after-tax result for the executive. There would be no reduction, however, if the executive (who would be responsible for any excise tax) would have a better after-tax result without the reduction. 
Participant Obligations for the Protection of Our Business and Clawback. As a condition of the executive's right to receive severance payments and benefits, the ESP requires that he or she: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not compete with us,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not solicit, induce, divert, employ, retain or interfere with or attempt to influence our relationship with any  employee or person providing services to the Company and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not interfere with or attempt to influence our relationship with any supplier, customer or other person with whom  we do business.  
[END TABLE]
78  IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
These restrictions apply while an executive is employed and following a termination of employment during the period of 12 months in case of non-compete obligations and 24 months in case of non-solicitation obligations. In addition, executives are not entitled to severance if they engage in willful misconduct or a violation of a Company policy that is materially detrimental to us while employed by the Company. The ESP also conditions severance payments and benefits on the executive signing a release and termination agreement, and meeting continuing commitments relating to confidentiality, cooperation in litigation and return of our property. 
As discussed above in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Clawback Policy," compensation received under our ESP is subject to our clawback policy if the executive breaches the obligations noted above or if any of the other events triggering a clawback, such as a financial misstatement or restatement, occur. 
Effect of IRC Section 409A. The timing of some payments and benefits may be restricted under IRC Section 409A, which regulates deferred compensation. Some amounts payable to our NEOs or other participants under the ESP upon termination may be delayed until six months after termination. 
Payments in connection with death, disability or retirement. Our executives may also receive payment if their employment terminates as a result of death, disability or retirement as set forth in the terms and conditions of their award agreements with the Company and, in the case of our CEO, his letter agreement as described below under "Other Separation Arrangements—Mr. Fibig." Our NEOs are also entitled to payments under our Executive Death Benefit Plan as described in this proxy statement under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Death Benefit Plan." In the event of disability, our NEOs would be entitled to payments under our Disability Insurance Program that applies to salaried employees generally (60% of monthly salary up to a maximum of $15,000 per month). 
Other Separation Arrangements 
Mr. Fibig 
Details regarding Mr. Fibig's letter agreement dated May 26, 2014 are included in this proxy statement under the heading "Employment Agreements or Arrangements" following the Summary Compensation Table. Under the terms of his letter agreement, Mr. Fibig is a participant in our ESP and is entitled to receive the benefits set forth above, with the following modifications: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with any termination without Cause or for Good Reason, not in connection with a CiC:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Mr. Fibigs severance payment will be a multiple of two times (2x) the sum of his annual base salary  plus the average AIP bonus paid to him in the three years prior to termination, payable over 24 months; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Mr. Fibig will be entitled to receive a prorated portion of any LTIP award that is in progress on the date  of termination, based on target, in a lump-sum cash payment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with any termination without Cause or for Good Reason that occurs within two years after a CiC, all  of Mr. Fibig's outstanding equity awards will vest in full at target;  
[END TABLE]
Any termination by us without cause (as described below) or by Mr. Fibig for any reason requires prior written notice of 90 days. Under Mr. Fibig's letter agreement, "Cause" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willful and continued failure to perform substantially his duties with the Company (other than any such failure  resulting from his incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to him by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which he has not substantially performed his duties, and  which provides a 20-day cure period;  
[END TABLE]
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  79 
 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willful engagement in conduct which is not authorized by the Board or within the normal course of his business  decisions and is known by him to be materially detrimental to our best interests or the best interests of any of our subsidiaries, including any misconduct that results in material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the  Federal securities laws if such noncompliance results in an accounting restatement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willful engagement in illegal conduct or any act of serious dishonesty which adversely affects, or in the  reasonable estimation of the Board, could in the future adversely affect his value, reliability or performance to our Company in a material manner (other than any act or failure to act based upon authority given by the Board or advice of counsel for  the Company, which shall be presumed to be done in good faith and in the best interests of the Company); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• his being indicted for or convicted of (or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to) a felony or any crime involving  moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, theft or financial impropriety.  
[END TABLE]
Under Mr. Fibig's letter agreement, "Good Reason" means any of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any reduction in his base salary or target AIP bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an adverse change in his status or position as CEO (including as a result of a material diminution in his duties  or responsibilities);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• required relocation to a principal place of employment outside of the New York City metropolitan area; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our failure to obtain an agreement from any successor to all or substantially all of our assets or business to  assume and agree to perform his Employment Agreement within 15 days after a merger, consolidation, sale or similar transaction.  
[END TABLE]
However, "Good Reason" will only exist if the CEO resigns from employment within 180 days after the occurrence, without his express written consent, of one of the events listed above; provided he gives written notice within 90 days after the event allegedly constituting Good Reason, and the Company will have 30 days after such notice is given to cure. 
If Mr. Fibig's employment terminates on account of death, disability or retirement, he (or his beneficiary or estate) is entitled to any unpaid base salary through the date of termination, any unpaid bonus earned with respect to any fiscal year ending on or preceding the date of termination, payable when bonuses are paid to other senior executives, a pro-rata AIP bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, based on actual performance and payable when bonuses are paid to other senior executives, and all other payments, benefits or perquisites to which he may be entitled under the terms of the Company's programs. Mr. Fibig will not be entitled to any payment (including any tax gross-up) respecting taxes he may owe under IRC Section 4999 (so-called "golden parachute taxes"). The separation benefits payments are subject to Mr. Fibig's delivery to us of an executed general release, resignation from all offices, directorships and fiduciary positions with us and continued compliance with restrictive covenants regarding non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, cooperation and non-disparagement. Upon a termination of Mr. Fibig's employment for any reason, the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants continue to apply for two years.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table shows the estimated payments and value of benefits that we would provide to each of our NEOs if the triggering events described in the heading of the table had occurred on December 31, 2018. 
We do not provide any additional benefits to our NEOs upon a voluntary resignation or termination for Cause. Certain assumptions made for purposes of presenting this information and certain amounts not reflected in the table are explained below or in the footnotes to the table. 
For all cases, the per-share market price of our common stock is assumed to be $134.27, the actual closing price per share on the last trading day of 2018. In preparing the estimates in this table, we have assumed that any CiC would also constitute a "change in ownership and control" for purposes of the golden parachute excise tax rules. All amounts included in the table are stated in the aggregate, even if the payments will be made on a monthly basis. Except as noted in footnote (7) of the table, these amounts do not include payments and benefits to the extent that they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination of employment. The salary, AIP award and LTIP award otherwise payable to each NEO through December 31, 2018 is included in the Summary Compensation Table. In addition to the amounts set forth in the table below, in the event of a CiC, the aggregate balance held in our DCP for each of our NEOs who participate in that plan will be automatically accelerated and settled within five business days of the CiC, as opposed to the participant's deferral election. The amounts that would have been accelerated in the event of a CiC as well as, in all other cases, the amounts each of our NEOs who participate in that plan would have received according to the participant's deferral election, are shown in the Aggregate Balance at Fiscal Year-End column of the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table.

Prorated amounts are based on the number of days worked in each performance period divided by the total number of days in each performance  period for each relevant LTIP cycle. This amount does not take into account the actual AIP amounts paid out under the completed 2016-2018 LTIP cycle, which are discussed in the narrative following the Grants of Plan-Based Award Table under the  heading "Long-Term Incentive Plan."

(7)  For termination due to involuntary termination not for cause or by the executive for good reason absent a CiC,  this amount represents the value of equity that would continue to vest on a prorated basis. For termination due to death or disability more than two years prior to a CiC, the amounts in this row represent the aggregate value of RSU, PRS and PRSU  awards which would immediately vest upon occurrence of the termination event. For termination events within two years after a CiC, the amounts in this row represent the aggregate  in-the-money value of the SSARs, RSUs, PRS, PRSUs and other equity awards which would become vested as a direct result of the CiC before the stated vesting date  specified in the applicable equity award document. The calculation of these amounts does not discount the value of awards based on the portion of the vesting period elapsed at the date of the CiC.

[END TABLE]
We also will consider other business that properly comes before the meeting in accordance with New York law and our By-Laws. 
Who can vote? 
Holders of our common stock at the close of business on March 6, 2019, are entitled to vote their shares at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As of March 6, 2019, there were 106,634,767 shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock issued and outstanding is entitled to one vote. 
What constitutes a quorum, and why is a quorum required? 
We are required to have a quorum of shareholders present to conduct business at the meeting. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the 106,634,767 shares entitled to vote on the record date (53,317,384 shares) will constitute a quorum, permitting us to conduct the business of the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. Shares of common stock for which we have received executed proxies will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum at the meeting, regardless of how or whether such shares are voted on any specific proposal. 
What is the difference between a "shareholder of record" and a "street name" holder? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered a "shareholder of record" or a "registered shareholder" of those shares. In this case, your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") has been sent to you directly by us. 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee or custodian (each, a "Broker"), including shares you may own as a participant in one of our 401(k) plans, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares, which are held in "street name." A Notice has been forwarded to you by or on behalf of your Broker, who is considered the shareholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your Broker how to vote your shares by following the instructions for voting set forth in the Notice.

• in person at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Detailed instructions for Internet and telephone voting are set forth in the Notice, which contains instructions on how to access our proxy statement, annual report and shareholder notice online, and the printed proxy card. 
If your shares are held in one of our 401(k) plans, your proxy will serve as a voting instruction for the trustee of the 401(k) plan, who will vote your shares as you instruct. To allow sufficient time for the trustee to vote, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time on April 30, 2019. If the trustee does not receive your instructions by that date, the trustee will vote the shares you hold through the 401(k) plan in the same proportion as those shares in the 401(k) plan for which voting instructions were received. 
If you are a beneficial owner, but do not hold your shares through the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (the "TASE"), you must follow the voting procedures of your Broker. 
If you are a beneficial owner and your shares are held through the TASE, you must sign and date your proxy card, and attach to it a proof of ownership certificate from the TASE Clearing House Member through which your shares are held (which you can obtain from your TASE broker), which certificate indicates that you were the beneficial owner of such shares as of the record date, and return the proxy card, along with the proof of ownership certificate, to the Company, c/o Gornitzky & Co., via fax to +972-3-560-6555, Attention: Ari Fried, Adv., or by e-mail to: IFFproxy@gornitzky.com. 
What are the requirements to elect the director nominees and to approve each of the proposals in this proxy statement? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Proposal     Vote Required 
       1.    Election of Directors       Majority of Votes Cast 
       1.    Election of Directors       Majority of Votes Cast 
     2.    Ratification of Independent Registered Public  Accounting Firm     Majority of Votes Cast 
     3.    Say on Pay     Majority of Votes Cast 
[END TABLE]
Under our By-Laws, in an uncontested election of directors, as we have this year, a majority of votes cast is required in order for a director to be elected, which means that a nominee must receive a greater number of votes "FOR" his or her election than votes "AGAINST" in order to be elected. Abstentions are not counted as votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" a director nominee. 
The votes cast "FOR" must exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" the ratification of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Abstentions are not counted as votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" this proposal. 
Proposal 3 is an advisory vote. This means that while we ask shareholders to approve a resolution regarding Say on Pay, it is not an action that requires shareholder approval. If a majority of votes are cast "FOR" the Say on Pay proposal, we will consider the proposal to be approved. Abstentions are not counted as votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" this proposal and will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.

 INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING  
What if I am a beneficial owner and I do not give the nominee voting instructions? 
If you are a beneficial owner and your shares are held in "street name," the Broker is bound by the rules of the NYSE regarding whether or not it can exercise discretionary voting power for any particular proposal if the Broker has not received voting instructions from you. Brokers have the authority to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine matters. A broker non-vote occurs when a Broker returns a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because the Broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposal and has not received specific voting instructions for the proposal from the beneficial owner of the shares. Broker non-votes are considered to be present at the meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but are not counted as votes cast. 
The table below sets forth, for each proposal on the ballot, whether a Broker can exercise discretion and vote your shares absent your instructions and, if not, the impact of such broker non-vote on the approval of the proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Proposal   Can Brokers Vote Absent   Instructions?     Impact of Broker     Non-Vote     
       1.  Election of Directors      No      None 
       1.  Election of Directors      No      None 
     2. Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting  Firm   Yes   Not Applicable 
     3. Say on Pay   No   None 
[END TABLE]
What if I sign and return my proxy without making any selections? 
If you sign and return your proxy without making any selections, your shares will be voted "FOR" each of the director nominees and "FOR" Proposals 2 and 3. If other matters properly come before the meeting, the proxy holders will have the authority to vote on those matters for you at their discretion. If your shares are held in "street name" or through the TASE, see the question above on how to vote your shares. 
How do I change my vote? 
A shareholder of record may revoke his or her proxy by giving written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary before the meeting, by delivering a later-dated proxy (either in writing, by telephone or over the Internet), or by voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in "street name," you may change your vote by following your Broker's procedures for revoking or changing your proxy. 
If you are a beneficial owner and your shares are held through the TASE, you may revoke or change your vote at any time before the meeting by: (i) communicating such change in writing to our Corporate Secretary or by executing and delivering a later-dated proxy to the Company, c/o Gornitzky & Co., via fax to +972-3-560-6555, Attention: Ari Fried, Adv., or by e-mail to: IFFproxy@gornitzky.com, or (ii) by voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in "How do I vote?" above and "Who can attend the 2019 Annual Meeting" below. 
What shares are covered by my proxy card? 
Your proxy reflects all shares owned by you at the close of business on March 6, 2019. For participants in our 401(k) plans, shares held in your account as of that date are included in your proxy. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means that you hold shares in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, you should sign and return each proxy card. Alternatively, if you vote by telephone or via the Internet, you will need to vote once for each proxy card and voting instruction card you receive.

 INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING 
Who can attend the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
Only shareholders and our invited guests are permitted to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. To gain admittance, you must bring a form of personal identification to the meeting, where your name will be verified against our record date shareholder list. If a Broker holds your shares and you plan to attend the meeting, you should bring a brokerage statement showing your ownership of the shares as of the record date or a letter from the Broker confirming such ownership, and a form of personal identification. If you wish to vote your shares that are held by a Broker at the meeting, you must obtain a proxy from your Broker and bring such proxy to the meeting. 
If you hold your shares through the TASE and you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, you must bring the proof of ownership certificate from the TASE's Clearing House Member through which your shares are held, which certificate indicates that you were the beneficial owner of the shares as of the record date, as well as picture identification, such as a valid Israeli driver's license or passport, for purposes of personal identification. 
If I plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, should I still vote by proxy? 
Yes. Casting your vote in advance does not affect your right to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. If you send in your proxy card and also attend the meeting, you do not need to vote again at the meeting unless you want to change your vote. Written ballots will be available at the 2019 Annual Meeting for shareholders of record. 
How can I listen to the live audio webcast of the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
You may listen to a live audio webcast of the 2019 Annual Meeting at www.iff.com. The webcast will allow you to listen to the Annual Meeting, but shareholders accessing the 2019 Annual Meeting through the webcast will not be considered present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will not be able to vote their shares through the webcast or ask questions. If you plan to listen to the live audio webcast, then please submit your vote prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting using one of the methods described under "How do I vote?" above. An archived copy of the webcast will be available at www.iff.com following the 2019 Annual Meeting. Registration to listen to the webcast will be required. We have included our website address for reference only. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement.

Other Matters 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports with the SEC relating to their common stock ownership and changes in such ownership, and to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on a review of our records and certain written representations received from our executive officers and directors, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders were complied with on a timely basis, except for one late filing disclosing four transactions by Winder. 
Proxy Solicitation Costs 
We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or employees in person, by telephone, by facsimile or by electronic mail. We have retained Georgeson Inc. to assist in proxy solicitation for a fee of $9,000 plus expenses. We will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their costs in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock. 
Shareholder Proposals 
In order for a shareholder proposal or proposed director nomination to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for next year's annual meeting of shareholders, the Secretary of our Company must receive the written proposal no later than November 19, 2019. Under Article I, Section 3 of our By-Laws, in order for a shareholder to submit a proposal or to nominate any director at next year's annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must give written notice to the Secretary of our Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of this year's annual meeting of shareholders provided next year's annual meeting is called for on a date that is within 30 days before or after such anniversary date. Assuming that next year's annual meeting is held on schedule, we must receive written notice of an intention to introduce a nomination or other item of business at that meeting between January 1, 2020 and January 31, 2020. The notice must also meet all other requirements contained in our By-Laws, including the requirement to contain specified information about the proposed business or the director nominee and the shareholder making the proposal. 
As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not know of any matters to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If any other matters should properly come before the meeting, proxies in the enclosed form will be voted on those matters in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies, unless otherwise specified. 
Shareholder Communications 
Shareholders and other parties interested in communicating directly with the Lead Director, the non-management directors as a group or all directors as a group may do so by writing to the Lead Director or the non-management directors or the Board, in each case, c/o General Counsel and Secretary, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., 521 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019. All communications should include the name, address, telephone number and email address (if any) of the person submitting the communication and indicate whether the person is a shareholder of our Company. 
The Board has approved a process for handling correspondence received by our Company on behalf of the Lead Director, the non-management directors as a group or all directors as a group. Under that process, 
IFF  |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  89 
 OTHER MATTERS 
 the General Counsel reviews all such correspondence and maintains a log of, and forwards to the appropriate Board member, correspondence that is relevant to (i) the functions of the Board or committees thereof or (ii) other significant matters involving our Company. The General Counsel may screen frivolous or unlawful communications and commercial advertisements. Directors may review the log maintained by the General Counsel at any time. 
Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of our internal auditor and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters. 
Electronic Delivery 
This year we again have elected to take advantage of the SEC's rule that allows us to furnish proxy materials to you online. We believe electronic delivery will expedite shareholders' receipt of materials, while lowering costs and reducing the environmental impact of our 2019 Annual Meeting by reducing printing and mailing of full sets of materials. We mailed the Notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and annual report online on or about March 18, 2019. If you would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, the Notice contains instructions on how to receive a paper copy. 
Householding 
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, shareholders of record who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of our Notice, unless one or more of these shareholders notifies us that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure will reduce our printing costs and postage fees. 
If you are eligible for householding, but you and other shareholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of the Notice, or if you hold stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy of the Notice for your household, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, by calling 1-800-542-1061, or by forwarding a written request addressed to Broadridge Financial Solutions, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. 
If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the Notice, or if you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of the Notice in the future, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions as indicated above. Beneficial shareholders can request information about householding from their nominee.

We will furnish without charge to each person whose proxy is being solicited, upon request of any such person, a copy of the 2019 Annual Report as filed with the SEC, including the financial statements and schedules thereto, but not the exhibits.

Income tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments are calculated based on the applicable statutory  tax rate for each jurisdiction in which such charges were incurred, except for those items which are non-taxable for which the tax expense (benefit) was calculated at 0%. For fiscal year 2018, these non-GAAP adjustments were not subject to foreign tax credits or valuation allowances, but to the extent that such factors are applicable to any future non-GAAP adjustments we  will take such factors into consideration in calculating the tax expense (benefit). For amortization, the tax benefit has been calculated based on the Company's adjusted worldwide effective tax rate.
