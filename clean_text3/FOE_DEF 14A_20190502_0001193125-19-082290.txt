Proposal One 
Each of the nominees has agreed to stand for re-election. While we have no reason to believe that any of these nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting, in the unlikely event that any of them does not stand for re-election, the shares represented by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting may be voted for the election of a substitute nominee named by the Board. 
Board Composition and Diversity 
Presented below is a depiction of the expected independence and tenure of our Board of Directors immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting, assuming the election of the nominees named in the proxy statement. 
The Board of Directors encourages a diversity of backgrounds among its members and has a Corporate Governance Principle in place demonstrating its commitment to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. The Board considers candidates with significant direct or indirect experience that will provide the Board of Directors as a whole with the talents, skills, diversity and expertise to serve the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board believes that it benefits from being comprised of men and women with a rich diversity of backgrounds and experiences, who work together in a positive and collegial fashion and demonstrate the ability to act effectively on behalf of all of the Company's shareholders. 
Vote Required for Approval 
The six nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast by the shares present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the meeting will be elected Directors, subject to the Policy of the Board of Directors Relating to Majority Voting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered as shares voted "for" or "withheld" in the election of nominees. 
If you return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of Mr. Lorber, Ms. Ogilvie, Mr. Ross, Mr. Spizzo, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Vargo. 
If you hold your shares in "street name" and do not provide specific voting instructions to the bank or broker or do not obtain a proxy from such bank or broker to vote those shares, then your shares will not be voted in the election of Directors. 
Proposal One 
Board Recommendation 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of each of Mr. Lorber, Ms. Ogilvie, Mr. Ross, Mr. Spizzo, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Vargo. Unless you instruct otherwise on your proxy card or by telephone or Internet voting instructions, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. 
Board Meetings and Attendance 
During 2018, the Board met 6 times. Each Director attended at least 75% of the total number of Board and committee meetings held during his or her tenure, with the exception of Mr. Hyland whose health issues during 2018 precluded his full participation. In accordance with Ferro's Corporate Governance Principles, the Directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meetings of Shareholders. All of the Directors then in office attended the 2018 Annual Meeting, except for Richard J. Hipple, whose term expired at the 2018 Annual Meeting, and Mr. Hyland. 
Corporate Governance 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate Governance Attributes and Principles 
The Board of Directors and management believe that good corporate governance enhances investor confidence and increases shareholder value. Certain corporate governance attributes are listed on page 2. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles, which are intended to ensure that Ferro's Director qualifications, committee structure and overall Board processes facilitate good corporate governance and independent oversight of the Company's management. The Corporate Governance Principles may be accessed on Ferro's website (www.ferro.com). 
Director Independence 
The Board has adopted formal Guidelines for Determining Director Independence. The purpose of these Guidelines is to assist the Board in its evaluation of and determination regarding the independence of members of the Board. The Guidelines meet or exceed the independence standards set forth in section 303A of the NYSE listing standards, and the Board has determined that all Directors and Director nominees, other than Mr. Thomas, recommended by the Board for re-election qualify as "independent" under such Guidelines. The Guidelines may be accessed on Ferro's website (www.ferro.com). 
Majority Voting Policy 
The Board has adopted the Policy of the Board of Directors Relating to Majority Voting (the "Majority Voting Policy"). Pursuant to the Majority Voting Policy, in the event of an uncontested election — an election in which the number of nominees for Director does not exceed the number of Directors to be elected — where a nominee for Director receives more votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election, such Director is expected to tender to the Governance & Nomination Committee his or her resignation as a Director. The Governance & Nomination Committee of the Board will then consider the resignation tendered and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it. If the Board rejects the Director's resignation, the Director will continue to serve for the remainder of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. If the Board accepts the Director's resignation, then the Board in its sole discretion may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the number of Directors comprising the Board. The Governance & Nomination Committee, in making its recommendation, and the Board, in making its decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate. 
Corporate Governance 
Board Committees 
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance & Nomination Committee. Copies of the charters for each of the committees are posted on the Company's website (www.ferro.com), under "Investor Relations" and are available to any stockholder in hard copy upon request to the Company. Information regarding the committees is set forth in the following table:

Corporate Governance 
Director Nomination Process 
The Governance & Nomination Committee reviews the credentials of potential Director candidates (including potential candidates recommended by shareholders), conducts interviews, and makes formal recommendations to the Board for the annual and any interim election of Directors. In making its recommendations, pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, the Governance & Nomination Committee considers a variety of factors, including skills, independence, background, experience, diversity, and compatibility with existing Board members. The Governance & Nomination Committee may also consider such other factors as it deems appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Governance & Nomination Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. If any Board member is of retirement age or does not wish to continue in service, or if the Governance & Nomination Committee or the Board decides not to nominate a member for re-election, then the Committee considers the desired skills and experience that it would like Director candidates and the Board as a whole to have in light of the criteria outlined above. The Governance & Nomination Committee considers potential Director candidates that may be recommended by the Board, senior management, shareholders and consultants. All candidates, regardless of the source of the recommendation, are considered in the same manner. 
The Governance & Nomination Committee considered each Director's leadership experience, specific industry or manufacturing experience, and familiarity with global operations. The Directors hold or have held executive officer positions or serve or have served on boards of directors in organizations that have provided them experience in operations, management, risk management, governance and leadership development. The Board and the Governance & Nomination Committee believe that these skills and qualifications, combined with diverse backgrounds and the ability to work in a positive and collegial fashion, benefit Ferro and Ferro's shareholders by creating a strong and effective Board. 
The Governance & Nomination Committee will consider candidates for the Board who are recommended by shareholders in accordance with the provisions in the Company's Amended and Restated Code of Regulations ("Code of Regulations"). Shareholder recommendations must be submitted in writing to: Secretary, Ferro Corporation, 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124 USA, not less than 90 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders. The recommendation notice should include the information required by the Company's Code of Regulations, including, but not limited to, (a) certain biographical and share ownership information concerning the nominee and the shareholder proponent, (b) a description of any arrangements between the shareholder proponent (and certain affiliates) and any other person or entity with respect to the nomination, including the nominee, and (c) a written consent of the nominee to serve as a Director of the Company, if elected, and a representation regarding the nominee's voting commitments or actions as a Director, as well as that the nominee will comply with the Company's corporate governance and other policies, principles and guidelines. The Company may also require a candidate to furnish additional information regarding his or her eligibility and qualifications. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Ferro's Board leadership structure consists of a combined CEO and Chairman of the Board, along with an independent Lead Director. Ferro believes that a combined CEO and Chairman of the Board role is appropriate because it provides an efficient and effective leadership structure for Ferro. It promotes alignment between the Board and management on Ferro's strategic objectives, facilitates effective presentation of information to enable the Board to fulfill its responsibilities, and allows for productive and effective Board meetings. 
Ferro's non-management Directors, all of whom are independent, meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions several times each year. These sessions are chaired by the Lead Director. Neither the CEO nor any other member of management attends these sessions except in limited circumstances if requested by the Directors. Following each executive session, the Lead Director or the other non-management Directors share with the CEO or other members of senior management such observations, comments or concerns as the Lead Director and the other non-management Directors deem appropriate. Mr. Lorber, the Chair of the Governance & Nomination Committee, currently serves as the Lead Director. 
Corporate Governance 
The independent Directors have access to Ferro management as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Principles. In addition, the Chairs of the Audit Committee, Governance & Nomination Committee, and Compensation Committee meet periodically with members of senior management. 
The Board examines the Company's corporate governance policies and leadership structure on an ongoing basis. 
Board Education 
Ferro encourages its Directors to participate in recommended continuing education programs focused on current topics of importance to boards, best practices in corporate governance, and legal and ethical responsibilities of directors. The Company reimburses Directors for their expenses associated with attending one director education conference each year. Director education also is provided during board meetings and may include materials and presentations developed internally or by third parties. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Considerations 
Ferro is committed to operating in a manner that upholds the reputation of our Company. In the area of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues, our Board of Directors leads by example, recognizing a range of stakeholders and receiving regular updates on such issues from management. Among other things, management regularly discusses with the Board legal, compliance and ethical issues, including company policies, practices, and training. 
Ferro long has recognized the value of attending to ESG considerations. The Chief Executive Officer, General Counsel, the Director of Environmental, Health and Safety and many other employees monitor and manage ESG issues within our value chain. Ferro seeks to source responsibly, protect employee safety, and develop environmentally friendly products, to name just a few areas of focus. The Company also seeks to ensure accountability for meeting ESG standards. For example, with respect to workplace safety, Ferro ties performance on safety targets to the compensation of executives and managers, including the CEO. 
In 2019, we are undertaking a materiality assessment and engaging with internal and external stakeholders on ESG topics. The outcomes of the assessment will inform the priorities within our ESG strategy. 
Succession Planning 
Our Board considers management development and succession planning to be a critical part of the Company's long-term strategy, and has an ongoing program for senior leadership development and succession. The full Board oversees CEO and senior management development and succession plans and each year formally reviews these plans with our CEO. The Board regularly discusses potential CEO candidates and their development and preparedness. 
Discussions with the Board regarding management development and succession planning include consideration of the skills, performance and characteristics of the CEO and other key senior managers and their likely successors, other high-potential associates, the talent pipeline, key hiring decisions and organizational changes, and plans for identification, mentoring, and continuing development of potential internal candidates for leadership positions within the Company. 
Board's Role in Risk Management Oversight 
The Board provides oversight of the Company's risk management through its review of risks associated with the Company's operations and strategic initiatives, both as a Board and, as appropriate, through Board committees. 
The Audit Committee has the central role in risk management oversight on behalf of the Board. The Board receives periodic reports from the Audit Committee with respect to its discussions with management regarding Ferro's 
Corporate Governance assessment and management of risks, any major risk exposures and steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and Ferro's use of certain financial instruments. Management uses an enterprise risk management process to identify, assess, manage and mitigate risks to the Company. The CEO, Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Director of Internal Audit and General Counsel of the Company each periodically report to the Audit Committee with respect to risk management. In addition, the CFO and the Treasurer each periodically report to the Audit Committee with respect to financial risk management and Ferro's use of certain financial instruments. With respect to risk related to compensation matters, the Compensation Committee considers, in establishing and reviewing Ferro's executive compensation program, whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. The Compensation Committee also periodically provides reports to the Board regarding compensation-related risks. The Governance & Nomination Committee addresses risk issues related to the structure, operation, and composition of the Board and its committees. The Governance & Nomination Committee periodically provides reports to the Board on such matters. 
Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that a tenet of good corporate governance is healthy interaction with our shareholders to understand the issues important to them. Our management team regularly engages with shareholders on a variety of topics, including our corporate strategy and performance and corporate governance. In addition, we communicate with shareholders through quarterly earnings calls, press releases, analyst meetings and investor conferences. 
During 2018, members of our management team met with our top 20 largest shareholders, who collectively own over 60% of our outstanding shares, to discuss our business strategy and solicit their views on other matters of interest to them. 
Other Corporate Governance Measures 
Ferro has adopted a series of policies dealing with business conduct and ethics. These policies apply to all Ferro Directors, officers and employees. A summary of our legal and ethical policies may be found on Ferro's website (www.ferro.com) in our Code of Business Conduct, and the full text of the policies is available in print, free of charge, by writing to: Secretary, Ferro Corporation, 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124 USA. The Audit Committee is responsible for the review of the Company's legal and ethical policies. The 
Corporate Governance 
Audit Committee must approve any exception or waiver to these policies. In addition, a description of any exception, amendment or waiver to these policies with respect to the CEO, the CFO and the Company's principal accounting officer, controller or persons performing similar functions will be posted on the Company's website within four business days following the date of the exception, amendment or waiver. Ferro also maintains a hotline, which allows employees throughout the world to report confidentially violations of the Company's legal and ethical conduct policies, consistent with local legal requirements and subject to local legal limitations. In addition, the Governance & Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving any related party transactions. 
Shareholders may communicate with the Board, the Chair of the Board, the Lead Director, a Board committee, the non-employee Directors as a group, or individual Directors by sending written communications addressed to the Board of Directors, a Board committee or such individual Director or Directors, to: Secretary, Ferro Corporation, 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124 USA. 
Each communication should specify the applicable addressee or addressees to be contacted as well as the general topic of the communication. Our Secretary generally will initially review communications before forwarding them to members of the Board to whom the communication is directed or, if the communication is not directed to any specific member(s) of the Board, to the Chair of the Board, the Lead Director or the Chair of the Governance & Nomination Committee. We generally will not forward a shareholder communication that is primarily commercial in nature, relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or requests general information about the Company. Concerns about accounting or auditing matters or possible violations of our any of our policies should be reported pursuant to the procedures outlined in our legal and ethical policies.

Executive Summary 
Ferro is a company that has undergone significant transformation in recent years. Through successful execution of its "Value Creation Strategy," Ferro divested non-core businesses, acquired strategic businesses, changed its culture, and has become a focused and fundamentally stronger business. Today, Ferro is a leading functional coatings and color solutions company with a dramatically improved record of growth and profitability and a strong foundation for the future. 
Ferro has grown both organically and through acquisitions. Organic growth has been revitalized, as we have focused on innovation and providing our customers with market-leading technologies. And since implementing our strategy, Ferro has completed some twenty acquisitions, including several in 2018. The successful execution of our strategy has resulted in stronger financial performance, including higher revenue, higher gross profit, and higher earnings. 
How Ferro Has Improved from 2013 to Today 
In 2013, the Company announced its Value Creation Strategy, which would transform Ferro from a diversified specialty chemicals company to a focused functional coatings and color solutions company. The Value Creation Strategy has centered on: 
1) streamlining operations and reducing operating cost; 
2) divesting underperforming and non-core businesses; and 
3) pursuing high-value growth opportunities. 
The objective was to narrow the Company's focus to enable it to leverage its strengths, including: 
1) business platforms that share core competencies such as color innovation, glass technology, application science, particle engineering know-how and formulation customization; 
2) shared manufacturing infrastructure and processes across business platforms; 
3) leadership positions in niche markets; and 
4) the ability to collaborate with customers to offer customized formulations. 
Execution of the first phase of the strategy, which included implementing cost reduction measures and eliminating inefficiencies, significantly improved the Company's profitability through improved gross profit and reduced Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expense. In the second phase of the strategy, the Company divested five non-core businesses, which resulted in decreased revenue in the short term but enabled the Company to focus on the businesses reflecting its core strengths. The divestitures also generated cash to position the Company to acquire higher-growth, higher-margin businesses in the third phase of the strategy. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
In the course of executing its strategy, Ferro has completed some twenty acquisitions that complement its core businesses, provide attractive margins, and improve its capabilities in important growth markets. The businesses that Ferro acquired, which reside in all three reporting segments, have added to the top line, while also improving profit margins and earnings. 
Ferro currently is in phase four of its Value Creation Strategy: dynamic innovation and optimization. In this phase, Ferro is focused even more intensely on developing innovative products and services that address customer needs and align with broader macro-economic trends and on implementing optimization initiatives that improve the way we do business and drive efficiencies throughout our operations. 
The below diagram sets forth the key components of each phase of our Value Creation Strategy. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Say-on-Pay 
The Compensation Committee considered the most recent "say-on-pay" shareholder advisory vote held in May 2018 regarding the NEOs compensation. The Compensation Committee considered the outcome of the most recent "say-on-pay" vote and the views of shareholders that have been shared with management and concluded that neither suggested a need for consideration of any significant changes to compensation practices at this time. Approximately 96% of shareholder votes cast were in favor of the executive officer compensation as described in our proxy statement. Over the past six years, an average of 95% of votes cast have been in favor of the Company's executive officer compensation. 
Components of Compensation and Alignment between Compensation and Performance 
Base Salary: An executive's base salary is cash compensation that is generally not at risk and is paid to the executive regardless of the performance of the Company in a particular year. 
Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP"): The AIP enables executives to be rewarded for Company performance and shareholder returns. It generally is structured to deliver incentive payouts at the 50th percentile of the competitive market for achievement of target financial performance. 
As it has done in the past, the Committee established a pool to fund the AIP awards based on a shareholder approved metric, which for 2018 was 1.5% of gross profit. A target award amount, based on percentage of base salary, was determined for each executive officer: Mr. Thomas-100%; Mr. Schalter-65% and Mr. Duesenberg-65%. The Committee established Company financial performance metrics for the AIP. For 2018, the performance metric components of the AIP award were EBITDA (70% weighting), budgeted net sales growth (20%), and strategic goals (10%) as described on page 25, based on the budget in the annual operating plan approved by the Board of Directors. Measuring strategic objectives ensures the overall performance of the Company is considered before awards are made. AIP awards also take into account individual performance and the amount calculated by application of the Company performance metrics may be decreased or increased by as much as 20% based upon the individual's performance relative to performance goals established by the Committee. The entire annual bonus is subject to recoupment ("clawback") under the Company's clawback policy. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Long-Term Incentive ("LTI"): A substantial portion of annual compensation is in the form of long-term incentives. In aggregate, long-term incentives comprise 45%-63% of annual pay, as described on page 41. LTI consists of three forms of awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50%: Performance Share Units  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 30%: Stock Options  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 20%: Restricted Share Units  
[END TABLE]
This design ensures that the majority of compensation of senior executives is linked to the performance of the Company stock and resulting shareholder returns. For the long-term incentive awards granted annually both performance share units and restricted share units have a three-year cliff vesting and the stock options have a three-year ratable vesting. The restricted share units are subject to an additional two-year holding period upon vesting, at the end of which the shares of Common Stock are distributed and federal income taxes paid. All stock options have a maximum term of ten years. 
Further reinforcing the pay for performance relationship and the financial goals associated with the dynamic innovation and optimization phase of the Company's strategy, the metrics chosen for the performance share unit grants for the 2018-2020 period were three-year average adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations on invested capital and cumulative EBITDA, each weighted at 50%. The goals for the 2018-2020 performance period include a TSR Modifier, based on Ferro's three-year TSR compared with the TSR for the Specialty Chemicals Index for that period. If Ferro's TSR is at or above the 75th percentile, the payout based on achievement of the financial goals will be increased by 20%. If Ferro's TSR is at or below the 25th percentile, the payout based on achievement of the financial goals will be decreased by 20%. At the end of the vesting period and only if the performance conditions have been met, the executives will receive one-half of the award value in non-forfeitable shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the nominal amount of dividends paid on earned performance share units, if any, and the remaining one-half award value in cash. 
Consistent with the methodology followed in past years, the number of shares granted on February 21, 2018 was calculated based on the average closing stock price during the prior calendar month. The use of an average stock price mitigates the possibility that a significant one-day change in stock value will have a material impact on the number of stock options or share awards granted. For grants made on February 21, 2018, the average closing price during the month of January 2018 used to determine the awards was $24.01 and the actual grant date share price reported in the Summary Compensation Table ("SCT") was $22.01. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Executive Compensation Program Attributes 
Along with its pay for performance orientation and the executive compensation highlights listed on page 3, the Company's executive compensation program includes the following attributes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  Our cash  bonus plans are performance-based.    ✗   We do not engage in compensation programs that create undue risk. 
 ✓  50% of  long-term equity incentives are explicitly performance-based, while another 30% are based on share appreciation above the option exercise price.    ✗   Non-qualified plans do not provide for any above-market interest or guaranteed investment returns. 
 ✓  The  Compensation Committee reviews on an annual basis comprehensive tally sheets, illustrating the total compensation for the most recent two years for each executive officer.    ✗   Dividends may accrue on our performance share units and restricted share units, but are paid only when and to the extent the underlying award is earned and vested. Our award plans and policies prohibit  re-pricing or backdating of awards. 
 ✓  A  severance policy provides for payments consistent with market practices of peer companies.    ✗   Our bonus plans do not include any minimum payment levels or provide guaranteed bonus payments. 
    ✗   Our award plans and policies prohibit re-pricing or backdating of awards. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Guiding Principles 
Ferro is committed to the following guiding principles in the design of its executive compensation program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, Retain, and Align: Provide a total compensation opportunity that will attract and retain an experienced and  high-performing senior management team and direct their efforts toward the achievement of the Company's financial goals and generation of shareholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reward Achievement: Maintain a strong "pay for performance" character by aligning rewards with proven  financial results and changes in shareholder value so that exceptional achievement generates pay that is above market medians and performance below target yields compensation that is below market median; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Remain Competitive: Target aggregate expenditures for each compensation element generally at the 50th percentile of competitive market practices, which includes a custom peer group as well as a general industry group comprised of companies with comparable revenues. In addition to market practices,  factors such as experience, performance, future potential, internal equity and attraction of talent also are considered in establishing compensation, which may result in actual pay levels above the  50th percentile.  
[END TABLE]
Oversight of Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for establishing, implementing  and monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy for the CEO and other executive officers. The Committee sets the compensation of the Company's executive officers, recommends to the Board compensation for the Directors and  oversees management's administration of the other significant employee compensation and benefit plans. In carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the Committee is supported by an independent executive compensation consultant and management  as further described below. The Committee has the sole authority to retain (and terminate) any consultants used to evaluate the Company's executive management compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management: Management of the Company supports the Committee in its assessment of executive compensation, implements  decisions made by the Committee and ensures the Company's compensation plans are administered in accordance with the provisions of the plans. The CEO and the Vice President of Human Resources participate in an advisory capacity in the  Committee's meetings, including the annual compensation review in February each year, provide the Committee with data and analyses and make recommendations with respect to awards to members of the Senior Management Committee, excluding the CEO.  The Committee makes its decisions with respect to the compensation of the CEO in executive session, without the presence of management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Compensation Consultant: The Committee has retained Exequity LLP, an independent compensation  consultant (the "Compensation Consultant"), to advise on executive compensation matters. The Compensation Consultant reports directly to the Committee and provides expertise to the Committee and management on the design of appropriate  executive compensation plans, analysis of the effectiveness of existing plans and the market-competitiveness of base salary, annual incentive levels and long-term incentive awards. The Compensation Consultant also provides advice to the Committee  and management on the competitive elements of the pay program for non-employee Directors. The Compensation Consultant did not provide any additional services to the Company during 2018. In connection with its  engagement of the Compensation Consultant, the Committee reviewed a conflict of interest assessment and found that no conflicts of interest exists.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Peer Group 
For compensation decisions made in February 2018, the Compensation Consultant provided competitive market data for both a custom peer group and a 40-company general industry group. 
The companies comprising the custom peer group were selected based on factors including company size (e.g., revenues, market capitalization and employees), products, end-use markets and degree of global operations. The annual revenues for the peer group companies generally ranged from one-half to two times the Company's annual revenues, and these companies overlapped significantly with the Company's businesses and end-use markets. 
Data for the custom peer group comes from the Equilar database and, for companies not reporting the information to Equilar, from proxy disclosures. Data from the custom peer group and general industry group were used to identify competitive base salaries, annual incentive targets, target total cash compensation, long-term incentives and total direct compensation (cash compensation plus long-term incentives) for the CEO and other executive officers. These competitive pay levels served as a basis for the Committee's annual review of the Company's pay programs. The Committee considered this information in establishing base salaries, annual incentive targets and long-term incentive awards. The Committee approves all pay decisions related to the NEOs and other executive officers, if any. 
The general industry group represents companies from a broader range of industries, and is composed of 20 companies with revenues higher and 20 companies with revenues lower than the Company. The Compensation Consultant provides this list of companies and their pay practices to the Committee. Pay practices for the general industry group, all of which are reported to the Equilar database, establish a secondary reference point to confirm the validity of the findings from the custom peer group proxy statement analysis, and provide a broader perspective on compensation practices across the market within which the Company competes for senior executives. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
The peer group listed below was approved at the Committee's July 2017 meeting and was used as a factor in making February 2018 compensation decisions. Chemtura Corporation, which had been included in the peer group, was acquired in April 2017, and thus was removed from the peer group. The peer group is otherwise consistent with prior years.

2018 Executive Compensation Decisions 
At its February 21, 2018 meeting, the Committee reviewed the compensation for the executive officers. The Committee considered the competitive market data provided by the Compensation Consultant for base salary, annual incentive targets and long-term incentive awards, the recommendations of the CEO, and the experience, tenure and performance of each executive. Mr. Schlater's base salary increase reflects recognition of alignment to market median.

Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
At its meetings in February 2019, the Committee reviewed the Company's performance compared to the goals for determining payouts for the 2018 AIP. Actual results at the corporate level were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  EBITDA is calculated as operating profit plus the depreciation and amortization included in operating profit. One-time charges, including restructuring, impairment charges and discontinued operations are excluded from operating profit. For divestitures made during 2018, actual results were measured through the date of  divestiture and budgeted performance assumed for the remainder of the year. Acquisitions made in 2018 were excluded from the calculation. The calculation was made on a 2017 constant currency basis relative to the approved budget.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Budgeted Net Sales Growth is calculated as year over year change in net sales on a 2017 constant currency basis relative  to the approved budget. For divestitures made during 2018, actual results were measured through the date of divestiture and budgeted performance assumed for the remainder of the year. Acquisitions made in 2018 were excluded from the calculation.   
[END TABLE]
The Committee also reviewed performance related to the Company's strategic goals. Reference page 20. 
Actual results for the AIP financial metrics were slightly below target for EBITDA and above target for budgeted net sales growth. At the recommendation of senior executives, the Committee determined to reduce the amount of the AIP funding pool because certain objectives set by the management team in the course of the year that were not among the AIP goals established at the beginning of the year were not achieved. Consequently, annual cash compensation paid to executive officers for 2018 was below individual target levels and generally was below market median, consistent with the plan design of delivering rewards according to performance. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Based upon the financial results, the achievements related to the strategic goals of the Company and discussion of each executive officer's contributions during 2018, the Committee determined that each of the executive officers would receive an AIP payout at 88.2% of target as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Committee also reviewed the results for the goals established for performance share unit grants awarded in February 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period: 
Total number of shares earned, 167.5% of the amount awarded, was based on achievement of the Three-Year Return on Invested Capital at 144.2% of target; achievement of the Cumulative Gross Margin at 150.8% of target and the application of the 20% TSR Modifier. Actual payouts are shown below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Three-Year Average Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is the sum of the ROIC for each of the years in the performance  period (2016, 2017 and 2018), divided by three. ROIC for each year of the performance period is the ratio of adjusted tax-affected operating income (excluding charges and precious metal lease expenses) to  average invested capital during the year. Average invested capital is equal to the total of invested capital at the end of the fourth quarter of the prior year and each quarter of the year, with the sum divided by five. Invested capital is equal to  total equity plus net debt. Total equity is measured by the value on the consolidated balance sheet. Total debt is equal to balance sheet short-term plus long-term debt plus net pension liability plus the value of precious metal leases less cash  (including precious metal collateral). Acquisitions and site consolidations made in the 3-year performance period will be excluded.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Cumulative Gross Margin dollars are the sum of net sales less cost of sales, excluding  one-time charges, for each year of the performance period (2016, 2017 and 2018). Acquisitions made in the 3-year performance period will be excluded, with the exception  of Ferer. For divestitures made during the 3-year performance period, actual results will be measured through the date of divestiture and budgeted performance assumed for the remainder of the performance  period.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  TSR Modifier shall be (i) +20% if the 3-year Ferro TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the Specialty Chemicals Index TSR, (ii) -20% if the 3-year Ferro TSR is at or below the 25th percentile of the Specialty Chemicals Index TSR, and (iii) shall otherwise be 0%. Under no circumstances, shall the application of the TSR modifier result in a total payout greater than 200% of  target. The TSR modifier shall be determined based on a comparison of Ferro's TSR over the 3-year performance cycle against the TSR for the Specialty Chemicals Index for such period. TSR shall mean the  change in the value of the Common Stock over the 3-year performance cycle, taking into account both stock price appreciation (or depreciation) and the reinvestment of dividends, which shall be deemed to have  been reinvested in the underlying company's stock effective the ex-dividend date based on the closing price for such company for purposes of measuring TSR. The beginning and ending stock prices will be  based on the average closing stock prices during the months of December 2015 and December 2018, respectively. The Company will use a formula for determining the Company's percentile rank such as the Microsoft Excel function PERCENTRANK. The  Company's rank as a percentile will be calculated excluding the Company from the peer group.

[END TABLE]
2018 Executive Compensation Pay Considerations 
The Compensation Committee of the Board regularly monitors compensation relative to the market. In setting compensation for Mr. Thomas for 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to increase his base salary 3%, maintain at 100% his target bonus, and provide a 5% increase to his long-term incentives, resulting in target compensation above the aggregate 50th percentile and still providing the opportunity for appropriate reward for strong performance. Although the Committee recognized that the CEO's target compensation is above the 50th percentile of market pay, the Committee gave its approval because the CEO has been successfully leading the Company's execution of its Value Creation Strategy. As the Company's size continues to change, the Committee will continue to monitor the relative positioning of our CEO's and Named Executive Officers' ("NEOs") pay and adjust or not adjust accordingly while considering factors beyond just market pay, i.e., including strategy execution, performance, retention and attraction of talent. 
Additional Information Concerning Executive Compensation 
Use of Tally Sheets 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed comprehensive tally sheets illustrating the total compensation for the most recent two years for each NEO and the compensation and benefits payable upon termination, including voluntary termination, involuntary separation, and change in control. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Ferro has maintained stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers since 1998, reinforcing one of the key objectives of the Company's pay program, i.e., the alignment of pay with the interests of shareholders. The guidelines are reviewed and updated periodically to support their intended purpose. The current guidelines, updated in December of 2015, require the CEO to achieve target ownership of five times base salary, the CFO to achieve target ownership of three times base salary, and other executive officers to achieve target ownership of two times base salary. Newly hired executives have five years to achieve their target ownership levels. The Company's NEOs meet or exceed the established guidelines with the exception of Mr. Schlater, who has five years from the date on which he assumed the Vice President & Chief Financial Officer position to meet the stock ownership guideline for that position. 
Shares of Common Stock deemed to be owned by each executive officer include shares owned outright with no restrictions, restricted share grants, restricted share unit grants, shares owned in the 401(k) Plan, and shares deemed to be invested in Common Stock through the Deferred Compensation Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Retirement Benefits 
In previous years, the Company offered its employees a defined benefit plan known as the Ferro Corporation Pension Plan for Legacy Employees (the "DB Plan") and, for executive employees, a supplemental defined benefit program, known as the Ferro Corporation Supplemental Defined Benefit Plan for Executive Employees (the "Supplemental DB Plan"). The DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan provided employees annuity payments in retirement according to pre-determined formulas. The plans were frozen as to new participants effective July 1, 2003 and no additional accruals have been made since 2006. Mr. Thomas, who was hired prior to July 1, 2003, is the only executive officer who has earned a benefit under the DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan. 
Consequently, the primary retirement benefits for executive officers are a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan, called the Ferro Corporation 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), and its companion non-qualified defined contribution plan, called the Ferro Corporation Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan for Executive Employees (the "Supplemental 401(k) Plan"). Eligible earnings include both the base salary and AIP award amounts. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan primarily provides participants with Company contributions that would have been made to their 401(k) and basic pension contribution accounts under the 401(k) Plan were it not for tax law limitations. The Supplemental 401(k) Plan allows participants the option of a deemed investment in either Common Stock or the stable asset fund under the 401(k) Plan. No premium or guaranteed investment return is provided. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Executive officers are eligible to participate in the Ferro Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Executive Employees (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). There are no executive officers participating in the Deferred Compensation Plan at this time and no executive officer has a balance in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferrals under the plan have been suspended since 2010. 
Change in Control Agreements 
For many years, the Board has recognized that there is always a possibility of a fundamental change in the Company's ownership and control through a "change in control." Any such threatened or actual change in control would create uncertainties and raise questions that could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board determined that appropriate steps needed to be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disruptive circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control. Consequently, the Company has entered into change in control agreements with each of the executive officers. Change in control agreements do not include an excise tax gross-up or a modified single trigger provision, except for those agreements entered into prior to 2010, and only one NEO has a grandfathered agreement. For additional information on payments to executive officers as a result of a change in control, see the discussion under Termination and Change in Control Payments beginning on page 40. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code precludes the Company from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to our "covered employees" (which includes the CEO and our three other most highly-compensated executive officers, other than the Chief Financial Officer, for years prior to 2018). Prior to 2018 (and including tax years that began prior to January 1, 2018), this limitation did not apply to "performance-based" compensation. While the Compensation Committee has generally attempted to maximize the tax deductibility of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that the primary purpose of our compensation program is to support the Company's business strategy and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Therefore, the Compensation Committee has maintained the flexibility to award compensation that may not be tax-deductible if doing so furthers the objectives of our executive compensation program. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Under the recent U.S. tax reform, the exception to Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation has been repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to certain transition and grandfathering rules. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer is now included as a covered employee. Despite these new limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee continues to believe that a significant portion of our named executive officers' compensation should be tied to the Company's performance. Therefore, it is not currently anticipated that the changes to Section 162(m) will significantly impact the design of our compensation program going forward. 
Mitigation of Excessive Risk-Taking 
Compensation Policies and Practices as Related to Risk Management 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee conducted its annual risk assessment of the compensation policies and practices covering executive and non-executive employees. The Compensation Committee evaluated the levels of risk-taking to determine whether they are appropriate in the context of long-term value creation and viability, the overall compensation arrangements, and the Company's overall risk profile. The Compensation Committee concluded that the Company has a balanced pay for performance executive compensation program that does not encourage excessive risk-taking and the Company does not maintain compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 
The Compensation Committee has approved and implemented a formal compensation Clawback Policy. The policy allows the recovery of compensation from certain current and former key employees, including executive officers, in the event that Ferro is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements and the employees willfully committed an act of fraud, dishonesty or recklessness that contributed to Ferro's obligation to prepare the accounting restatement. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
The Company has a policy against short sales of Ferro securities, and hedging or monetization activities involving Ferro securities, including but not limited to, equity swaps, collars, exchange funds and prepaid variable forward contracts. In addition, none of the Directors or executive officers is party to any pledge arrangements with respect to their stock holdings. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During 2018, no officer or employee of Ferro served as a member of the Compensation Committee, nor were there any interlocking relationships (as described in Item 407(e)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K) between members of the Compensation Committee and Ferro. 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with Ferro's management the Compensation Discussion & Analysis set forth above. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
We are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Peter Thomas, pursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K: 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than Mr. Thomas), was $39,243;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of Mr. Thomas, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 32, was  $4,814,836; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Thomas to the median of the  annual total compensation of all employees was 123 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
We are a global company with consolidated subsidiaries in over 30 countries. Approximately 87% of our employees are located outside of the United States, with many in lower cost jurisdictions. We compete for talent locally and have different compensation structures depending on the location and the nature of the business operations conducted at each of our locations (e.g. research and development, manufacturing, sales, etc.). 
The following describes how we identified the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as the annual total compensation of the "median employee," including the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used. 
We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, we had 6,059 employees, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 27, 2019 (our "Annual Report"). We included approximately 366 employees of companies we acquired during 2018. 
Because of the different elements of compensation in different jurisdictions, we believe base salary, which is a fixed and primary element of compensation, is an appropriate measure to determine the median employee. We maintain base salary information for all employees, and we converted salaries to U.S. dollars to determine the median employee. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee. Based on this methodology, we first determined our median employee during 2017 as a production worker in France whose base salary for 2018 was $27,708. The applicable SEC rules require us to identify a "median employee" only once every three years, as long as there have been no material changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our CEO pay ratio disclosure. Because there have been no material changes in our employee population or employee compensation 
Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the Company's CEO pay ratio disclosure, we are using the same "median employee" for our 2018 CEO Pay Ratio that we used for our 2017 CEO Pay Ratio, although we have updated the calculation of the total compensation earned by that employee for 2018. 
We calculated the median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $39,243. The difference between such employee's wages and overtime pay and the employee's annual total compensation represents the estimated value of such employee's seniority allowance, extra hour pay and shift allowance, but does not include state sponsored health and retirement benefits. 
We did not make any adjustments to the annual total compensation figure for Mr. Thomas as shown in the summary compensation table on page 32 to calculate the reported ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Thomas to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of awards to the executive  officers listed in this table in 2018, 2017, and 2016, computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM  ("ASC") Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation. With respect to the performance share units awarded, these values are based upon the probable outcome of the relevant performance goals. The valuation methodology used to  calculate the figures in this column is described in footnote 13 (Stock-Based Compensation) in the audited financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year  ended December 31, 2018. For a description of the Company's restricted share, restricted share unit and performance share unit awards, see the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings.  Amounts in this column include the change in value under the Company's defined benefit pension plans: the DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan. Mr. Thomas is the only executive officer listed in this table who is eligible for a benefit  under the DB Plan or the Supplemental DB Plan because he was hired before July 1, 2003, when the plan was frozen to new entrants. He did not accrue any additional benefits after March 31, 2006 when the plans were frozen as to future  benefit accruals. Consequently, the changes in pension value listed in this table for Mr. Thomas, relating to 2018, 2017, and 2016 are due to the changes in present value factors, which are required to be updated each year. The measurement  periods for 2018, 2017, and 2016 are the 12-month periods ending December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. A zero was reported for the change in pension value for Mr. Thomas' 2018 earnings  because the calculation resulted in a change of value of $(38,837). For additional information regarding these plans, please see the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above and Post-Employment Compensation on  page 38 below.

(1)  This column contains the possible payouts under the AIP. See Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis  beginning on page 18 above for a discussion of the AIP. For the 2018 AIP, 90% is based on the achievement of financial metrics, while 10% is based on achievement of strategic personal performance goals. The AIP target percentages for 2018 are  multiplied by the executive's base annual salary rate and assume an achievement of 100% on financial metrics and strategic personal performance goals to arrive at the target amount in this table. The AIP target percentages for 2018 are 100% for  Mr. Thomas, 65% for Mr. Schlater, and 65% for Mr. Duesenberg. The AIP threshold reflects 25% of the applicable target percentage and the AIP maximum reflects 200% of the applicable target percentage. The actual payout of the AIP for  2018 appears in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 32 above. See the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above  for more information on the 2018 AIP.

2018 Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amounts reported in this column represent the number of performance share units granted in 2018 under the LTIP that  would be earned assuming performance achievement at threshold (25%), target (100%) and maximum (200%). No exercise price or other consideration is paid by the executive officers with respect to performance share unit awards. The measurement period  for performance share unit awards is the three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020. See the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above for a discussion of performance  share units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The amounts reported in this column represent restricted share units awarded to each executive officer in 2018 under the  LTIP. No exercise price or other consideration is paid by the executive officers with respect to restricted share unit awards. These restricted share units vest three years after the grant date and are subject to a  two-year holding period after vesting. In the case of death, disability or change in control combined with certain termination of employment, restricted share units become 100% vested and will be delivered to  the executive officer or, in the case of death, the applicable beneficiary. See the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above for a discussion of restricted share units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  The amounts in this column are the number of underlying stock options awarded to each executive officer in 2018 under the  LTIP. The options have a maximum term of ten years, vest evenly at one-third per year on each annual anniversary of the grant date and fully vest at three years. In the case of death, retirement, disability or  change in control combined with certain termination of employment, the options become 100% vested and exercisable for the remainder of their applicable term. See the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis beginning on page 18 above  for a discussion of stock options.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  The amounts reported in this column is the per share exercise price of the stock options, which represents the closing  price on the NYSE for the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  The amounts reported in this column were calculated as follows: (i) for performance share units granted on  February 21, 2018, the grant date value of $22.01 per share was multiplied by the number of performance share units awarded; (ii) for restricted share units granted on February 21, 2018, the grant date value of $22.01 per share was  multiplied by the number of restricted share units awarded; and (iii) for stock options granted on February 21, 2018, the grant date value of $10.94 per option was multiplied by the number of stock options. The performance share unit  awards and the restricted share unit awards are valued at the closing market price of Ferro's Common Stock on the date of the grant reduced by the discounted value of expected interest on the dividends associated with these shares. The fair  value of each stock option on the grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing method, as further described on page 91 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year  ended December 31, 2018. See also footnotes 3 and 4 to the Summary Compensation Table on page 32 above.

2018 Executive Compensation 
Post-Employment Compensation 
The following table sets forth the accumulated benefits under the DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan (collectively, the "DB Program") for each of the executives named in the Summary Compensation Table: 
Pension Benefits 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name  Plan Name  Number of Years of Credited Service  Present Value of Accumulated Benefit   Payments During Last Fiscal Year 
Name  Plan Name  Number of Years of Credited Service  Present Value of Accumulated Benefit   Payments During Last Fiscal Year 
 Peter T. Thomas(1)  DB Plan     7.0833      356,733      0  
 Benjamin  Schlater  —     —      —      —  
 Mark H.  Duesenberg  —     —      —      —  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  These amounts reflect Mr. Thomas's accumulated present values of his benefit under the DB Plan and his benefit  under the Supplemental DB Plan, each as of the applicable measurement date of December 31, 2018, used for financial reporting purposes for the 2018 fiscal year. Mr. Thomas is fully vested in his DB Program benefit because he has more than  the required five years of service for vesting purposes. His credited service is limited to 7.0833 years due to the freeze of the DB Program on March 31, 2006 (including a freeze on credited service used to calculate the amount of his benefits  under the DB Program). The "Present Value of Accumulated Benefit" was calculated based on certain assumptions made by the Company's actuaries, including those regarding discount rate and mortality, which are consistent with DB Program  disclosures. As a result of the differences in assumptions and methodology between the SEC's rules for disclosure and the terms of the Supplemental DB Plan (which involve different calculation dates, interest rates and mortality assumptions),  the present value of Mr. Thomas's accumulated benefits in this table is not the same as the present value of his Supplemental DB Plan benefits that actually would have been paid to him under the terms of the Supplemental DB Plan using the  measurement date of December 31, 2018. In addition, Mr. Thomas's DB Plan benefit will not be payable to him in the form of a lump sum.  
[END TABLE]
Under the DB Program, an eligible participant who retires at age 65 with at least 30 years of service will receive a monthly benefit equal to 50% of the monthly average of the participant's highest five consecutive calendar years of compensation (which includes base salary and certain incentive payouts), reduced for 50% of the monthly primary social security benefits. Benefits are subject to reduction for service of less than 30 years and for commencement prior to age 65 (age 60 for certain eligible elected officers). Service in excess of 30 years is not taken into account for accrual of retirement benefits. DB Plan benefits are payable in a life annuity form with 120 monthly payments guaranteed ("Life Annuity"). Depending on the outcome of a participant's benefit calculations, and consistent with the plan document and Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, Supplemental DB Plan benefits may be payable in a Life Annuity and/or those benefits may be commuted and paid in one or two lump sum payments. Furthermore, the benefits payable under the Supplemental DB Plan to an eligible participant are conditioned upon the execution of, and compliance with, a non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality agreement. 
The Company's United States defined benefit pension program for salaried and certain hourly employees was significantly changed in 2003 and 2006. Effective July 1, 2003, new hires were not eligible for participation in the DB Program. In addition, effective March 31, 2006, benefits accrued for active employees who were participating in the DB Program were frozen. (This freeze did not affect the benefits of then-current retirees, former employees or employees hired on or after July 1, 2003.) Beginning April 1, 2006, the affected employees joined salaried and certain hourly employees in the United States who were hired on or after July 1, 2003, in receiving an additional basic pension contribution each year from the Company under the 401(k) Plan, and as executives, they are also eligible to receive the supplemental basic pension contribution under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
Messrs. Schlater and Duesenberg, each of whom was hired after June 30, 2003, were never eligible for participation in the DB Program. Of the executives listed in the Summary Compensation Table, only Mr. Thomas participated in these plans during 2018 because he was hired before July 1, 2003. See the Change in Pension Value and Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 32 above for information regarding the change in value of Mr. Thomas's benefits under the DB Program for 2018.

[END TABLE]
The non-qualified deferred compensation plans in this table consist of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental 401(k) Plan. There are no Company Contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan and, among the executive officers and former executive officer listed in this table, none had an account balance as of December 31, 2018. 
Under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, participants may receive a supplemental matching contribution and/or a supplemental basic pension contribution. These are primarily contributions that would have been made to the account of a participant in the 401(k) Plan but for the application of Federal tax law limitations. In addition, any AIP payments are included in the calculation of supplemental basic pension contributions. There are no employee contributions under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan. Under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, each executive officer listed in this table had an account balance as of December 31, 2018. 
The Supplemental 401(k) Plan permits participants the option of a deemed investment in either Company Common Stock or the stable asset fund under the 401(k) Plan. During 2018, all of the Company's contributions under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan were deemed invested in Company Common Stock for the NEOs, and earnings include any deemed dividends, gains and losses. No actual shares of Company Common Stock are held by the Supplemental 401(k) Plan. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
Termination and Change in Control Payments 
Executive Separation Policy 
The Compensation Committee has approved a formal separation policy for certain senior executives, including the CEO. The policy outlines the expected separation payments to certain senior executives if their employment is terminated without "cause" or if an executive officer terminates his or her employment for "good reason." Under the policy, eligible senior executives will receive the following benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to 24 months of salary and target level bonus in the case of the CEO or 18 months of salary and  target level bonus for certain other senior executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A pro-rated bonus for the portion of the year of termination that the executive  officer was employed based on actual performance against bonus plan targets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continuation of health benefits for 24 months for the CEO or 18 months for certain other executive officers; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Outplacement services for 24 months in an amount not to exceed $25,000 in the aggregate for the CEO or 12 months in an  amount not to exceed $10,000 in the aggregate for certain other executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Payments are designed to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Separation benefits under the policy are payable only if (i) the executive officer has executed an agreement for non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-disparagement (and, if specified by the Company, arbitration) and a release of all claims (other than those that cannot be waived) that the executive may have against the Company, its officers, fiduciaries, Directors, agents and employees and (ii) the executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance and cooperation with the Company concerning business or legal related matters about which the executive possesses relevant knowledge or information. The Compensation Committee may modify or terminate this policy from time to time; however, any modification or termination will not affect the rights of any executive whose termination or departure preceded such modification or termination. 
Additional Termination Payments 
While the Executive Separation Policy governs the separation pay and benefits that the Company will provide to executive officers if their employment with the Company terminates under certain circumstances, an executive officer may also receive payments under the AIP, the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, the DB Plan, the Supplemental DB Plan and the LTIP. 
AIP. The AIP provides an executive with an opportunity to earn additional cash compensation based upon the achievement of pre-determined financial goals for the fiscal year. See the Annual Incentive Plan discussion of the Executive Compensation & Discussion Analysis beginning on page 18 above for a discussion of this plan. If an executive's employment is terminated without "cause" or if an executive officer terminates his or her employment for "good reason," then the policy will provide for any AIP-related payments. In other termination situations, payment of any AIP is governed by the AIP itself. Under the AIP, if the executive's employment terminates as a result of retirement or death prior to the end of the year, the executive will receive a prorated AIP payout based on his or her annual rate of base salary at retirement or death, as applicable, and actual AIP results for that year (provided that the executive worked for a minimum of three months during the plan year) or, in other termination situations, the executive will not receive any AIP payment for the year in which his or her employment terminates. 
Supplemental 401(k) Plan. The executives are eligible to participate in the Supplemental 401(k) Plan. See Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation on page 39 above for a discussion of this plan. If an executive's employment terminates for any reason, he or she will receive the portion, if any, of his or her account that had vested prior to January 1, 2005 (plus earnings) soon after the end of the month in which the termination occurs, and any remaining vested portion of his or her account will be paid the first day of the seventh month following the termination of employment. Each executive's account vests 20% per year, with full vesting upon the completion of 
2018 Executive Compensation five years of employment. Alternatively, the executive's account fully vests upon attainment of age 65, disability, death or a change in control. If the executive dies on the date of termination or during the six months following termination, the payment will be made as of the date of death. The form of the payment, whether stock or cash, is dependent upon the executive's election. If his or her employment with the Company terminated as of December 31, 2018, each executive would have been entitled to receive the following amount under the Supplemental 401(k) Plan: Mr. Thomas ($2,101,592), Duesenberg ($543,025) and Mr. Schlater ($58,053). 
DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan. Mr. Thomas is the only executive named in the Summary Compensation Table who participates in the DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan because these plans are available only to executives who were hired prior to July 1, 2003 (when the DB Plan was frozen as to new hires). If Mr. Thomas's employment terminates, under the Supplemental DB Plan, he would receive the portion, if any, of his benefit under the plans that had vested prior to January 1, 2005 (or he could begin the payment of that benefit in the form of an annuity) soon after the end of the month in which the termination occurs, and any remaining vested portion of his account will be paid in a lump sum the first day of the seventh month following the termination of his employment. If Mr. Thomas's employment had terminated on December 31, 2018, then his estimated benefit under the Supplemental DB Plan would have been $167,000. In addition, if Mr. Thomas's employment had terminated on December 31, 2018, he would receive a benefit under the DB Plan in the form of an annuity, with 120 monthly payments guaranteed, beginning as early as January 1, 2019, in the gross amount of $1,878.31 per month (which includes a reduction for early commencement). Benefit Accruals under both the DB Plan and the Supplemental DB Plan (including those of Mr. Thomas) were frozen on March 31, 2006. See Post-Employment Compensation on page 38 for a discussion of these plans. 
LTIP. The executives are also eligible to participate in the LTIP. (See the discussion of Long-Term Incentives in the Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis on page 21 above for a description of the LTIP.) The LTIP allows the Company to award different types of long-term incentives; however, the Compensation Committee has only awarded stock options, performance shares, performance share units, restricted shares and restricted share units. For stock options, if an executive leaves the Company under the Executive Separation Policy or for any reason other than a change in control, death, disability or retirement, he or she has three months to exercise stock options that were vested as of the date of separation and any options that were not vested as of the date of separation from service are forfeited. If there is a change in control (whether or not the executive is terminated) or the executive leaves the Company as a result of death, disability or retirement, all options previously awarded to such executive are fully vested and remain exercisable for the rest of the applicable option exercise period. 
Performance share units were granted under the LTIP to certain executives in 2018, 2017, and 2016. If an executive leaves the Company under the Executive Separation Policy or for any reason other than a change in control, death, disability or retirement, then he or she is entitled to the value of the performance share units that have vested for completed performance periods, which will be provided to the executive in the form of a cash payment equal to 50% of the value of the performance share units and the other 50% will be in the form of Common Stock. Any performance share units for any performance period that has not been completed are forfeited. If the executive leaves as a result of death, disability or retirement, the executive will receive prorated vesting of performance share units, if earned, for performance periods that have not been completed as of the date of separation, which will be provided to the executive after the end of the performance period in the form of a cash payment equal to 50% of the value of the performance share units and the other 50% will be in the form of Common Stock. 
Restricted share units were granted under the LTIP to certain executives in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Those restricted share units vest three years from the date of the grant and then are subject to a two-year holding period. If the executive leaves during the three-year vesting period other than due to death, disability or a change in control, then the restricted share units are forfeited. If the executive leaves during the three-year vesting period due to death, disability or a change in control, then the restricted share units will vest and the executive (or, in the case of death, the applicable recipient) will receive the restricted share units. See Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis on page 21 for a discussion of restricted share units. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
Except as expressly provided otherwise in an applicable award agreement or change in control agreement, awards granted under the LTIP since 2014 have a "double trigger" change in control provision, which means that the vesting of awards will not accelerate upon a change in control unless the acquiring company does not assume the awards or, if they are assumed, the acquiring company terminates the participant's employment within the 24 month period following the consummation of the change in control other than for cause. 
The table below shows the estimated value of the payments under the LTIP for each of the executives named in the Summary Compensation Table if they had left the Company on December 31, 2018:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Payments for stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units and performance share units upon termination  following a change in control are set forth in the Estimated Change in Control Payments table on page 45 below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Executives will not receive any payments for stock options in the event of the executive's resignation or  termination by the Company (other than by reason of a change in control) because the executives would not have received accelerated vesting of any stock options. Generally, restricted shares, restricted share units and performance share units are  forfeited upon the executive's resignation or termination by the Company (other than by reason of a change in control).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Certain of the Company's award agreements contain provisions that provide for full or partial vesting of awards if a  participant age 55 or more with ten or more years experience retires. Stock options fully vest as of the date of retirement. Performance share units will be earned on a pro rata basis and will be paid out at the end of the vesting period. Beginning  in 2019, restricted share units will have a similar provision. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Duesenberg are the only officers listed in the table who would have been eligible for accelerated vesting of awards, as they are the only officers who would  have been eligible for retirement on December 31, 2018. The stock option amounts in the retirement column show the value of additional stock options that would have vested for each executive if the executive's employment had terminated due  to retirement and is based on the difference between the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of  in-the-money accelerated stock options. Amounts shown for performance share units reflect the pro rata portion of the awards which would vest upon retirement and be paid  out at the end of the performance period assuming performance is at target.  
[END TABLE]
2018 Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The stock option amounts in the death or disability column show the value of additional stock options that would have  vested for each executive if the executive's employment had terminated due to disability or death and is based on the difference between the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of in-the-money accelerated stock options. The restricted share and restricted share unit amounts in this column consist of the restricted shares or restricted share units that  are not fully vested on December 31, 2018 which would have received accelerated full vesting upon death or disability on that date. The performance share unit amounts in these columns equal the estimated amounts for the prorated portion of the  2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance periods valued using the closing share price of the Company's Common Stock on December 31, 2018, and assuming that the target performance had been obtained.  
[END TABLE]
Change in Control Payments 
The Company currently has change in control agreements (the "Change in Control Agreements") with each of Messrs. Thomas, Schlater and Duesenberg. The purpose of these agreements is to reinforce and encourage each officer's continued attention and dedication to his or her assigned duties without distraction in the face of solicitations by other employers and the potentially disruptive circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. 
In connection with Mr. Thomas's appointment as the interim President and CEO, the Company agreed to make certain changes to his then-existing change in control agreement. Pursuant to his current change in control agreement, if a change in control of the Company occurs, (a) Mr. Thomas is entitled to a severance payment equal to three times his full year's compensation (base salary plus bonus at the targeted amount) and continued participation in Ferro's employee benefit programs for up to 36 months, (b) the agreement uses a definition of "Good Reason," which does not include a voluntary resignation during the 90-day period commencing on the first anniversary of the change in control, and (c) the agreement does not provide for an excise tax "gross-up;" but instead, provides Mr. Thomas with benefits equal to the greater of (i) the payments under the agreement net of any excise taxes; or (ii) $1 less than the amount of payment that would trigger the application of excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code. 
Under the form of Change in Control Agreement, if a change in control of the Company occurs, then the following will happen: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the executive's employment is terminated for any reason other than by the Company for cause, by reason of  the executive's death or retirement or by the executive without good reason, the Company would be obligated to:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Pay the executive a lump sum severance payment equal to two times (three times with respect to Mr. Thomas) the  executive's full-year compensation (base salary plus bonus at the targeted amount) (the "Termination Payment");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Provide the executive with continued participation in Ferro's employee benefit programs for up to 24 months (36  months with respect to Mr. Thomas), except in the event of the executive's death;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Pay the executive a lump sum amount in cash equal to the pro rata portion of the executive's annual bonus for the  calendar year in which the date of termination occurs (if that termination date occurs in a calendar year following the calendar year in which the change in control occurs);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Pay the executive a lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of (i) the present value of the excess of the benefits  that would have been paid or payable to the executive under any defined-benefit retirement plan in which the executive participates had he or she remained employed by Ferro for an additional 24 months (36 months with respect to Mr. Thomas) over  the benefits that are payable at the time of termination plus (ii) the contributions that Ferro would have been required to make under any defined-contribution retirement plan over the 24 months (36 months with respect to Mr. Thomas)  following termination;  
[END TABLE]
2018 Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Provide the services of an outplacement firm; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Maintain the executive's indemnification insurance for at least four years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the executive's employment is terminated by reason of death, the Company will be obligated to:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Pay the executive's estate a lump sum severance payment equal to the Termination Payment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Pay the executive's estate a lump sum amount in cash equal to the pro rata portion of the executive's annual  bonus for the calendar year in which the date of termination occurred.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, within five days after the change in control occurs, the Company will be obligated to pay the executive (or, if applicable, the Executive's estate) an amount in cash (or stock if necessary for tax reasons related to the change in control) for each grant of performance shares previously awarded to the executive for any performance period that had not expired before the change in control (even if the performance period has not been completed as of the date of the change in control and regardless of whether or not the executive's employment was terminated). 
Finally, with respect only to Mr. Duesenberg, if any of the foregoing payments are subject to an excise tax, the Company will provide a payment to cover such tax, and with respect to all NEOs, the Company will pay the fees for tax advice for such NEOs in connection with determinations and calculations related to excise tax. 
These agreements limit the executives' right to compete against Ferro after the termination of employment for a period of 24 months after the date of termination in normal circumstances and 36 months following the date of termination if all of the following conditions are met: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company has not terminated the executive's employment because of disability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company provides written notice to the executive not later than two months after the date of termination that the  Company elects to impose the additional 12-month period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company pays the executive an aggregate amount equal to the executive's base salary for the calendar year of the  date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
Each Change in Control Agreement also includes a non-disparagement provision that is perpetual. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
The table below describes the estimated value of the payments each of the executives named in the Summary Compensation Table would have received if there had been a change in control and the executive's employment had been terminated as of December 31, 2018 (other than by the Company for cause, by reason of the executive's death or retirement or by the executive without good reason):

2018 Executive Compensation 
Director Compensation 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the amount and form of payment of Director compensation. A significantly larger portion of director compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards than in cash, and Directors must hold such awards until they cease to serve as a director. All of the directors hold equity with a value greater than the annual retainer and most hold equity with a value several times the annual retainer (the average is more than 10 times). In 2018, Directors were paid a quarterly retainer of $16,250 ($65,000 per annum) and were awarded 4,800 deferred stock units. The non-employee Directors do not receive a fee for attending meetings unless the total number of meetings a non-employee Director attends in a given year exceeds 24, in which case the non-employee Director would be paid $1,500 for each meeting in excess of 24. The Chairs of the Audit, Compensation and Governance & Nomination Committees were also each paid an additional quarterly fee of $5,000 ($20,000 per annum). The Lead Director receives an additional quarterly fee of $6,250 ($25,000 per annum). Directors' fees and other compensation for 2018 were:

(5)  Mr. Thomas is not paid any additional fees for his services as a Director because he is an employee of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
Directors may defer their fees and Common Stock issuable upon settlement of the deferred stock units into the Ferro Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts so deferred are invested in shares of Common Stock, and dividends, if any, on those shares are reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock. Ferro distributes the shares of Common Stock credited to a Director's deferred account after he or she ceases to be a Director. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
Deferred stock units awarded annually to the Directors vest immediately at the time of the award; however, the deferred stock units are held for the account of each Director and are not converted into shares of Ferro Common Stock until such Director ceases to serve as a Director of the Company. The Company believes the requirement to hold the deferred stock units until cessation of service further aligns the interests of the Directors and shareholders. Upon cessation of the Director's service as a Director, one share of Common Stock will be delivered for each deferred stock unit held. During the period between the vesting of the deferred stock unit and the delivery of the shares of Common Stock, the Director will not be entitled to exercise any voting rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock that correspond to the deferred stock units, but the Director will be entitled to receive a cash payment equivalent to any cash distributions or dividends paid on Common Stock with respect to the deferred stock units during such period. 
Proposal Two 
PROPOSAL TWO: 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis" and in the compensation tables and narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables, the Company's compensation program for the NEOs is designed to attract, motivate and retain talented executives who will provide leadership for the Company's success. Under this program, the NEOs are rewarded for individual and collective contributions to the Company consistent with a "pay for performance" orientation. Furthermore, the executive officer compensation program is aligned with the nature and dynamics of the Company's business, which focuses management on achieving the Company's annual and long-term business strategies and objectives. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the executive compensation program to ensure that it achieves the desired goals of emphasizing long-term value creation and aligning the interests of management and shareholders through the use of equity-based awards. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders expressed their support for our executive compensation policies and practices in our non-binding advisory vote on the executive compensation, with approximately 96% of the votes cast approving the executive compensation of our NEOs. The Board of Directors has determined, and shareholders have approved, holding the advisory vote on executive compensation each year. 
The Company is asking the shareholders to indicate their support for the Company's NEO compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the Company asks the shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure." 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering the Company's executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers. 
Vote Required for Approval 
Although the vote is non-binding, the Company will consider the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal as approval of the compensation of the Company's NEOs. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast on the proposal and will not have a positive or negative effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs. Unless you instruct otherwise on your proxy card or by telephone or Internet voting instructions, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. 
Proposal Three 
PROPOSAL THREE: 
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
Deloitte & Touche LLP served as the independent registered public accounting firm to the Company in 2018 and is expected to be retained to serve in such capacity in 2019. The Board of Directors has directed that management submit the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Shareholder ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the Company's Code of Regulations or otherwise. However, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain the firm. In such event, the Audit Committee may retain Deloitte & Touche LLP, notwithstanding that the shareholders did not ratify the selection, or select another nationally recognized accounting firm without re-submitting the matter to the shareholders. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee reserves the right in its discretion to select a different nationally recognized accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Vote Required for Approval 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Unless you instruct otherwise on your proxy card or by telephone or Internet voting instructions, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. 
Accounting Firm Information 
ACCOUNTING FIRM INFORMATION 
Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has sole responsibility for appointing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, but will consider the outcome of the shareholder vote on ratification of any appointment. 
Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2006. In accordance with its responsibilities under its charter and the NYSE listing standards, the Audit Committee will assess periodically the advisability of rotating audit firms for audits in future years. The lead engagement partner from Deloitte & Touche LLP is required to be rotated every five years. As part of the process for selecting a new lead engagement partner, candidates for that role met with senior management and with the Chair of the Audit Committee. Discussions regarding the appointment were held with the full Audit Committee prior to the Audit Committee selecting the new lead engagement partner. 
In recommending to the Board of Directors for submission to the shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee took into consideration several factors, including Deloitte's tenure, reports of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") on Deloitte and Deloitte's fees and performance. Representatives of Deloitte will attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Fees 
The Audit Committee has sole responsibility, in consultation with management, for approving the terms and fees for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for audits of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee has sole responsibility for determining whether and under what circumstances the Company's independent registered public accounting firm may be engaged to perform audit-related and non-audit services and must pre-approve any audit-related and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm consistent with applicable regulations. Under no circumstance is the Company's independent registered public accounting firm permitted to perform services of the nature described in Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates billed or will bill the Company fees as follows:

The Audit Committee charter describes in greater detail the full responsibilities of the Committee. During each fiscal year, the Audit Committee reviews the Company's consolidated financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, audit matters and reports from management. In connection with these reviews, the Audit Committee meets with management, internal auditors and Ferro's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, at least once each quarter. These meetings include executive sessions in which the Audit Committee meets separately with the independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management personnel. 
In performing these functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses the quarterly and annual audited consolidated financial statements with management, the Company's internal auditors and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm prior to their issuance. In its oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, preparing the consolidated financial statements and other reports and maintaining policies relating to legal and regulatory compliance, ethics and conflicts of interest. Deloitte & Touche LLP is responsible for performing an independent audit of the annual consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with Ferro's management and Deloitte & Touche LLP the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP all matters required to be discussed pursuant to auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communications of Deloitte & Touche LLP concerning independence and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence. 
Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in Ferro's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Recommendations and Nominations of Directors and Shareholder Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOMINATIONS OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
Recommending a Candidate for our Board of Directors 
The Governance & Nomination Committee will consider candidates for Director who are recommended by shareholders in accordance with the advance notice provisions in the Company's Code of Regulations. Shareholder recommendations must be submitted in writing to: Secretary, Ferro Corporation, 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124 USA. Shareholders may recommend candidates to be considered by the Committee at any time; however, for a candidate to be considered for election at an annual shareholders meeting, the notice must be received not less than 90 or more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders. Based on the currently scheduled date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, for a shareholder's candidate to be considered for nomination for election at the 2020 Annual Shareholders Meeting, notice must be received no earlier than January 3, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020 to be timely. The recommendation notice should include the information required by the Code of Regulations, including, but not limited to, (a) certain biographical and share ownership information concerning the nominee and the shareholder proponent, (b) a description of any arrangements between the shareholder proponent (and certain affiliates) and any other person or entity with respect to the nomination, including the nominee, and (c) a written consent of the nominee to serve as a Director of the Company, if elected, and a representation regarding the nominee's voting commitments or actions as a Director, as well as that the nominee will comply with the Company's corporate governance and other policies, principles and guidelines. The Company may also require a candidate to furnish additional information regarding his or her eligibility and qualifications. 
Nominating a Person for Election as a Director under our Proxy Access Provisions 
The Company's Code of Regulations contains a proxy access provision that permits an "eligible shareholder" who complies with the provision to nominate one or more individuals for election to the Board of Directors at an annual shareholders' meeting and to have the nomination included in the Company's proxy statement for that meeting. An "eligible shareholder" is a record or beneficial owner (or group of up to 20 record and/or beneficial owners) who owns and has owned continuously for at least 3 years at least 3% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally for the election of Directors. A shareholder cannot be a part of more than one group nominating individuals for any particular annual meeting. The proxy access provision includes rules to determine whether a record or beneficial holder "owns" the capital stock of the company for purposes of the proxy access provision and addresses the treatment of loaned shares and hedging transactions. 
To nominate a nominee, among other requirements that are set forth in the Code of Regulations, an Eligible Shareholder must submit a nomination notice no earlier than 150 calendar days and no later than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the date that the Company commenced mailing or otherwise sending its proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders. With respect to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the notice must be received no earlier than October 23, 2019 or later than November 22, 2019. For any nomination to be timely under the proxy access provision, the company must receive by the deadline the shareholder nomination and all required information and documentation described in the proxy access provision, and any supporting statement of 500 words or less that the Eligible Shareholder wished to be included in the proxy statement. Shareholder nominations and related documentation should be sent to the Secretary at our principal executive offices located at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124. 
The proxy access provision has a number of limitations and requirements related to Director nominations by eligible shareholders, which can be found in our Code of Regulations. 
Recommendations and Nominations of Directors and Shareholder Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting 
Making a Shareholder Proposal 
Any shareholder who intends to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting may do so in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 14a-8. Any such shareholder proposal must delivered to the Company at our headquarters at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124, not later than November 22, 2019, and must otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the advance notice provisions in the Regulations. 
Any shareholder who intends to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting other than for inclusion in Ferro's proxy statement and form of proxy must comply with the advance notice provisions in the Regulations. Among other requirements, these provisions require that such shareholder deliver the proposal to Ferro at our headquarters at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124, not less than 90 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting. Otherwise, such proposal will be untimely. Based on the scheduled date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, a proposal for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be delivered no earlier than January 3, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020 to be timely. Ferro reserves the right to exercise discretionary voting authority on the proposal if a shareholder submits the proposal earlier than January 3, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020.

By Telephone: You may call the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card. Follow the simple instructions and use the personalized control number specified on your proxy card to vote your shares.

Over the Internet: You may visit the website indicated on your proxy card. Follow the simple instructions and use the personalized control number specified on your proxy card to vote your shares. You will be able to confirm that your vote has been properly recorded.

By Mail: You may mark, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
If I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote? 
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name." The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. Notice of electronic availability of proxy materials, including voting instructions, should be forwarded to you by that organization. If you request printed copies of these proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form. 
General Information 
If I am a participant in the Ferro Corporation 401(k) Plan, how do I vote? 
If you are a participant in the Ferro Corporation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan"), you have the right to instruct Great-West Trust Company, LLC, as Trustee, to vote the shares allocated to your Plan account. If you do not give voting instructions or if your voting instructions are not received by the deadline shown on the enclosed voting instruction form, the Trustee will vote your and other participants' uninstructed shares in the same proportion in which it has received timely voting instructions from other participants for all shares held in the Plan.

Banks and brokers have the authority under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions on certain routine matters. The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter for which banks and brokers may vote without specific instructions from their customers. You must provide voting instructions to your bank or broker for your shares to be voted on all other matters presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
If you are a participant in the Plan and do not instruct Great-West Trust Company, LLC, as Trustee, to vote the shares allocated to your Plan account, or if your voting instructions are not received by the deadline shown on the enclosed voting instruction form, the Trustee will vote the uninstructed shares in the same proportion in which it has received timely voting instructions.

Note 
Under rules of the Securities Exchange Commission, to minimize mailing costs we are permitted to send a single set of annual reports and proxy statements to any household at which two or more shareholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. A number of brokerage firms have also instituted this practice with respect to the delivery of documents to shareholders residing at the same address. With this practice, however, each shareholder continues to receive a separate proxy card for voting. Any shareholder affected by this practice who desires to receive multiple copies of annual reports and proxy statements in the future may write or call Investor Relations at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 250, Mayfield Heights, Ohio 44124, Attention: Investor Relations, telephone 216.875.5400.
