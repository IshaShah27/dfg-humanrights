(the "Company" or "DPW"), for use at the Special Meeting of the Company's stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on February 28, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. PT at the Hyatt Regency Hotel Newport Beach, located at 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach, CA 92660.

To enter the Meeting, you must have your control number that is shown on the proxy card accompanying this Proxy Statement.
Action to be taken under Proxy
Unless otherwise directed by the giver of the proxy, the persons named in the form of proxy, namely, Milton C. Ault, III, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and William B. Horne, our Chief Financial Officer, or either one of them who acts, will vote FOR approval of an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") to effect a reverse stock split of our Class A Common Stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more than one-for-twenty (the "Reverse Stock Split") at any time prior to February 28, 2020, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by the Board in its sole discretion.
 Should any nominee named herein for election as a director become unavailable for any reason, it is intended that the persons named in the proxy will vote for the election of such other person in his stead as may be designated by the Board. The Board is not aware of any reason that might cause any nominee to be unavailable.
By submitting your proxy (via the Internet, telephone or mail), you authorize Mr. Milton C. "Todd" Ault, III, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. William B. Horne, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, to represent you and vote your shares at the meeting in accordance with your instructions. They also may vote your shares to adjourn the meeting and will be authorized to vote your shares at any postponements or adjournments of the meeting.
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. WHETHER OR NOT YOU PLAN TO LOG INTO THE MEETING, PLEASE PROMPTLY VOTE YOUR SHARES OVER THE INTERNET, BY TELEPHONE OR BY MAIL.
Who is Entitled to Vote; Vote Required; Quorum
As of the Record Date of January 22, 2019, there were 93,164,738 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 125,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, which constitute all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by them. The 125,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock carry the voting power of 1.88% of all votes entitled to be voted at the Meeting.
A majority of the 94,950,452 outstanding shares of capital stock will constitute a quorum at the Meeting.
Brokers holding shares of record for customers generally are not entitled to vote on "non-routine" matters, unless they receive voting instructions from their customers. As used herein, "uninstructed shares" means shares held by a broker who has not received such instructions from its customers on a proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding uninstructed shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that non-routine matter. In connection with the treatment of abstentions and broker non-votes, the proposal at this Meeting is considered a "routine" matter, and brokers are entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect to such proposal.
For the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split, the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock is required for approval. Abstentions will be considered shares present by proxy and entitled to vote and, therefore, will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. 
Directions to withhold authority to vote for directors, abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the Meeting.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING

The proxy card enables you to appoint Milton C. "Todd" Ault, III, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and William B. Horne, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, as your representative at the Meeting. By completing and returning a proxy card, you are authorizing these individuals to vote your shares at the Meeting in accordance with your instructions on the proxy card.

If you are a registered stockholder and attend the meeting, then you may deliver your completed proxy card(s) or vote in person. If your shares are held by your broker or bank, in "street name", then you will receive a form from your broker or bank seeking instructions as to how your shares should be voted. If you do not instruct your broker or bank how to vote, then your broker or bank will vote your shares if it has discretionary power to vote on a particular matter.
Am I entitled to vote if my shares are held in "street name"?
If your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name." If your shares are held in street name, the proxy materials are being made available to you by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee (the "record holder"), along with voting instructions. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your record holder how to vote your shares, and the record holder is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions.
As the beneficial owner of shares, you are invited to log in to the Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, however, you may not vote your shares at the meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares.
You will be able to attend the Meeting, vote, and submit your questions during the meeting via live webcast by visiting www.proxyvote.com if you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in "street" name and at www.investorvote.com/DPW if you are a registered holder.
How many shares must be present to hold the meeting?
A quorum must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of capital stock outstanding on the Record Date will constitute a quorum. Proxies received but marked as abstentions or treated as broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.
What if a quorum is not present at the meeting?
If a quorum is not present or represented at the meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting who are present in person or represented by proxy, or the chairman of the meeting, may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is present or represented. The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice will be given.
Is there a deadline for submitting proxies electronically or by telephone or mail? 
Proxies submitted electronically or by telephone as described above must be received by 11:59 pm PT on February 27, 2019. Proxies submitted by mail should be received before 9:00 a.m. PT on February 28, 2019.
Can I revoke my proxy and change my vote?
You may change your vote at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the meeting. If you are the stockholder of record, you may change your vote by (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the methods described above (and until the applicable deadline for each method), (2) providing a written notice of revocation to the Company's CEO at DPW Holdings, Inc., 201 Shipyard Way, Newport Beach, CA 92663, prior to your shares being voted, or (3) attending the meeting and voting. Attendance at the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request. For shares you hold beneficially in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank, trustee or nominee following the instructions they provided, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank, trustee or nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting.
Who can participate in the meeting?
Only stockholders eligible to vote or their authorized representatives in possession of a valid control number will be admitted as participants to the meeting.
Will my vote be kept confidential?
Yes, your vote will be kept confidential and not disclosed to the Company unless:
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on the proposals?
Our Board recommends that you vote your shares "FOR" approval of an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") to effect a reverse stock split of our Class A Common Stock by a ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more than one-for-twenty at any time prior to February 28, 2020, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by the Board in its sole discretion
Unless you provide other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board as set forth in this Proxy Statement.
What if I do not specify how my shares are to be voted?
If you return a signed and dated proxy card without marking any voting selections, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommended votes set forth immediately above, and if any other matter is properly presented at the meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his best judgment.
Will any other business be conducted at the meeting?
The Company's bylaws require stockholders to give advance notice of any proposal intended to be presented at the meeting. The deadline for this notice has passed and we have not received any such notices. If any other matter properly comes before the stockholders for a vote at the meeting, however, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment.
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
Approval of the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation requires the favorable vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock.
How will abstentions be treated?
Abstentions will be treated as shares present for quorum purposes and entitled to vote, and will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
What are "broker non-votes"?
Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed "non-routine." Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker or nominee can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters. Under the rules and interpretations of the New York Stock Exchange, "non-routine" matters include director elections (whether contested or uncontested) and matters involving a contest or a matter that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders.
In connection with the treatment of abstentions and broker non-votes, the proposals at this meeting to approve the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split is considered a "routine" matter, and brokers are entitled to vote uninstructed shares with respect to these proposals.
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these mailed proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means of communication. The Board has engaged Kingsdale Advisors to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $8,100, plus an additional per holder fee for any solicitation of individual holders and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies but may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation. We will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
If you receive more than one set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in different accounts. Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
I share the same address with another stockholder of the Company. Why has our household only received one set of proxy materials?
The Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") rules permit us to deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This practice, known as "householding," is intended to reduce the Company's printing and postage costs. We have delivered only one set of proxy materials to stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record and share a single address, unless we received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Meeting?
Final voting results will be disclosed in a Form 8-K filed after the Meeting.
Who can help answer my questions?
You can contact our corporate headquarters, at DPW Holdings, Inc., 201 Shipyard Way, Newport Beach, CA 92663, by sending a letter to Milton C. "Todd" Ault, III, our Chief Executive Officer, with any questions about the proposal described in this proxy statement or how to execute your vote. In addition, you can also contact:

PROPOSAL 
 AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF COMMON STOCK
Our Board has adopted resolutions (1) declaring that submitting an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split, as described below, was advisable and (2) directing that a proposal to approve the Reverse Stock Split be submitted to the holders of our Common Stock for their approval.
The form of the proposed amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split will be substantially as set forth on Annex A (subject to any changes required by applicable law).  If approved by our stockholders, the Reverse Stock Split proposal would permit (but not require) our Board to effect a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at any time prior to February 28, 2020 by a ratio of not less than one-for-four and not more than one-for-twenty, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within this range as determined by our Board in its sole discretion.  We believe that enabling our Board to set the ratio within the stated range will provide us with the flexibility to implement the Reverse Stock Split in a manner designed to maximize the anticipated benefits for our stockholders.  In determining a ratio, if any, following the receipt of stockholder approval, our Board may consider, among other things, factors such as:
Our Board reserves the right to elect to abandon the Reverse Stock Split, including any or all proposed reverse stock split ratios, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Reverse Stock Split is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Depending on the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split determined by our Board, no less than four and no more than twenty shares of existing Common Stock, as determined by our Board, will be combined into one share of Common Stock.  The amendment to our Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split, if any, will include only the reverse split ratio determined by our Board to be in the best interests of our stockholders and all of the other proposed amendments at different ratios will be abandoned.
To avoid the existence of fractional shares of our Common Stock, the Company will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares as described below.
Background and Reasons for the Reverse Stock Split; Potential Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split
Our Board is submitting the Reverse Stock Split to our stockholders for approval with the primary intent of increasing the market price of our Common Stock to enhance our ability to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American and to make our Common Stock more attractive to a broader range of institutional and other investors.  In addition to increasing the market price of our Common Stock, the Reverse Stock Split would also reduce certain of our costs, as discussed below.  Accordingly, for these and other reasons discussed below, we believe that effecting the Reverse Stock Split is in the Company's and our stockholders' best interests.
We believe that the Reverse Stock Split will enhance our ability to maintain our on the NYSE American.  Reducing the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock should, absent other  factors, increase the per share market price of our Common Stock, although we cannot provide any assurance that our minimum bid price would remain following the Reverse Stock Split over the minimum bid price requirement of the NYSE American.
Additionally, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split will make our Common Stock more attractive to a broader range of institutional and other investors, as we have been advised that the current market price of our Common Stock may affect its acceptability to certain institutional investors, professional investors and other members of the investing public.  Many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced stocks to their customers.  In addition, some of those policies and practices may function to make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers.  Moreover, because brokers' commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, the current average price per share of Common Stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were substantially higher.  We believe that the Reverse Stock Split will make our Common Stock a more attractive and cost effective investment for many investors, which will enhance the liquidity of the holders of our Common Stock.
Reducing the number of outstanding shares of our Common Stock through the Reverse Stock Split is intended, absent other factors, to increase the per share market price of our Common Stock.  However, other factors, such as our financial results, market conditions and the market perception of our business may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split, if completed, will result in the intended benefits described above, that the market price of our Common Stock will increase following the Reverse Stock Split or that the market price of our Common Stock will not decrease in the future.  Additionally, we cannot assure you that the market price per share of our Common Stock after a Reverse Stock Split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding before the Reverse Stock Split.  Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the Reverse Stock Split.
Procedure for Implementing the Reverse Stock Split
The Reverse Stock Split, if approved by our stockholders, would become effective upon the filing (the "Effective Time") of a certificate of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.  The exact timing of the filing of the certificate of amendment that will effectuate the Reverse Stock Split will be determined by our Board based on its evaluation as to when such action will be the most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders.  In addition, our Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval and without further action by the stockholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing the amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, our Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split.  If a certificate of amendment effectuating the Reverse Stock Split has not been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware by the close of business on February 28, 2020, our Board will abandon the Reverse Stock Split.
Effect of the Reverse Stock Split on Holders of Outstanding Common Stock
Depending on the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split determined by our Board, a minimum of four and a maximum of twenty shares of existing Common Stock will be combined into one new share of Common Stock.  The table below shows, as of the Record Date, 2019, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding Treasury shares) that would result from the listed hypothetical reverse stock split ratios (without giving effect to the treatment of fractional shares):
The actual number of shares issued after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, will depend on the reverse stock split ratio that is ultimately determined by our Board.
The Reverse Stock Split will affect all holders of our Common Stock uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company, except that as described below in "Fractional Shares," record holders of Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares.  In addition, the Reverse Stock Split will not affect any stockholder's proportionate voting power (subject to the treatment of fractional shares).
The Reverse Stock Split may result in some stockholders owning "odd lots" of less than 100 shares of Common Stock.  Odd lot shares may be more difficult to sell, and brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in "round lots" of even multiples of 100 shares.
After the Effective Time, our Common Stock will have new Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) numbers, which is a number used to identify our equity securities, and stock certificates with the older CUSIP numbers will need to be exchanged for stock certificates with the new CUSIP numbers by following the procedures described below.  After the Reverse Stock Split, we will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our Common Stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE American under the symbol "DPW."
Beneficial Holders of Common Stock (i.e., stockholders who hold in street name)
Upon the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, we intend to treat shares held by stockholders through a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee in the same manner as registered stockholders whose shares are registered in their names.  Banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees will be instructed to effect the Reverse Stock Split for their beneficial holders holding our Common Stock in street name.  However, these banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees may have different procedures than registered stockholders for processing the Reverse Stock Split.  Stockholders who hold shares of our Common Stock with a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee and who have any questions in this regard are encouraged to contact their banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees.
Registered "Book-Entry" Holders of Common Stock (i.e., stockholders whose names are registered on the transfer agent's books and records but do not hold stock certificates)
Certain of our registered holders of Common Stock may hold some or all of their shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent.  These stockholders do not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership of the Common Stock.  They are, however, provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts.
Stockholders who hold shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent will not need to take action (the exchange will be automatic) to receive whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock, subject to adjustment for treatment of fractional shares.
Holders of Certificated Shares of Common Stock
Stockholders holding shares of our Common Stock in certificated form will be sent a transmittal letter by the Exchange Agent after the Effective Time. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions on how a stockholder should surrender his, her or its certificate(s) representing shares of our Common Stock (the "Old Certificates") to the transfer agent in exchange for certificates representing the appropriate number of whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock (the "New Certificates").
No new post-Reverse Split Common Stock will be issued to a stockholder until such stockholder has surrendered all Old Certificates, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, to the Exchange Agent. No stockholder will be required to pay a transfer or other fee to exchange his, her or its Old Certificates. Stockholders will then receive a Direct Registration Statement representing the number of whole shares of Common Stock that they are entitled as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, subject to the treatment of fractional shares described below. Until surrendered, we will deem outstanding Old Certificates held by stockholders to be cancelled and only to represent the number of whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split Common Stock to which these stockholders are entitled, subject to the treatment of fractional shares. Any Old Certificates submitted for exchange, whether because of a sale, transfer or other disposition of stock, will automatically be exchanged for post-Reverse Split Common Stock. If an Old Certificate has a restrictive legend on the back of the Old Certificate(s), a New Certificate will be issued with the same restrictive legends that are on the back of the Old Certificate(s).
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO.
Fractional Shares
Prevailing market prices
We will not issue fractional shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise hold fractional shares because the number of shares of Common Stock they hold before the Reverse Stock Split is not evenly divisible by the split ratio ultimately determined by the Board will be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from our Exchange Agent in lieu of such fractional shares. The cash payment is subject to applicable U.S. federal and state income tax and state abandoned property laws. Stockholders will not be entitled to receive interest for the period of time between the Effective Time and the date payment is received.
We currently anticipate that, in lieu of issuing fractional shares, the aggregate of all fractional shares otherwise issuable to the holders of record of Common Stock shall be issued to the Exchange Agent for the Common Stock, as agent, for the accounts of all holders of record of Common Stock otherwise entitled to have a fraction of a share issued to them. The sale of all fractional interests will be effected by the Exchange Agent as soon as practicable after the Effective Time on the basis of prevailing market prices of the Common Stock at the time of sale. After such sale and upon the surrender of the stockholders' stock certificates, if any, the Exchange Agent will pay to such holders of record their pro rata share of the net proceeds (after customary brokerage commissions and other expenses) derived from the sale of the fractional interests.
After the Reverse Stock Split, a stockholder will have no further interest in the Company with respect to its fractional share interest, and persons otherwise entitled to a fractional share will not have any voting, dividend or other rights with respect thereto except the right to receive a cash payment as described above. 
Effect of the Reverse Stock Split on Employee Plans, Options, Restricted Stock Awards, Warrants and Convertible or Exchangeable Securities
Based upon the reverse stock split ratio determined by the board of directors, proportionate adjustments are generally required to be made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities entitling the holders to purchase, exchange for, or convert into, shares of Common Stock.  This would result in approximately the same aggregate price being required to be paid under such options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities upon exercise, and approximately the same value of shares of Common Stock being delivered upon such exercise, exchange or conversion, immediately following the Reverse Stock Split as was the case immediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split.  The number of shares deliverable upon settlement or vesting of restricted stock awards will be similarly adjusted, subject to our treatment of fractional shares.  The number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to these securities will be proportionately based upon the reverse stock split ratio determined by the board of directors, subject to our treatment of fractional shares.
Accounting Matters
The proposed amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation will not affect the par value of our Common Stock per share, which will remain $0.001.  As a result, as of the Effective Time, the stated capital attributable to Common Stock and the additional paid-in capital account on our balance sheet will not change due to the Reverse Stock Split.  Reported per share net income or loss will be higher because there will be fewer shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split
The following summary describes certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split to holders of our Common Stock.
Unless otherwise specifically indicated herein, this summary addresses the tax consequences only to a beneficial owner of our Common Stock that is a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of our Common Stock (a "U.S. holder").  A trust may also be a U.S. holder if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.  An estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source may also be a U.S. holder.  This summary does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to any particular investor, including tax considerations that arise from rules of general application to all taxpayers or to certain classes of taxpayers or that are generally assumed to be known by investors.  This summary also does not address the tax consequences to (i) persons that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks, insurance companies, thrift institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, U.S.  expatriates, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, traders in securities that elect to mark to market and dealers in securities or currencies, (ii) persons that hold our Common Stock as part of a position in a "straddle" or as part of a "hedging," "conversion" or other integrated investment transaction for federal income tax purposes, or (iii) persons that do not hold our Common Stock as "capital assets" (generally, property held for investment).
If a partnership (or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.  Partnerships that hold our Common Stock, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split.
This summary is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial authority, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement.  Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split.
PLEASE CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION.
U.S. Holders
The Reverse Stock Split should be treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Therefore, a stockholder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the reverse stock split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share interest in the post-reverse stock split shares. The aggregate tax basis of the post-split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-split shares exchanged therefore (excluding any portion of the holder's basis allocated to fractional shares), and the holding period of the post-split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-split shares exchanged. A holder of the pre-split shares who receives cash will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the portion of the tax basis of the pre-split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will be short term if the pre-split shares were held for one year or less and long term if held more than one year. No gain or loss will be recognized by us as a result of the reverse stock split.
No Appraisal Rights
Under Delaware law and our charter documents, holders of our Common Stock will not be entitled to dissenter's rights or appraisal rights with respect to the Reverse Stock Split.
Vote Required to Approve the Amendment and Recommendation
Under Delaware law and our charter documents, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date is required to approve the Reverse Stock Split.
Our board of directors recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize the Reverse Stock Split.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our Common Stock owned beneficially based on 93,164,738 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date by: (i) each of our directors; (ii) each of our named executive officers; and (iii) each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock based upon Schedules 13G or 13D filed with the SEC.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Other than as described in the notes to the table, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to shares beneficially owned by them. All share ownership figures include shares issuable upon exercise of options or warrants exercisable within 60 days of the Record Date, which are deemed outstanding and beneficially owned by such person for purposes of computing his or her percentage ownership, but not for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

SPECIAL CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 This Proxy Statement contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements reflect the current view about future events. When used in this Proxy Statement the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "future," "intend," "plan" or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to us or our management identify forward looking statements. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this Proxy Statement relating to our business, business strategy, and potential implementation of a reverse stock split and the impact thereunder. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statement of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include, a continued decline in general economic conditions nationally and internationally, decreased demand for our products and services; market acceptance of our products; the ability to protect our intellectual property rights; impact of any litigation or infringement actions brought against us; competition from other providers and products; risks in product development; inability to raise capital to fund continuing operations; changes in government regulation, the ability to complete customer transactions and capital raising transactions, and other factors relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations and any businesses that may be acquired by us. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.
Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.

By Order of the Board of Directors,
Annex A
CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT 
TO
THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
OF 
DPW HOLDINGS, INC. 
DPW Holdings, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation") hereby certifies that the amendment set forth below to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") was duly adopted in accordance with sections 141 and 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") by the board of directors of the Corporation as of December 18, 2018, and approved by a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation as of February 28, 2019:
RESOLVED, that Article IV Section 2 of the Certificate is hereby amended to include the following:
(h)       Reverse Stock Split. As of the effective date of January 24, 2018 and upon the filing of this Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time"), each _______ (__) outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (the "Old Common Stock") shall be split and converted into one (1) share of Class A Common Stock (the "New Common Stock"). This reverse stock split (the "Reverse Split") of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock shall not affect the total number of shares of capital stock, including the Class A Common Stock, that the Company is authorized to issue, which shall remain as set forth under the heading "Authorized Shares" of this Article IV.
The Reverse Split shall occur without any further action on the part of the Corporation or the holders of shares of New Common Stock and whether or not certificates representing such holders' shares prior to the Reverse Split are surrendered for cancellation. No fractional interest in a share of New Common Stock shall be deliverable upon the Reverse Split. Holders who would otherwise hold fractional shares of New Common Stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) in lieu of such fractional shares, on the basis of prevailing market prices of the Common Stock at the time of sale. After the Reverse Split, a holder will have no further interest in the Corporation with respect to its fractional share interest, and persons otherwise entitled to a fractional share will not have any voting, dividend or other rights with respect thereto except the right to receive the aforementioned cash payment. All references to "Common Stock" in these Articles shall be to the New Common Stock.
The Reverse Split will be effectuated on a stockholder-by-stockholder (as opposed to certificate-by-certificate) basis. Certificates dated as of a date prior to the Effective Time representing outstanding shares of Old Common Stock shall, after the Effective Time, represent a number of shares equal to the same number of shares of New Common Stock as is reflected on the face of such certificates, divided by ________ (__) (subject to the treatment of fractional shares described above). The Corporation shall not be obligated to issue new certificates evidencing the shares of New Common Stock outstanding as a result of the Reverse Split unless and until the certificates evidencing the shares held by a holder prior to the Reverse Split are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.
RESOLVED, that the language under Article IV Section 1, 3 and 4 shall not be amended in any way;
RESOLVED, that the foregoing amendment has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 242(b)(1) of the DGCL by the vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Certificate of Amendment to be signed by its duly authorized officer as of ________ __, 2019.
