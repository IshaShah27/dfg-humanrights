BRANDYWINEGLOBAL — GLOBAL INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND INC. 
(NYSE: BWG) 
620 Eighth Avenue, 49th Floor, New York, New York 10018 
PROXY STATEMENT 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of BrandywineGLOBAL — Global Income Opportunities Fund Inc. (the "Fund") of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Fund to be held at 620 Eighth Avenue (at 41st Street), 49th Floor, New York, New York, on Friday, February 22, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., New York time, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Meeting"), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice"). 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials are being made available to stockholders on or about January 15, 2019. 
The Fund is organized as a Maryland corporation and is a registered investment company. 
Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC ("LMPFA"), whose principal business address is 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10018, is the Fund's investment adviser and administrator. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement with Brandywine Global Investment Management LLC ("Brandywine"), Brandywine serves as the Fund's sub-investment advisor. Brandywine is located at 1735 Market Street, 18th Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. LMPFA and Brandywine are all wholly-owned subsidiaries of Legg Mason, Inc. ("Legg Mason"). 
Even if you plan to attend the Meeting, please sign, date and return a proxy card, or provide voting instructions by telephone or over the Internet. If you vote by telephone or over the Internet, you will be asked to enter a unique code that has been assigned to you and which is printed on your proxy card. This code is designed to confirm your identity, provide access into the voting sites and confirm that your instructions are properly recorded. If you require additional information, please call toll free at 1-866-875-8614. 
All properly executed proxies received prior to the Meeting will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked thereon or otherwise as provided therein. Unless instructions to the contrary are marked, shares represented by the proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of each nominee in Proposal 1. Stockholders who execute proxies may revoke them at any time before they are voted by filing with the Fund a written notice of revocation, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. In accordance with the Fund's By-Laws, a quorum is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund's common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, abstentions will be treated as shares that are present but which have not been voted. 
The Board has fixed the close of business on December 21, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders of the Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Fund has two classes of shares: Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, and fixed-rate Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Preferred Shares"), which have a liquidation   preference of $100,000 per share (collectively with the Common Stock, the "Shares"). Stockholders of the Fund on that date will be entitled to one vote on each matter for each share held, and a fractional vote with respect to fractional shares, with no cumulative voting rights. At the Record Date, the Fund had outstanding 20,989,795 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 500 Preferred Shares. 
Annual reports are sent to stockholders of record of the Fund following the Fund's fiscal year end. The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its annual report and most recent semi-annual report succeeding the annual report, if any, to a stockholder upon request. Such requests should be directed to the Fund at 620 Eighth Avenue, 49th Floor, New York, New York 10018 or by calling toll free at 888-777-0102. Copies of annual and semi-annual reports of the Fund are also available on the Fund's website at lmcef.com or on the EDGAR Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Internet site at www.sec.gov. 
Please note that only one annual or semi-annual report or Proxy Statement may be delivered to two or more stockholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of an annual or semi-annual report or the Proxy Statement, or for instructions as to how to request a separate copy of these documents or as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies of these documents are received, stockholders should contact the Fund at the address and phone number set forth above. 
Vote Required and Manner of Voting Proxies 
A quorum of stockholders is required to take action at the Meeting. A majority of the shares of the Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum of stockholders at the Meeting. 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the Meeting. The inspector of election, who is an employee of the proxy solicitor engaged by the Fund, will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the Meeting. The inspector of election will treat abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees, typically in "street name," as to which proxies have been returned but (a) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (b) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
If you hold shares directly (not through a broker-dealer, bank or other financial intermediary) and if you return a signed proxy card that does not specify how you wish to vote on a proposal, your shares will be voted "FOR" Proposal 1. 
Broker-dealer firms holding shares of the Fund in "street name" for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares on each Proposal before the Meeting. A signed proxy card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of Fund shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner's shares should be voted on a proposal will be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of Proposal 1. 
If you hold shares of the Fund through a service agent that has entered into a service agreement with the Fund, the service agent may be the record holder of your shares. At the Meeting, a service agent will vote shares for which it receives instructions from its customers in accordance with those instructions. A signed proxy card or other authorization by a stockholder that does not specify how the stockholder's shares should be voted on a proposal may be deemed to authorize a service agent to vote such shares in favor of Proposal 1. Depending on its policies, applicable law or contractual or other restrictions, a service agent may be permitted   to vote shares with respect to which it has not received specific voting instructions from its customers. In those cases, the service agent may, but may not be required to, vote such shares in the same proportion as those shares for which the service agent has received voting instructions. This practice is commonly referred to as "echo voting." 
If you beneficially own shares that are held in "street name" through a broker-dealer or that are held of record by a service agent and if you do not give specific voting instructions for your shares, they may not be voted at all or, as described above, they may be voted in a manner that you may not intend. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to give your broker-dealer or service agent specific instructions as to how you want your shares to be voted. 
Required Vote 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of the Fund's Common Stock and  Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class, present in person or represented by proxy at a Meeting at which a quorum is present.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One Director is elected by plurality of the votes cast only by the holders of shares of the Fund's Preferred Shares  present in person or represented by proxy at a Meeting at which a quorum is present.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For purposes of the election of Directors, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast, and do not  affect the plurality vote required for the election of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
If the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve Proposal 1 is not obtained at the Meeting, the chairman of the Meeting or the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments or postponements of the Meeting in accordance with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. If in the judgment of the chairman of the Meeting, it is advisable to defer action on the Proposal, the chairman of the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting with respect to the Proposal for a reasonable period or periods. The Meeting may be adjourned up to 120 days after the original record date for the Meeting without further notice other than announcement at the Meeting. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Meeting to be Held on February 22, 2019 
The proxy statement and related materials are available at www.proxy-direct.com/30328 
Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors 
In accordance with the Fund's Charter, the Board is currently divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. Except as noted below, the Directors serving in Class I have terms expiring at the Meeting, and they have been nominated by the Board of Directors for election at the Meeting to serve for a term of three years (until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders), or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until they resign or are otherwise removed. One person has also been nominated by the Board of Directors for election at the meeting as a Class II Director for a term of one year (until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholder) or until her successor has been duly elected and qualified or until she resigns or is otherwise removed. The terms of office of the remaining Class II and Class III Directors expire at the year 2020 and 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, respectively, or thereafter until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until they resign or are otherwise removed. The effect of these staggered terms is to limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund by delaying the replacement of a majority of the Board of Directors.  Under the terms of the Fund's charter, the preferred stockholders are entitled as a class, to the exclusion of the common stockholders, to elect two Directors of the Fund (the "Preferred Share Directors"). Carol L. Colman and William R. Hutchinson have been designated as the Preferred Share Directors. The charter further provides that the remaining nominees shall be elected by holders of Common Stock and Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class. 
The persons named in the proxy intend to vote at the Meeting (unless directed not to vote) "FOR" the election of the nominees named below. Each of the nominees is currently a member of the Fund's Board of Directors and has indicated that he or she will serve if elected. However, if any nominee should be unable to serve, the proxy will be voted for any other person determined by the persons named in the proxy in their discretion. 
Certain information concerning the nominees for Directors of the Fund and other Directors of the Fund is set forth in the following table.

 Each of the Directors has served as a director of the Fund as indicated in the table above.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors is responsible under applicable state law for overseeing generally the management and operations of the Fund. The Directors oversee the Fund's operations by, among other things, meeting at its regularly scheduled meetings and as otherwise needed with the Fund's management and evaluating the performance of the Fund's service providers including LMPFA, Brandywine, the custodian and the transfer   agent. As part of this process, the Directors consult with the Fund's independent auditors and with their own separate independent counsel. 
The Directors review the Fund's financial statements, performance, net asset value and market price and the relationship between them, as well as the quality of the services being provided to the Fund. As part of this process, the Directors review the Fund's fees and expenses in light of the nature, quality and scope of the services being received while also seeking to ensure that the Fund continues to have access to high quality services in the future. 
The Board of Directors has four regularly scheduled meetings each year, and additional meetings may be scheduled as needed. In addition, the Board has a standing Audit Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Nominating Committee"), Compensation Committee and Pricing and Valuation Committee that meet periodically and whose responsibilities are described below. 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held four regular meetings and one special meeting. Each Director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees for which he or she was eligible. The Fund does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by Directors at annual meetings of stockholders. 
Each of the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, Compensation Committee and Pricing and Valuation Committee is composed of all Directors who have been determined not to be "interested persons" of the Fund, LMPFA, Brandywine within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and who are "independent" as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards ("Independent Directors"), and is chaired by an Independent Director. The Board in its discretion from time to time may establish ad hoc committees. 
The Board of Directors is currently comprised of eight directors, seven of whom are Independent Directors. Jane E. Trust serves as Chairman of the Board. Ms. Trust is an "interested person" of the Fund. The appointment of Ms. Trust as Chairman reflects the Board's belief that her experience, familiarity with the Fund's day-to-day operations and access to individuals with responsibility for the Fund's management and operations provides the Board with insight into the Fund's business and activities and, with her access to appropriate administrative support, facilitates the efficient development of meeting agendas that address the Fund's business, legal and other needs and the orderly conduct of board meetings. Mr. Hutchinson serves as Lead Independent Director. The Chairman develops agendas for Board meetings in consultation with the Lead Independent Director and presides at all meetings of the Board. The Lead Independent Director, among other things, chairs executive sessions of the Independent Directors, serves as a spokesperson for the Independent Directors and serves as a liaison between the Independent Directors and the Fund's management between Board meetings. The Independent Directors regularly meet outside the presence of management and are advised by independent legal counsel. The Board also has determined that its leadership structure, as described above, is appropriate in light of the size and complexity of the Fund, the number of Independent Directors (who constitute a super-majority of the Board's membership) and the Board's general oversight responsibility. The Board also believes that its leadership structure not only facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Directors from management, including Brandywine, the Fund's subadviser, but also enhances the independent and orderly exercise of its responsibilities.  Audit Committee 
The Fund's Audit Committee is composed entirely of all of the Independent Directors: Mses. Colman, Kamerick and Kumar and Messrs. Agdern, Cronin, Cucchi and Hutchinson. Ms. Kamerick serves as the Chair of the Audit Committee and has been determined by the Board to be an "audit committee financial expert." The principal functions of the Audit Committee are: to (a) oversee the scope of the Fund's audit, the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices and its internal controls and enhance the quality and objectivity of the audit function; (b) approve, and recommend to the Independent Board Members (as such term is defined in the Audit Committee Charter) for their ratification, the selection, appointment, retention or termination of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, as well as approving the compensation thereof; and (c) approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund and certain other persons by the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. This Committee met twice during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Fund's website at www.lmcef.com and click on the name of the Fund. 
Nominating Committee 
The Fund's Nominating Committee, the principal function of which is to select and nominate candidates for election as Directors of the Fund, is composed of all of the Independent Directors: Mses. Colman, Kamerick and Kumar and Messrs. Agdern, Cronin, Cucchi and Hutchinson. Mr. Cronin serves as the Chair of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee may consider nominees recommended by the stockholder as it deems appropriate. Stockholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send recommendations to the Fund's Secretary that include all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of Directors. A recommendation must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board of Directors and to serve if elected by the stockholders. The Nominating Committee met once during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Fund's website at www.lmcef.com and click on the name of the Fund. 
The Nominating Committee identifies potential nominees through its network of contacts, and in its discretion may also engage a professional search firm. The Nominating Committee meets to discuss and consider such candidates' qualifications and then chooses a candidate by majority vote. The Nominating Committee does not have specific, minimum qualifications for nominees and has not established specific qualities or skills that it regards as necessary for one or more of the Fund's Directors to possess (other than any qualities or skills that may be required by applicable law, regulation or listing standard). However, as set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter, in evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as a Director of the Fund, the Nominee Committee may consider the following factors, among any others it may deem relevant: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the person is an "interested person" as defined in the 1940 Act and whether the person is  otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a Director of the Fund;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the person has any relationships that might impair his or her independence, such as any business, financial  or family relationships with Fund management, the investment manager of the Fund, Fund service providers or their affiliates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the person serves on boards of, or is otherwise affiliated with, competing financial service organizations  or their related mutual fund complexes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for the performance of the  duties of a Director of the Fund;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the contribution which the person can make to the Board and the Fund (or, if the person has previously served as a Director  of the Fund, the contribution which the person made to the Board during his or her previous term of service), with consideration being given to the person's business and professional experience, education and such other factors as the Committee  may consider relevant;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the character and integrity of the person; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the selection and nomination of the person would be consistent with the requirements of the Fund's  retirement policies.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee does not have a formal diversity policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying potential director nominees but may consider diversity of professional experience, education and skills when evaluating potential nominees for Board membership. 
Pricing and Valuation Committee 
The Fund's Pricing and Valuation Committee is composed of all of the Independent Directors. The members of the Pricing and Valuation Committee are Mses. Colman, Kamerick and Kumar and Messrs. Agdern, Cronin, Cucchi and Hutchinson. Ms. Colman serves as Chair of the Fund's Pricing and Valuation Committee. The principal function of the Pricing and Valuation Committee is to assist the Board with its oversight of the process for valuing portfolio securities in light of applicable law, regulatory guidance and applicable policies and procedures adopted by the Fund. The Pricing and Valuation Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. 
Compensation Committee 
The Fund's Compensation Committee is composed of all of the Independent Directors. The members of the Compensation Committee are Mses. Colman, Kamerick and Kumar and Messrs. Agdern, Cronin, Cucchi, and Hutchinson. Mr. Cucchi serves as Chair of the Fund's Compensation Committee. The principal function of the Compensation Committee is to recommend the appropriate compensation of the Independent Directors for their service on the Board and the committees of the Board. The Compensation Committee met once during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Fund's website at www.lmcef.com and click on the name of the Fund. 
Risk Oversight 
The Board's role in risk oversight of the Fund reflects its responsibility under applicable state law to oversee generally, rather than to manage, the operations of the Fund. In line with this oversight responsibility, the Board receives reports and makes inquiry at its regular meetings and as needed regarding the nature and extent of significant Fund risks (including investment, compliance and valuation risks) that potentially could have a materially adverse impact on the business operations, investment performance or reputation of the   Fund, but relies upon the Fund's management (including the Fund's portfolio managers) and Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Board, and the Manager to assist it in identifying and understanding the nature and extent of such risks and determining whether, and to what extent, such risks may be eliminated or mitigated. In addition to reports and other information received from Fund management and the Manager regarding the Fund's investment program and activities, the Board as part of its risk oversight efforts meets at its regular meetings and as needed with the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer to discuss, among other things, risk issues and issues regarding the policies, procedures and controls of the Fund. The Board may be assisted in performing aspects of its role in risk oversight by the Audit Committee and such other standing or special committees as may be established from time to time by the Board. For example, the Audit Committee of the Board regularly meets with the Fund's independent public accounting firm to review, among other things, reports on the Fund's internal controls for financial reporting. 
The Board believes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Directors as to risk management matters are typically summaries of relevant information and may be inaccurate or incomplete. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board's risk management oversight is subject to substantial limitations. 
Officers 
The Fund's executive officers are chosen each year at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the Fund, to hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Officers of the Fund receive no compensation from the Fund although they may be reimbursed by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket travel expenses for attending Board meetings. In addition to Ms. Trust, the Fund's Chairman, CEO and President, the executive officers of the Fund currently are:

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act in combination require the Fund's Directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Fund's common stock, as well as LMPFA and certain of its affiliated persons, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"). Such persons and entities are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Fund with copies of all such filings. Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons, the Fund believes that, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, all such filing requirements were met with respect to the Fund. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
Pursuant to a meeting of the Audit Committee on December 18, 2018, the Audit Committee reports that it has: (i) reviewed and discussed the Fund's audited financial statements with management; (ii) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards ("SAS") No. 114, which supersedes SAS No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and (iii) previously received written confirmation from PwC that it is independent and written disclosures regarding such independence as required by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and discussed with PwC the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Fund's Board, the Audit Committee is responsible for conferring with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing annual financial statements and recommending the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing and financial matters affecting the Fund. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out the proper audits and reviews of the Fund's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are responsible for oversight. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principals and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Based on the review and discussions referred to in items (i) through (iii) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Fund's annual report for the Fund's fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

December 18, 2018  Board Recommendation and Required Vote 
Ms. Kumar and Messrs. Cronin and Cucchi are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of the Fund's Common Stock and Preferred Shares voting together as a single class present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present, and Ms. Colman is elected only by the holders of shares of the Fund's Preferred Shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present. For purposes of the election of Directors, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast, and do not affect the plurality vote required for Directors. 
The Board of Directors, including the Directors who are not "interested" persons unanimously recommends that stockholders of the Fund vote FOR each of the nominees for Director. 
Disclosure of Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 for professional services rendered by PwC for the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements, or services that are normally provided in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements in those fiscal years, were $61,000 and $54,290, respectively. 
Audit-Related Fees. The aggregate fees billed by PwC in connection with assurance and related services related to the annual audit of the Fund and for review of the Fund's financial statements, other than the Audit Fees described above, for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 were $0 and $6,427, respectively. 
In addition, there were no Audit Related Fees billed in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 for assurance and related services by PwC to LMPFA and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with LMPFA that provides ongoing services to the Fund (LMPFA and such other entities together, the "Service Affiliates"), that were related to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. 
Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed by PwC for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning services, which include the filing and amendment of federal, state and local income tax returns, timely regulated investment company qualification review and tax distribution and analysis planning to the Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 were $4,000 and $0, respectively. 
There were no fees billed by PwC to the Service Affiliates for tax services for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 that were required to be approved by the Fund's Audit Committee. 
All Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed for other non-audit services rendered by PwC to the Fund for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 were $0 and $0, respectively. 
There were no other non-audit services rendered by PwC to the Service Affiliates in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018. 
Generally, the Audit Committee must approve (a) all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Fund and (b) all permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Service Affiliates that relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may implement policies and procedures by which such services are approved other than by the full Committee but has not yet done so. 
The Audit Committee approved 100% of the Audit Related Fees, Tax Fees and Other Fees, if any, for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018.  The Audit Committee shall not approve non-audit services that the Committee believes may impair the independence of the registered public accounting firm. As of the date of the approval of the Audit Committee Charter, permissible non-audit services include any professional services (including tax services), that are not prohibited services as described below, provided to the Fund by the independent registered public accounting firm, other than those provided to the Fund in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of the Fund. Permissible non-audit services may not include: (i) bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Fund; (ii) financial information systems design and implementation; (iii) appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; (iv) actuarial services; (v) internal audit outsourcing services; (vi) management functions or human resources; (vii) broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services; (viii) legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and (ix) any other service the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board determines, by regulation, is impermissible. 
Pre-approval by the Audit Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Manager and any Covered Service Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid to the independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided to (a) the Fund, (b) LMPFA and (c) any entity partially controlled by or under common control with LMPFA that provides ongoing services to the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that would not have to be approved by the Committee; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee (or its delegate(s)) prior to the completion of the audit. 
The aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for non-audit services rendered to the Fund and Service Affiliates for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 were $0 and $678,000, respectively. 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services to the Service Affiliates that were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee (because they did not require pre-approval) is compatible with maintaining PwC's independence. All services provided by PwC to the Fund or to the Service Affiliates that were required to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee were pre-approved. 
A representative of PwC, if requested by any stockholder, will be present via telephone at the Meeting to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she chooses to do so.  5% Beneficial Ownership 
At December 21, 2018, to the knowledge of management, the registered stockholders who owned of record or owned beneficially more than 5% of the Fund's capital stock outstanding is noted below.
