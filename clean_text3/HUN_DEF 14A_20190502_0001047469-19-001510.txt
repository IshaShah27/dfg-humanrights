Huntsman, Douglas and Stryker in recognition of each officer's significant contributions to us in 2017 in connection with the separation of our Pigments and Additives business and transactions with respect to the related initial public offering of Venator.   (2)This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of awards of restricted stock or phantom stock, as applicable, and performance share units for each NEO computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, disregarding the estimate of forfeitures. For purposes of restricted stock and phantom stock awards, fair value is calculated using the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. For purposes of performance share unit awards, fair value is calculated based on the probability of attaining the target performance goals on the date of grant. For information on the valuation assumptions with regard to stock awards, refer to the notes to our financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the applicable year ended 2018, 2017 or 2016, respectively, as filed with the SEC. These amounts reflect the fair value of the reported awards on the date of grant and may not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the NEOs.   (3)This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options for each NEO computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, disregarding the estimate of forfeitures.

See "—Pension Benefits in 2018" for additional information, including the present value assumptions used in this calculation. None of the NEOs had above-market or preferential earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation during 2018. See "—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018" for additional information.   (6)The methodology used to compute the aggregate incremental cost of perquisites and other personal benefits for each individual NEO is based on the total cost to our company, and such costs are required to be reported under SEC rules when the total cost are equal to or greater than $10,000 in the aggregate for a NEO. The table 
(a)The cost to us for personal use of our aircraft is calculated according to a time-sharing agreement whereby incremental total direct costs including fuel, maintenance, repairs, insurance, etc. are assigned to us by number of flight hours used. We followed a quarterly cost calculation method to account for the 66.3 personal flight hours used by Mr. Huntsman during 2018. Contributions to the Supplemental Savings Plan on Mr. Huntsman's behalf are included in our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table below.

(1)These columns show annual cash performance awards granted under our annual cash performance award program to the NEOs in 2018. See the chart and accompanying narrative disclosure in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—2018 Annual Cash Performance Award" for additional information with respect to these amounts. The amounts reported in the table represent the target and maximum cash performance award guidelines established by the Compensation Committee but do not reflect the maximum annual dollar denominated incentive award amount that could be paid under the annual pool program, which amount is not determinable at the time the awards are granted and may not exceed the $15 million limit under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. The amounts actually earned by each of the NEOs pursuant to our annual cash performance award program for 2018 are reported in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.   (2)These columns show performance share units granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to the NEOs in 2018. The performance share units vest on December 31, 2018, subject to the achievement of relative TSR performance metrics. Amounts reported in the (a) "Threshold" column reflect the threshold number of performance share units (i.e., 25% of target) that may be earned for a certain minimum level of performance, (b) "Target" column reflects the target number of performance share units, or 100%, that may be earned and (c) "Maximum" column reflect the maximum number of performance share units that may be earned (i.e., 200% of target), in each case, based on relative TSR achievement against applicable performance metrics. If performance is below the threshold, no performance share units are earned. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—Long-Term Equity Compensation" for additional information with respect to these awards.   (3)This column shows the number of restricted shares or phantom shares, as applicable, granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to the NEOs in 2018. The restricted shares and phantom shares each vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. During the restriction period, each restricted share entitles the individual to vote such share, and each restricted share entitles the individual to accrue quarterly payments by us equal to the quarterly dividend on one share of our common stock. During the restriction period, each phantom share does not entitle the individual to vote such share, however each phantom share entitles the individual to accrue quarterly payments by us equal to the quarterly dividend on one share of our common stock.   (4)This column shows the number of nonqualified options granted under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to the NEOs in 2018. The option awards become exercisable and vest ratably in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.   (5)The exercise price of the nonqualified options disclosed in this column is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.   (6)This column shows the full grant date fair value of the awards computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. With respect to the performance share units, the amount shown reflects the full grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based on probable achievement of the market conditions, which is consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation to be recognized over the service period, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. 
(1)Option awards vest and become exercisable ratably in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of each respective grant date. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding option awards granted on February 23, 2010, February 2, 2011, February 1, 2012, February 6, 2013, February 5, 2014, February 4, 2015 and November 4, 2015 are 100% vested. No option awards were granted in 2008. The outstanding option awards granted on February 3, 2016 were vested as to 662/3% on February 3, 2018, and will vest as to 100% on February 3, 2019. The outstanding option awards granted on February 1, 2017 vested as to 331/3% on February 1, 2018, and will vest as to 662/3% on February 1, 2019 and as to 100% on February 1, 2020. The option awards granted February 7, 2018 will vest as to 331/3% on February 7, 2019, and will vest as to 662/3% on February 7, 2020 and as to 100% on February 7, 2021.   (2)Restricted stock awards vest and lapse their associated restrictions ratably in three equal annual installments on the first three anniversaries of each respective grant date. Restricted stock awards have generally been granted on the same day as option awards and vest on the same schedule as footnoted for option awards above. As of December 31, 2018, the restricted stock awards granted on February 3, 2016 vested as to 662/3% on February 3, 2018, and will vest as to 100% on February 3, 2019. The outstanding restricted stock awards granted on February 1, 2017 vested as to 331/3% on February 1, 2018, and will vest as to 662/3% on February 1, 2019 and as to 100% on February 1, 2020. The outstanding restricted stock awards granted on February 7, 2018 will vest as to 331/3% on February 7, 2019, and will vest as to 662/3% on February 7, 2020 and as to 100% on February 7, 2021. In lieu of restricted stock, Mr. Aggarwal was awarded phantom shares.   (3)The market value of unvested restricted stock is calculated by multiplying $19.29, the closing market price of our stock on December 31, 2018, by the number of unvested restricted shares as of December 31, 2018 for each restricted stock grant listed above. 
(4)The performance share units granted on February 3, 2016 have a performance period of three years ended on December 31, 2018, subject to the achievement of relative TSR performance metrics. Amounts in this table with respect to the 2016 grant reflect an estimated payout of a number of shares based on the maximum level of achievement with respect to the applicable performance metrics, as performance through December 31, 2018 exceeded the target performance level. The shares were not deemed fully vested until certification occurred in February 2019. The performance share units granted on February 1, 2017 have a performance period of three years ending on December 31, 2019, also subject to the achievement of relative TSR performance metrics. Amounts in this table with respect to the 2017 grant reflect an estimated payout of a number of shares based on the maximum level of achievement with respect to the applicable performance metrics, as performance through December 31, 2018 exceeded the target performance level. The performance share units granted on February 7, 2018 have a performance period of three years ending on December 31, 2020, also subject to the achievement of relative TSR performance metrics. Amounts in this table with respect to the 2018 grant reflect an estimated payout of the target number of shares.   (5)The market value of unvested performance share units reported in this column is calculated by multiplying $19.29, the closing market price of our stock on December 31, 2018 (the last trading day of fiscal 2018), by the number of unvested performance share units as of December 31, 2018 based on the level of achievement with respect to the applicable performance metrics. 
(1)The following tabular disclosure provides information regarding the value realized on option exercises. 
(a)Messrs. Huntsman, Hankins and Stryker did not sell any shares received from the respective option exercises, and each NEO continued to be at risk for subsequent changes in the value of these shares. 
(1)Messrs. Douglas and Aggarwal do not participate in any of our pension plans.   (2)The number of years of service credited to the NEO is determined using the same pension plan measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes. These assumptions are discussed in "Note 17. Employee Benefit Plans" to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K.   (3)The actuarial present value of the accumulated benefits is determined using the same pension plan measurement date and assumptions as used for financial reporting purposes. These assumptions are discussed in "Note 18. Employee Benefit Plans" to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. For purposes of performing these calculations, a normal retirement (earliest unreduced) age of 65 was utilized for Messrs. Huntsman and Stryker, and a normal retirement (earliest unreduced) age of 62 was used for Mr. Hankins. All accrued benefits are assumed payable at the plan's earliest unreduced retirement age. Benefit values reported in this table have been projected out to assume payment at the normal retirement age then have been discounted back to a present value as of December 31, 2018.   (4)As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Hankins had served 39.4 years with our company. The Huntsman Pension Scheme (U.K.) was frozen to new participants and years of credited service ceased to accrue as of February 29, 2012. Benefits for Mr. Hankins under this plan will only increase based on changes in salary.   (5)We credited Mr. Stryker with 10 years of service under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan when he was hired in June 2013. 
(1)These contributions represent deferrals under the Supplemental Savings Plan and are included in the Salary column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 set forth above.   (2)These amounts represent contributions to our Supplemental Savings Plan and are included in the "All other compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 set forth above.   (3)No above market or preferential earnings are provided under our nonqualified defined contribution plans because the investment choices available under such plans are virtually identical to the investment choices available in the 401(k) Plan, which is a qualified plan. Consequently, none of the earnings reported in this table are included in the Summary Compensation Table set forth above.   (4)Amounts reflected in this column for each NEO who participates in the plans were previously reported as compensation to the executive officer in the Summary Compensation Table as follows: Mr. Huntsman—$2,256,629, Mr. Hankins—$716,233, and Mr. Stryker—$12,600. We ceased contributions to the SEMPP as of August 31, 2014.   (5)This amount includes a contribution of $7,500 contribution match and $419,146 which represents a 6% nondiscretionary contribution to the Supplemental Savings Plan.   (6)This amount includes $1,316,880 from our Supplemental Savings Plan and $6,687,714 from the SEMPP. 
(7)This amount includes a contribution of $40,683 contribution match and $61,024 which represents a 6% nondiscretionary contribution to the Supplemental Savings Plan.   (8)This amount includes $520,670 from our Supplemental Savings Plan.   (9)This amount includes a contribution of $70,368 contribution match and $105,552 which represents a 6% nondiscretionary contribution to the Supplemental Savings Plan.   (10)This amount includes $2,644,640 from our Supplemental Savings Plan and $664,067 from the SEMPP.   (11)This amount includes a contribution of $7,500 contribution match to the Supplemental Savings Plan.   (12)This amount comprises $42,240 from our Supplemental Savings Plan.   (13)For reporting purposes, the 2018 values for Mr. Aggarwal have been converted using an exchange rate of 1 SGD to 0.7592 USD being the exchange rate as of February 26, 2018 (which is the internal date used to estimate pro forma elements of compensation).   (14)This amount comprises contribution match of $75,193 from our Huntsman International Retirement Benefit Plan.   (15)This amount comprises $400,816 from our Huntsman International Retirement Benefit Plan. 
(1)not available to participants in the 401(k) plan. 
(1)In the case of an involuntary termination without Reasonable Cause or for Good Reason, calculated by multiplying 150% of the employer and employee monthly premiums payable with respect to the health care coverage elected by the executive as of December 31, 2018, by 24. We assumed a monthly premium 50% larger than current premiums to reflect annual increases in premium costs in order to ensure that the amounts reported above include the total amount for which we are potentially responsible with respect to such coverage.   (2)We contract with a third-party provider for 12 months of outplacement services. To the extent these services might be utilized, we expect our cost would be as set forth herein.   (3)Any acceleration of vesting of long-term equity incentive awards held by Mr. Huntsman requires the approval of the Compensation Committee, which we assume for purposes of this table would have occurred on December 31, 2018. An acceleration of Mr. Huntsman's 283,627 unvested shares of restricted stock would have an estimated value of $5,471,165 and 406,784 target unvested performance share units would have an estimated value of $7,846,863. In addition, an acceleration of Mr. Huntsman's 533,501 unvested options would have an estimated value of $2,518,803 on December 31, 2018.   (4)Any acceleration of vesting of long-term equity incentive awards held by Mr. Douglas requires the approval of the Compensation Committee, which we assume for purposes of this table would have occurred on December 31, 2018. An acceleration of Mr. Douglas's 27,763 unvested shares of restricted stock would have an estimated value of $535,548 and 20,834 target unvested performance share units would have an estimated value of $401,888. In addition, an acceleration of Mr. Douglas's 53,121 unvested options would have an estimated value of $169,091 on December 31, 2018.   (5)Any acceleration of vesting of long-term equity incentive awards held by Mr. Hankins requires the approval of the Compensation Committee, which we assume for purposes of this table would have occurred on December 31, 2018. An acceleration of Mr. Hankins' 34,163 unvested shares of restricted stock would have an estimated value of $659,004 and 45,708 target unvested performance share units would have an estimated value of $881,707. In addition, an acceleration of Mr. Hankins' 62,774 unvested options would have an estimated value of $248,328 on December 31, 2018.   (6)Any acceleration of vesting of long-term equity incentive awards held by Mr. Stryker requires the approval of the Compensation Committee, which we assume for purposes of this table would have occurred on December 31, 2018. An acceleration of Mr. Stryker's 35,409 unvested shares of restricted stock would have an estimated value of $683,040 and 49,227 target unvested performance share units would have an estimated value of $949,589. In addition, an acceleration of Mr. Stryker's 65,945 unvested options would have an estimated value of $292,676 on December 31, 2018.   (7)Any acceleration of vesting of long term equity incentive awards held by Mr. Aggarwal requires the approval of the Compensation Committee, which we assume for purposes of this table would have occurred on December 31, 2018. An acceleration of Mr. Aggarwal's 18,165 unvested shares of phantom stock would have an estimated value of $350,403 and 11,716 target unvested performance share units would have an estimated value of $226,002. In addition, an acceleration of Mr. Aggarwal's 36,049 unvested options would have an estimated value of $102,862 on December 31, 2018.  (8)In the event of an involuntary termination following a change of control, this amount is equal to 2.9 times Mr. Huntsman's annual base salary. 
(1)Includes 4,544,951 outstanding options and 2,266,087 undelivered full value awards (including 1,403,130 outstanding performance share units at the maximum level, 504,348 unvested phantom shares, and 358,609 vested stock units.
