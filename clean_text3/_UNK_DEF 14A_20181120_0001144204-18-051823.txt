JOINT SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
To be held on November 20, 2018 
PROXY STATEMENT
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund and Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund (the "Funds"), each a series of Virtus Opportunities Trust (the "Trust"). The proxies will be used at the joint special meeting of shareholders to be held at the offices of Virtus Investment Partners, Inc., 100 Pearl Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06103 on November 20, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time (the "Meeting") and any adjournment(s) thereof. The Meeting will be held for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Joint Special Meeting of Shareholders. This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Joint Special Meeting and the proxy card are first being mailed to shareholders on or about October 8, 2018 or as soon as practicable thereafter. The close of business on September 21, 2018 has been fixed as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Meeting. Each Shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value (determined as of the applicable record date) of each Share owned by such Shareholder (number of Shares owned times net asset value per Share) on any matter on which such Shareholder is entitled to vote and each fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. 
As of the Record Date, each Fund had the following number of shares of common stock outstanding: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Fund   ​ ​  Number of Shares Outstanding   ​ 
 Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund  ​ ​ ​ ​ 2,779,682.686 ​ ​ 
 Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund   ​ ​ ​ ​ 52,762,255.299 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
A copy of each Fund's most recent annual and/or semi-annual report is available free of charge via the Internet at www.Virtus.com, by calling 800-243-1574, or by writing Virtus Mutual Funds, P.O. Box 9874, Providence, RI 02940-8074. A copy of this Proxy Statement is also available via the Internet at the Internet address provided on the proxy card.  ​
At the Meeting, shareholders of each Fund will be asked to vote to approve a change to the Fund's status from diversified to non-diversified. 
It is expected that the solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail, telephone, facsimile, Internet or personal contact by representatives of the Trust. Broadridge has been engaged to assist in the distribution and tabulation of proxies and to assist in the solicitation of proxies. The anticipated cost of such solicitation services is approximately $90,000. The costs associated with this Proxy Statement will be paid by the Funds, with the costs shared pro rata based on assets under management. 
The Trust may also request broker-dealer firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the shares of the Funds held of record by such persons. The Funds' investment adviser may reimburse such broker-dealer firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such proxy solicitation, including reasonable expenses in communicating with persons for whom they hold shares of the Funds. 
Voting Proxies.   You should read the entire Proxy Statement before voting. If you have any questions regarding the Proxy Statement, please call 800-243-1574. Representatives are available Monday through Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern time and Friday until 5:00 p.m. If you sign and return the accompanying proxy card, you may revoke it by giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Trust prior to the Meeting or by delivering a subsequently dated proxy card or by attending and voting at the Meeting in person. Proxies voted by telephone or Internet also may be revoked at any time before the meeting by proxy voting again through the website or toll-free number listed in the enclosed proxy card. Properly executed proxies will be voted, as you instruct, by the persons named in the accompanying Proxy Card. In the absence of such direction, however, the persons named in the accompanying Proxy Card intend to vote "FOR" the relevant Proposal(s) and may vote at their discretion with respect to other matters not now known to the Board that may be presented at the Meeting. Attendance by a shareholder at the Meeting does not, in itself, revoke a proxy. 
Quorum Required.   Each Fund must have a quorum of shares represented at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, to take action on any matter relating to the Fund. Under the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust"), a quorum is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of 331∕3% of the voting power of outstanding shares of a Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting. 
"Broker non-votes" are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by the Trust, but such proxy is not voted as to one  ​
or more proposals because instructions have not been received from beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary power. For each proposal contained in this Proxy Statement, abstentions and "broker non-votes" are treated as shares that are present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but do not represent votes cast with respect to a proposal and have the same effect as a "no" or "against" vote. 
If the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve the proposals is not obtained at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting, in accordance with applicable law, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment would require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voting on the adjournment. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that are entitled to vote in favor of the proposals, and all properly executed but unmarked proxies in favor of such adjournment, and will vote against any such adjournment those proxies that they have been instructed to vote against the proposals. Proxies received with an instruction to abstain from voting will abstain from voting on any adjourned proposal. A vote may be taken on a proposal in this proxy statement prior to any such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received for approval. 
BOARD OF TRUSTEES RECOMMENDATION
The Board met on September 20, 2018 to discuss the Proposals and voted unanimously to approve the Proposals. The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the relevant Proposal(s). ​
PROPOSAL 1 AND 2: TO APPROVE A CHANGE TO EACH FUND'S STATUS FROM DIVERSIFIED TO NON-DIVERSIFIED
Introduction: 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") requires every mutual fund to state as a fundamental policy whether it is a "diversified" fund or "non-diversified" fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act also requires shareholders to approve a change in a fund's fundamental policy and classification from a diversified fund to a non-diversified fund. 
Currently, each Fund is subject to the Trust's fundamental investment limitation as a diversified fund. A diversified fund is limited as to the amount it may invest in any single issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a diversified fund may not, with respect to 75% of its total assets, invest in securities of any issuer if, as a result of such investment (i) more than 5% of the value of the fund's total assets would be invested in securities of any one issuer, or (ii) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer. These percentage limitations do not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or to securities issued by other investment companies. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, a diversified fund may invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of one issuer. These limits apply at the time a diversified fund purchases a security; a diversified fund may exceed these limits if positions it already holds increase in value relative to the rest of the fund's holdings. In contrast, a non-diversified fund is not subject to the limits of a diversified fund; it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a single issuer or a fewer number of issuers than a diversified fund. 
Proposal 1: To approve a change to Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund's status from diversified to non-diversified 
Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund currently is classified as a diversified fund. Shareholders are being asked to approve a change in the Fund's classification from a diversified fund to a non-diversified fund, as defined under the 1940 Act, so that the Trust's fundamental diversification policy no longer applies. Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. ("VIA" or the "Adviser"), the Fund's investment adviser, and Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC ("KAR" or the "Subadviser"), the Fund's subadviser, believe that changing the Fund's classification to non-diversified will benefit the Fund's investment team by giving it the ability to invest a greater percentage of the Fund's assets in fewer issuers or any one issuer. The change would enable the Subadviser to focus the Fund's investments on  ​
those securities that the Subadviser believes are the most promising. Because the Subadviser would be able to invest larger percentages of the Fund's assets in the securities of fewer issuers, the Subadviser would be able to direct the Fund to take more meaningful positions in securities that are its top investment choices. In addition, the Subadviser believes that the proposed change would provide the Fund with increased flexibility to respond to future investment opportunities. 
Investing a larger percentage of the Fund's assets in any one issuer could increase the Fund's risk of loss and its share price volatility, because the value of its shares would be more susceptible to adverse events affecting that issuer. If the Subadviser directs the Fund to take a larger position in an issuer that subsequently has an adverse return, the Fund may have a greater loss than it would have had if the Subadviser had diversified the Fund's investments. The Subadviser would use this increased investment flexibility to take larger positions in the securities of fewer issuers only if and when it believes that doing so justifies the risks involved. 
The Subadviser does not expect the proposed change in the classification of the Fund to materially affect the manner in which the Fund's investment program is conducted at this time, as reflected in the Fund's current prospectus and statement of additional information. Other than the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified, the Adviser, Subadviser and the Board do not propose or anticipate any material change in the management of the Fund if the Proposal is approved. Any future material changes to the management of the Fund will require consideration by the Board and disclosure in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, as appropriate. 
In addition, the Fund is (and will remain) subject to the diversification rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code"). These rules provide that, to maintain favorable tax treatment, the Fund must invest at least 50% of its total assets so that no more than 5% of its total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer, and so that it holds no more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any issuer. With respect to the remaining 50% of its total assets, the Fund is limited to investing 25% in the securities of a single issuer. These limits apply only as of the end of each quarter of the Fund's fiscal year, so the Fund may actually have a higher concentration in an issuer during periods between the ends of its fiscal quarters. However, the Subadviser has no current intention of investing in the securities of any single issuer beyond the Tax Code limits. Like the 1940 Act limits, the Tax Code limits do not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or to securities issued by other investment companies.  ​
If shareholders of the Fund approve Proposal 1, the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified will become effective when the Fund's registration statement is revised or supplemented to reflect that the fundamental investment limitation requiring diversification no longer applies to the Fund. If shareholders of the Fund do not approve Proposal 1, the Fund will continue to be subject to the fundamental policy requiring diversification and will continue to operate as a "diversified" fund. 
Required Vote: 
Proposal 1 will be voted on by shareholders of Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund only, with the Fund's share classes voting together. To approve Proposal 1, the Fund must receive an affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund," which is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (A) 67% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (B) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (a "1940 Act Majority Vote"). Approval of Proposal 1 by shareholders of the Fund is not contingent upon approval of Proposal 2 by shareholders of Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund. If the Fund approves Proposal 1 and the other Fund does not approve Proposal 2, the Fund will change its classification to "non-diversified," while the other Fund will remain diversified. 
Proposal 2: To approve a change to Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund's status from diversified to non-diversified 
Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund currently is classified as a diversified fund. Shareholders are being asked to approve a change in the Fund's classification from a diversified fund to a non-diversified fund, as defined under the 1940 Act, so that the Trust's fundamental diversification policy no longer applies. VIA, the Fund's investment adviser, and KAR, the Fund's subadviser, believe that changing the Fund's classification to non-diversified will benefit the Fund's investment team by giving it the ability to invest a greater percentage of the Fund's assets in fewer issuers or any one issuer. The change would enable the Subadviser to focus the Fund's investments on those securities that the Subadviser believes are the most promising. Because the Subadviser would be able to invest larger percentages of the Fund's assets in the securities of fewer issuers, the Subadviser would be able to direct the Fund to take more meaningful positions in securities that are its top investment choices. In addition, the Subadviser believes that the proposed change would provide the Fund with increased flexibility to respond to future investment opportunities. 
Investing a larger percentage of the Fund's assets in any one issuer could increase the Fund's risk of loss and its share price volatility, because  ​
the value of its shares would be more susceptible to adverse events affecting that issuer. If the Subadviser directs the Fund to take a larger position in an issuer that subsequently has an adverse return, the Fund may have a greater loss than it would have had if the Subadviser had diversified the Fund's investments. The Subadviser would use this increased investment flexibility to take larger positions in the securities of fewer issuers only if and when it believes that doing so justifies the risks involved. 
The Subadviser does not expect the proposed change in the classification of the Fund to materially affect the manner in which the Fund's investment program is conducted at this time, as reflected in the Fund's current prospectus and statement of additional information. Other than the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified, the Adviser, Subadviser and the Board do not propose or anticipate any material change in the management of the Fund if the Proposal is approved. Any future material changes to the management of the Fund will require consideration by the Board and disclosure in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, as appropriate. 
In addition, the Fund is (and will remain) subject to the diversification rules of the Tax Code. These rules provide that, to maintain favorable tax treatment, the Fund must invest at least 50% of its total assets so that no more than 5% of its total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer, and so that it holds no more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any issuer. With respect to the remaining 50% of its total assets, the Fund is limited to investing 25% in the securities of a single issuer. These limits apply only as of the end of each quarter of the Fund's fiscal year, so the Fund may actually have a higher concentration in an issuer during periods between the ends of its fiscal quarters. However, the Subadviser has no current intention of investing in the securities of any single issuer beyond the Tax Code limits. Like the 1940 Act limits, the Tax Code limits do not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or to securities issued by other investment companies. 
If shareholders of the Fund approve Proposal 2, the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified will become effective when the Fund's registration statement is revised or supplemented to reflect that the fundamental investment limitation requiring diversification no longer applies to the Fund. If shareholders of the Fund do not approve Proposal 2, the Fund will continue to be subject to the fundamental policy requiring diversification and will continue to operate as a "diversified" fund. 
Required Vote: 
Proposal 2 will be voted on by shareholders of Virtus KAR International Small-Cap Fund only, with the Fund's share classes voting  ​
together. To approve Proposal 2, the Fund must receive an affirmative vote of a 1940 Act Majority Vote. Approval of Proposal 2 by shareholders of the Fund is not contingent upon approval of Proposal 1 by shareholders of Virtus KAR Emerging Markets Small-Cap Fund. If the Fund approves Proposal 2 and the other Fund does not approve Proposal 1, the Fund will change its classification to "non-diversified," while the other Fund will remain diversified. 
OTHER INFORMATION
Share and Class Information: 
As of the Record Date, each Fund offered multiple classes of shares to the public pursuant to a Multiple Class Plan adopted by the Board (the "18f-3 Plan"). The 18f-3 Plan sets forth that shares of each class of a Fund represent an equal pro rata interest in the Fund and generally have identical voting, dividend, liquidation, and other rights, preferences, powers, restrictions, limitations, qualifications, terms and conditions, except that each class bears certain class-specific expenses and has separate voting rights on certain matters that relate solely to that class or in which the interests of shareholders of one class differ from the interests of shareholders of another class. 
Ownership of Shares: 
A principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially 5% or more of the outstanding shares of a Fund.

Shareholder Proposals and Trustee Attendance at Annual Meetings of Shareholders: 
Under the provisions of the Trust's charter documents and applicable law, no annual meeting of shareholders is required, and the Trust does not currently intend to hold such a meeting. Ordinarily, there will be no shareholder meeting unless required by the 1940 Act or otherwise. However, if a shareholder meeting is held, it is the policy of the Trust to encourage Trustee attendance at such meetings in person or by teleconference. 
Shareholder proposals for inclusion in the proxy statement for any subsequent meeting must be received by the Trust within a reasonable period of time prior to any such shareholder meeting. Shareholders collectively holding at least 10% of the outstanding shares of the Trust may request a shareholder meeting at any time for the purpose of voting to remove one or more of the Trustees. The Trust will assist in communicating to other shareholders about such meeting.  ​
Shareholder Communications with Board: 
Any shareholder who wishes to send a communication to the Board should send the communication to the attention of the Trust's Secretary at 100 Pearl Street, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. If a shareholder wishes to send a communication directly to an individual Trustee or to a Committee of the Board, then the communication should be specifically addressed to such individual Trustee or Committee and sent in care of the Trust's Secretary at the same address. 
After reviewing the communication, the Trust's Secretary will then promptly forward the communication to the Board. Communications to individual Trustees or to a Committee sent in care of the Trust's Secretary will be promptly forwarded to the individual Trustee or to the Committee, as applicable.
