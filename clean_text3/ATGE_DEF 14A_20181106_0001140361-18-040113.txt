 Align Incentives   Our purpose is to empower our students to achieve their goals, find success and make inspiring contributions to the global community. Success in realizing our purpose drives growth, which leads to creation of sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. Our compensation program is distinguished by its alignment not only with our shareholders, but also with our students, whose success is critical to our organization's success.  
 Compete for Talent   Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate high-performing employees, particularly our key executives who are critical to our operations. Our compensation decisions take into account the competitive landscape for talent.  
 Reward Performance   We reward outstanding performance through:  
  • A short-term incentive program focusing our executives on achieving strong financial results and superior academic and student outcomes, through individual performance objectives, and  
  • A long-term incentive program providing a mix of equity vehicles designed to reward long-term financial performance and shareholder value creation.

 Fiscal year 2018 revenue was below our expectations, while earnings per share, excluding special items, exceeded our expectations, each as reflected in our fiscal year 2018 operating plan, which served as the basis for our fiscal year 2018 MIP financial performance targets. As a result, the portions of executive officer MIP awards based on Adtalem revenue and earnings per share paid out at 74.3% and 115.6% of target, respectively.      
     *Actual results adjusted to exclude impact of    special items. See Appendix A for a reconciliation    to reported results.

 Factors Guiding Our Decisions   (see page 35 for details)• Executive compensation program objectives, philosophy and principles• Shareholder input, including say-on-pay vote  
• Adtalem's mission, vision, purpose and TEACH values• Market norms, trends and best pay practices  
• Financial performance of Adtalem and its individual institutions• Advice of independent outside compensation consultant  
• Student academic performance and outcomes          
 Key Fiscal Year   2018   Compensation   Decisions         (see page 38 for details)   Base Salary         Reflecting Adtalem's commitment to offering market competitive compensation to our key executives, the Compensation Committee approved salary increases in fiscal year 2018 for several NEOs to reward performance and maintain market competitiveness.         Annual Incentives         For fiscal year 2018 for the CEO, 85% of the MIP award was based on Adtalem measures of earnings per share and revenue, reflecting our CEO's key responsibility in leading Adtalem's financial growth. The remaining 15% was based on individual performance. For fiscal year 2018 for the other NEOs, as in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, 70% of the MIP award was based on financial performance at Adtalem (earnings per share and revenue) or at the institutions for which the NEO is responsible (operating income and revenue), and the remaining 30% was based on individual performance.           Following the end of fiscal year 2018, the MIP award in total across all measures was paid at 112% of target for the CEO and between 88% and 129% of target for the other NEOs, excluding Mr. Paul who was not eligible to receive a MIP award, reflecting the strong financial performance of Adtalem and its institutions and individual contributions for fiscal year 2018.   
     Long-term Incentives         In fiscal year 2018, NEOs other than the CEO received long-term incentive grants in a combination of stock options, performance-vesting Performance Share Units ("PSUs"), and service-vesting RSUs.         The CEO's fiscal year 2018 equity grant was a front-loaded, two-year award valued at approximately $9.4 million. The Board and Compensation Committee have determined that this grant represents Ms. Wardell's long-term incentive awards for both fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Ms. Wardell has not received, and will not receive, any form of long-term incentive award in fiscal year 2019. The Board and Compensation Committee approved this grant to drive Ms. Wardell's focus on key academic and financial performance goals over the next several years, and they determined that making a front-loaded, two-year award would underline the importance and critical nature of the performance goals, given the anticipated divestiture of DeVry University and the transformative nature of the corporate changes. Of the total grant value, approximately 50% was in PSUs tied to ROIC and key academic metrics, and 50% was in stock options. The Committee explicitly chose to deliver 100% of this front loaded award through performance-based long-term incentives and chose to exclude any time-based vesting RSUs in this grant as opposed to our historical annual LTI grant approach for named executive officers. The performance period for the PSUs is fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2020 and they will only vest at the end of this three-year period upon achievement of certain academic and financial (ROIC) performance goals discussed later in this section. The stock options will vest 50% after the three year grant date anniversary and 50% after the four year grant date anniversary. This vesting schedule is intended to drive focus on performance over the long-term.           Performance share awards granted in 2015 vested in 2018, with an overall payout of 71% of target, demonstrating that the high standards established for Adtalem's institutions were rigorous.

 What we heard   How we responded  
 Ensure executive compensation plans drive focus on delivering results• Through feedback received from major shareholders, in fiscal year 2018, the Committee chose to reintroduce Earnings Per Share as the key performance measure in our short-term incentive plan (Management Incentive Plan or MIP). We replaced Net Income with Earnings Per Share as the primary performance measure in this plan to create better alignment with shareholders on this key measure.  
• In August 2018, the Committee structured the fiscal year 2019 long-term incentive grants to be focused on key financial metrics, namely Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Free Cash Flow Per Share. We believe this increased focus on driving value creation through our long-term incentive plan better aligns our compensation programs with the interests of shareholders.   
 Drive a growth mentality and get Adtalem's portfolio aligned for future growth• The Committee decided to grant a two-year front-loaded long-term incentive award to our CEO in fiscal year 2018, with no fiscal year 2019 long-term incentive grant of any kind. This award was delivered exclusively through growth oriented long-term incentive vehicles – stock options with a back end loaded vesting term and PSUs that vest solely based on the achievement of meeting performance goals over a three-year period. The Board and Compensation Committee approved this grant to drive Ms. Wardell's focus on critically important academic and financial performance metrics over the next several years.

 What we heard   How we responded  
 Academic quality leads to growth and value creation for shareholders• Through the Committee's review of our key strategies and our executive compensation program, it was clear delivering quality academic and student outcomes continues to be a critical element of our long-term success. The decision to shift measurement of academic outcomes into the MIP strengthens that focus year in and year out with meaningful stretch annual goals.

 Annual Cash Incentive Compensation        
 The annual cash incentive, delivered through the MIP, provides NEOs with the opportunity to earn rewards based on the achievement of organizational and institutional performance and, to a lesser extent, individual performance.             
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 HOW THE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN WORKS           
 MIP target award opportunities for each NEO are set by the Compensation Committee based on factors including external surveys of practices for positions with similar levels of responsibility. These targets, which are expressed as a percentage of base salary, are then reviewed at the beginning of each fiscal year based on updated market compensation data.           The MIP provided Adtalem's CEO with a target award opportunity of 105% of base salary and other NEOs target award opportunities between 50% and 70% of base salary. For fiscal year 2018, the target award opportunity for Mr. Unzicker increased to 70% (from 65%). No other changes were made to the MIP target award opportunity as a percentage of base salary for the other NEOs.          Actual awards can be higher or lower than the target opportunity based on the results for each performance measure. Performance below threshold for the goal will result in no payment for that performance goal. On the other hand, performance at or above threshold can earn an award ranging from 50% to 200% of the target amount. The maximum amount of 200% rewards exceptional performance compared to expectations, over-delivery of strategic initiatives, and/or achievement of initiatives not contemplated at the time goals were set.

 STOCK OPTIONS: Stock options reward long-term value creation through increases in stock price. To promote retention, stock option grants vest in equal installments over a four-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the NEO's continuous service at Adtalem (except for the grant to the CEO this fiscal year, which vests 50% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date). The Compensation Committee granted incentive stock options (ISOs) with a value of up to the $100,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limitation applicable to each one-year vesting period. To the extent this limitation was met for any NEO, the remaining portion of the stock option award was issued in the form of non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee recognizes that Adtalem may not receive a tax deduction for ISOs, but weighed this consideration against the tax benefit ISOs provide to employees and the additional enhancement to Adtalem's ability to attract and retain executives. The Compensation Committee determined it was in Adtalem's best interest to continue utilizing ISOs in the manner described.         RSUs: RSUs align the interests of management with those of shareholders and reward long-term value creation. To promote retention, RSUs vest in equal installments over a four-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the NEO's continuous service at Adtalem.

 Stock Ownership Guidelines         Stock ownership guidelines are in place for all directors and executive officers of Adtalem and are intended to align their interests with our shareholders by requiring them to be subject to the same long-term stock price volatility our shareholders experience. Mr. Malafronte, who was appointed to the Board pursuant to a Support Agreement between Adtalem and a shareholder, IVA, and who has declined all compensation for his service, is not subject to the ownership guidelines.           Directors and executive officers are expected to maintain ownership of Adtalem's Common Stock valued equal to or in excess of a multiple of their current base salary or annual retainer:
