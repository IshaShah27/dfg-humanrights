PROXY STATEMENT
FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD DECEMBER 12, 2018
The Board of Directors of Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. (the "Company" or "we" or "us") is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the "Annual Meeting"). Distribution of this Proxy Statement and a Proxy Form is scheduled to begin on November 8, 2018. The mailing address of the Company's principal executive offices is 1603 LBJ Freeway, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas 75234.
About the Meeting
Who Can Vote
Record holders of Common Stock of the Company at the close of business on Monday, November 5, 2018 (the "Record Date"), may vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, 8,717,767 shares of Common Stock were outstanding. Each share is entitled to cast one vote.
How Can You Vote
If you return your signed proxy before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct. You can specify whether your shares should be voted for all, some or none of the nominees for director. You can also specify whether you approve, disapprove or abstain from the other proposal to ratify the selection of auditors.
If a proxy is executed and returned but no instructions are given, the shares will be voted according to the recommendations of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposals 1 and 2.
Revocation of Proxies
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (a) delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary, (b) delivering another proxy that is dated later than the original proxy, or (c) casting your vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Your last vote will be the vote that is counted.
Vote Required
The holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are either present in person or represented by a proxy at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. As of November 5, 2018, there were 8,717,767 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast at least 4,358,884 votes constitutes a quorum for adopting the proposals at the Annual Meeting. If you have properly signed and returned your proxy card by mail, you will be considered part of the quorum, and the persons named on the proxy card will vote your shares as you have instructed. If the broker holding your shares in "street" name
-1-
indicates to us on a proxy card that the broker lacks discretionary authority to vote your shares, we will not consider your shares as present or entitled to vote for any purpose.
A plurality of the votes cast is required for the election of directors. This means that the director nominee with the most votes for a particular slot is elected to that slot. A proxy that has properly withheld authority with respect to the election of one or more directors will not be voted with respect to the director or directors indicated, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum.
For the other proposal, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval. An abstention with respect to such proposal will not be voted, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. Accordingly, an abstention will have the effect of a negative vote.
As of the Record Date, affiliates held 7,375,402 shares representing approximately 84.60% of the shares outstanding. These affiliates have advised the Company that they currently intend to vote all of their shares in favor of the approval of both proposals.
If you received multiple proxy cards, this indicates that your shares are held in more than one account, such as two brokerage accounts, and are registered in different names. You should vote each of the proxy cards to ensure that all your shares are voted.
Other Matters to be Acted Upon at the Annual Meeting
We do not know of any other matters to be validly presented or acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Under our Bylaws, no business besides that stated in the Annual Meeting Notice may be transacted at any meeting of stockholders. If any other matter is presented at the Annual Meeting on which a vote may be properly taken, the shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting those shares.
Expenses of Solicitation
The Company is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. Some of our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies personally, without any additional compensation, by telephone or mail. Proxy materials will also be furnished without cost to brokers and other nominees to forward to the beneficial owners of shares held in their names.

Corporate Governance and Board Matters
The affairs of the Company are managed by the Board of Directors. The Directors are elected at the annual meeting of stockholders each year or appointed by the incumbent Board of Directors and serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor has been elected or approved.
During the past few years, changes occurred in the membership of the Board of Directors. Martha C. Stephens and RL S. Lemke were elected directors on February 1, 2011 and each resigned on October 13, 2011. On October 25, 2011, the Board of Directors reelected Sharon Hunt (a director from February 20, 2004, to January 31, 2011) as a director; she resigned due to health reasons on May 3, 2016, and passed away on June 5, 2016. On June 2, 2016, the Board of Directors elected Raymond D. Roberts, Sr. as a director to replace Ms. Hunt.
Current members of the Board
The members of the Board of Directors on the date of this proxy statement, and the committees of the Board on which they serve, are identified below:
Role of the Board's Committees
The Board of Directors has standing Audit, Compensation and Governance and Nominating Committees.
Audit Committee. The functions of the Audit Committee are described below under the heading "Report of the Audit Committee." The charter of the Audit Committee was adopted on February 19, 2004, and is available on the Company's Investor Relations website (www.transconrealty-invest.com). All of the members of the Audit Committee are independent within the meaning of SEC regulations, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Munselle, a member and Chair of the Audit Committee, is qualified as an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations and the Board has determined that he has accounting and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. All of the members of the Audit Committee meet the independence and experience requirements of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Audit Committee met five times during 2017.
Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for developing and implementing policies and practices relating to corporate governance, including reviewing and monitoring implementation of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition, the Governance and Nominating Committee develops and reviews background information on
-4-
candidates for the Board and makes recommendations to the Board regarding such candidates. The Governance and Nominating Committee also prepares and supervises the Board's annual review of director independence and the Board's performance self-evaluation. The charter of the Governance and Nominating Committee was adopted on March 17, 2004, and is available on the Company's Investor Relations website (www.transconrealty-invest.com). All of the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Governance and Nominating Committee met two times during 2017.
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the policies of the Company relating to compensation to be paid by the Company to the Company's principal executive officer and any other officers designated by the Board and make recommendations to the Board with respect to such policies, produce necessary reports on executive compensation for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement in accordance with applicable rules and regulations and to monitor the development and implementation of succession plans for the principal executive officer and other key executives and make recommendations to the Board with respect to such plans. The charter of the Compensation Committee was adopted on March 17, 2004, and is available on the Company's Investor Relations website (www.transconrealty-invest.com). All of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Compensation Committee is to be comprised of at least two directors who are independent of management and the Company. The Compensation Committee met two times during 2017.
Presiding Director
In May 2004, the Board created a new position of Presiding Director, whose primary responsibility is to preside over periodic executive sessions of the Board in which management directors and other members of management do not participate. The Presiding Director also advises the Chairman of the Board and, as appropriate, Committee chairs with respect to agendas and information needs relating to Board and Committee meetings, provides advice with respect to the selection of Committee chairs and performs other duties that the Board may from time to time delegate to assist the Board in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. In December 2017, the nonmanagement members of the Board designated Ted R. Munselle to serve in this position until the Company's annual meeting of stockholders to be held following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Selection of Nominees for the Board
The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider candidates for Board membership suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as management and stockholders. The Governance and Nominating Committee may also retain a third-party executive search firm to identify candidates upon request of the Governance and Nominating Committee from time to time. A stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify the Company's Corporate Secretary or any member of the Governance and Nominating Committee in writing with whatever supporting material the stockholder considers appropriate. The Governance and Nominating Committee will also consider whether to nominate any person nominated by a stockholder pursuant to the provisions of the Company's bylaws relating to stockholder nominations.
Once the Governance and Nominating Committee has identified a prospective nominee, the Governance and Nominating Committee will make an initial determination as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate. This initial determination will be based on whatever information is provided to the Governance and Nominating Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Governance and Nominating Committee's own knowledge of the prospective candidate, which may
-5-
be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. The preliminary determination will be based primarily on the need for additional Board members to fill vacancies or expand the size of the Board and the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the evaluation factors described below. If the Governance and Nominating Committee determines, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and other Board members as appropriate, that additional consideration is warranted, it may request the third-party search firm to gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and to report its findings to the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee will then evaluate the prospective nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, including:
The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers such other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board, the balance of management and independent directors, the need for Audit Committee expertise and the evaluations of other prospective nominees. In connection with this evaluation, the Governance and Nominating Committee determines whether to interview the prospective nominee, and if warranted, one or more members of the Governance and Nominating Committee, and others as appropriate, interview prospective nominees in person or by telephone. After completing this evaluation and interview, the Governance and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board as to the persons who should be nominated by the Board, and the Board determines the nominees after considering the recommendation and report of the Governance and Nominating Committee.
The Bylaws of the Company provide that any stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholders' intention to make such nomination has been delivered personally to, or has been mailed to and received by the Secretary at the principal office of the Company not later than 35 nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting. If a stockholder has a suggestion for candidates for election, the stockholder should follow this procedure. Each notice from a stockholder must set forth (i) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and the name of the person to be nominated, (ii) the class and number of shares of stock held of record, owned beneficially and represented by proxy by such stockholder as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date of such notice, (iii) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person specified
-6-
in the notice, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each nominee and any other person (naming those persons) pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by such stockholder, (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules, and (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. The Chairman of the Annual Meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with this procedure.
Determinations of Director Independence
In February 2004, the Board enhanced its Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Guidelines adopted by the Board meet or exceed the new listing standards adopted during that year by the NYSE. The full text of the Guidelines can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website (www.transcontrealty-invest.com). A copy may also be obtained upon request from the Company's Corporate Secretary.
Pursuant to the Guidelines, the Board undertook its annual review of director independence in May 2017. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those reported under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below. The Board also examined transactions and relationships between directors or their affiliates and members of the Company's senior management or their affiliates. As provided in the Guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent.
As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that Directors Ted R. Munselle, Robert A. Jakuszewski, and Raymond D. Roberts, Sr. are each independent of the Company and its management under the standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Directors' Service for Other Publicly Held Entities
Each of Ted R. Munselle and Raymond D. Roberts, Sr. serves as a member of the Audit Committee of this Company as well as two other corporations which are part of a consolidated group for financial statement reporting purposes, all of which are involved in the real estate industry, the common stock of each of which is listed and available for trading on the NYSE and/or NYSE American. Each also serves on one other Board of Directors and Audit Committee, thus making four entities for which each of Messrs. Munselle and Roberts serves in a similar capacity. The Board has determined, after discussion, that the fact that three of the entities are part of a consolidated group requires each of Messrs. Munselle and Roberts to be familiar with the financial reporting requirements and standards of each of those entities due to the fact of consolidation and does not create an additional burden upon either Mr. Munselle or Mr. Roberts but also confers a benefit on each of those three entities, as it may well save on each of Messrs. Munselle's and Roberts' time and responsibility. The three consolidated entities and each of the other entities have no specific policy or prohibition upon either Mr. Munselle's or Mr. Roberts' or any other person's service to any other publicly held entities, but the members of this Board periodically review other relationships among Committee and Board members with other independent entities to ensure that no conflict exists and, in fact, have confirmed that each of Messrs. Munselle's and Roberts' service to other entities in other industries benefits the expertise of each of Messrs. Munselle and Roberts and the Company.

Board Meetings During Fiscal 2017
The Board met six times during fiscal 2017. No incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board and Committees on which he or she served. Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, each Director is expected to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent performance of his or her duties, including by attending meetings of the stockholders of the Company, the Board and Committees of which he or she is a member. In addition, the independent directors met in executive session four times during fiscal 2017.
Directors' Compensation
Each nonemployee director is currently entitled to receive an annual retainer of $12,000 plus reimbursement for expenses. Prior to January 4, 2010, when the Board of Directors reduced fees, each nonemployee director was entitled to an annual retainer of $30,000. The Chairman of the Board does not currently receive any additional fee per year. The Chairman of the Audit Committee receives an annual fee of $500. In addition, each independent director receives an additional fee of $1,000 per day for any special services rendered to the Company outside of his or her ordinary duties as a director plus reimbursement of expenses. The Company also reimburses directors for travel expenses incurred in connection with attending Board, committee and stockholder meetings and for other Company/business related expenses. Directors who are also employees of the Company or its Advisor receive no additional compensation for service as a director.
During 2017, $36,500 was paid to the nonemployee directors in total directors' fees for all services, including the annual fee for service during the period from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, and special service fees. Those fees received by directors were Raymond D. Roberts, Sr. ($12,000), Ted Munselle ($12,500), and Robert A. Jakuszewski ($12,000).
On October 10, 2000, the stockholders of the Company approved the Directors Stock Option Plan (the "Directors Plan") which provides for the availability of options to purchase shares of Common Stock. The Directors Plan provides for automatic annual grants of options to directors of the Company who, at the time of grant of an option are not, and have not been for at least one year, either an employee or officer of the Company or any of its affiliates. Options granted pursuant to the Directors Plan are immediately exercisable and expire on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date on which a director ceases to be a director or ten years from the date of grant. Each nonemployee director was granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares on January 1 of each year. The exercise price of shares issued pursuant to each option was to be 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant of each option. The Directors Plan was terminated by the Board of Directors on December 15, 2005. All options expired January 1, 2015, unexercised.
Stockholders' Communication with the Board
Stockholders and other parties interested in communicating directly with the Presiding Director or with the nonmanagement directors as a group may do so by writing to Ted R. Munselle, Director, Post Office Box 830163, Richardson, Texas 75083-0163. Effective March 22, 2004, the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board also approved a process for handling letters received by the Company and addressed to members of the Board but received at the Company. Under that process, the Corporate Secretary of the Company reviews all such correspondence and regularly forwards to the Board a summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Corporate Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or committees thereof or that he otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time review a log of all correspondence received by the Company that is addressed to
-8-
members of the Board and received by the Company and request copies of any such correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of the Chairman of the Audit Committee and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters.
Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all directors, officers and employees (including those of the Contractual Advisor). In addition, the Company has adopted a code of ethics entitled "Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers" that applies to the principal executive officer, president, principal financial officer, chief financial officer, the principal accounting officer and controller. The text of both documents is available on the Company's Investor Relations website (www.transconrealty-invest.com). The Company intends to post amendments to or waivers from its Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers (to the extent applicable to the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer) at this location on its website.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of Reporting Requirements
Section 16(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's directors, executive officers and any persons holding 10% or more of the Company's shares of Common Stock to report their ownership of the Company's shares of Common Stock and any changes in that ownership to the SEC on specified report forms. Specific due dates for these reports have been established, and the Company is required to report any failure to file by these dates during each fiscal year. All of these filing requirements were satisfied by the Company's directors and executive officers and holders of more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In making these statements, the Company has relied upon the written representations of its directors and executive officers and the holders of 10% or more of the Company's Common Stock and copies of the reports that each has filed with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 2
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has appointed Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the 2018 fiscal year and to conduct quarterly reviews through September 30, 2018. The Company's Bylaws do not require that stockholders ratify the appointment of Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. has served as the Company's independent public accounting firm for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 through 2017. The Audit Committee will consider the outcome of this vote in its decision to appoint an independent registered public accounting firm next year, however, it is not bound by the stockholders' decision. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
A representative of Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. will attend the Annual Meeting. The representative will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from the stockholders.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the   appointment of Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. as the   Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 Audit Firm Fee Summary
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees for professional services rendered to or for the Company for the years 2016 and 2017 by Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C.:
The audit fees for 2016 and 2017, respectively, were for professional services rendered for the audits and reviews of the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Tax fees for 2016 and 2017, respectively, were for services related to federal and state compliance and advice.
 -13-
All services rendered by the principal auditors are permissible under applicable laws and regulations and were preapproved by either the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee, as required by law. The fees paid the principal auditors for services as described in the above table fall under the categories listed below:
Audit Fees. These are fees for professional services performed by the principal auditor for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in the Company's 10-Q filings and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filing or engagements.
Audit-Related Fees. These are fees for assurance and related services performed by the principal auditor that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements. These services include attestations by the principal auditor that are not required by statute or regulation and consulting on financial accounting/reporting standards.
Tax Fees. These are fees for professional services performed by the principal auditor with respect to tax compliance, tax planning, tax consultation, returns preparation and review of returns. The review of tax returns includes the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
All Other Fees. These are fees for other permissible work performed by the principal auditor that do not meet the above category descriptions.
These services are actively monitored (as to both spending level and work content) by the Audit Committee to maintain the appropriate objectivity and independence in the principal auditor's core work, which is the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of three directors, each of whom satisfies the requirements of independence, experience and financial literacy under the requirements of the NYSE and the SEC. The Audit Committee has directed the preparation of this report and has approved its content and submission to the stockholders.
The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things:
 -14-
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's responsibilities are set forth in this charter which is available on our website at www.transconrealty-invest.com.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for general oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the adequacy of the Company's system of internal controls, the Company's risk management, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, and the performance of the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee has sole authority over the selection of the Company's independent auditors and manages the Company's relationship with its independent auditors. The Audit Committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting or other advisors as the Audit Committee deems necessary to carry out its duties and receive appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, from the Company for such advice and assistance.
The Audit Committee met five times during 2017. The Audit Committee schedules its meetings with a view to ensuring that it devotes appropriate attention to all of its tasks. The Audit Committee's meetings include private sessions with the Company's independent auditors without the presence of the Company's management, as well as executive sessions consisting of only Audit Committee members. The Audit Committee also meets senior management from time to time.
Management has the primary responsibility for the Company's financial reporting process, including its system of internal control over financial reporting and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements in accordance with professional standards and expressing an opinion as to their material conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and for auditing management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review the Company's financial reporting process and discuss management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. It is not the Audit Committee's duty or responsibility to conduct audits or accounting reviews or procedures. The Audit Committee has relied, without independent verification, on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and on the opinion of the independent registered public accountants included in their report on the Audit Committee's financial statements.
As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with both management and the Company's independent registered public accountants all annual and quarterly financial statements prior to their issuance. During 2017, management advised the Audit Committee that each set of financial statements reviewed had been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and reviewed significant accounting and disclosure issues with the Audit Committee. These reviews include discussions with the independent accountants of the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards), including the quality (not merely the acceptability) of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements and disclosures related to critical accounting practices. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. matters relating to its independence, including a review of audit and non-audit fees, and written disclosures from Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. to the Company pursuant to Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees). The
 -15-
Audit Committee also considered whether non-audit services, provided by the independent accountants are compatible with the independent accountant's independence. The Company also received regular updates on the amount of fees and scope of audit, audit related, and tax services provided.
In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed key initiatives and programs aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of the Company's internal and disclosure control structure. As part of this process, the Audit Committee continued to monitor the scope and adequacy of the Company's internal controls, reviewed staffing levels and steps taken to implement recommended improvements in any internal procedures and controls.
Based on the Audit Committee's discussion with management and the independent accountants and the Audit Committee's review of the representation of management and the report of the independent accountants to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have also selected Farmer, Fuqua & Huff, P.C. as the Company's independent registered public accountants and auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The members of the Audit Committee discussed the fact that Ted Munselle serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the qualified Audit Committee financial expert within the meaning of SEC Regulations and that he has the accounting and related financial management expertise within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE with respect to this corporation, as well as two other corporations which are part of a consolidated group for financial statement purposes, and that he serves in a similar capacity for an unrelated corporation involved in another industry, the Common Stock of which is available for trading in the Over-the-Counter ("OTC") Market, thus making four entities for which he serves in a similar capacity. The Audit Committee has determined, after discussion, that the fact that three entities are part of a consolidated group requires Mr. Munselle to be familiar with the financial reporting requirements and standards of each of those entities due to the fact of consolidation and does not create an additional burden upon Mr. Munselle but, in fact, confers a benefit on each of the entities, as it may well save on Mr. Munselle's time and responsibility. While this entity and the other two consolidated entities have no specific policy or prohibition upon Mr. Munselle or any other person's service to other publicly held entities, the members of this Committee periodically review other relationships among Committee and Board members with other independent entities to ensure that no conflict exists and, in fact, have confirmed that service to other entities in other industries benefits the expertise of the individuals involved.
Pre-approval Policy for Audit and Non-Audit Services
Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "SO Act"), and the rules of the SEC, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor. The purpose of the provisions of the SO Act and the SEC rules for the Audit Committee role in retaining the independent registered public accounting firm is twofold. First, the authority and responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the auditors should be with directors who are independent of management. Second, any non-audit work performed by the auditors should be reviewed and approved by these same independent directors to ensure that any non-audit services performed by the auditor do not impair the independence of the independent auditor. To implement the
 -16-
provisions of the SO Act, the SEC issued rules specifying the types of services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, and governing the Audit Committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. As part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee is required to preapprove the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that they do not impair the auditor's independence. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted a written pre-approval policy of audit and non-audit services (the "Policy"), which sets forth the procedures and conditions pursuant to which services to be performed by the independent auditor are to be preapproved. Consistent with the SEC rules establishing two different approaches to approving non-prohibited services, the policy of the Audit Committee covers pre-approval of audit services, audit-related services, international administration tax services, non-U.S. income tax compliance services, pension and benefit plan consulting and compliance services, and U.S. tax compliance and planning. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Audit Committee will evaluate other known potential engagements of the independent auditor, including the scope of work proposed to be performed and the proposed fees, and approve or reject each service, taking into account whether services are permissible under applicable law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the independent auditor's independence from management. Typically, in addition to the generally preapproved services, other services would include due diligence for an acquisition that may or may not have been known at the beginning of the year. The Audit Committee has also delegated to any member of the Audit Committee designated by the Board or the financial expert member of the Audit Committee responsibilities to preapprove services to be performed by the independent auditor not exceeding $25,000 in value or cost per engagement of audit and non-audit services, and such authority may only be exercised when the Audit Committee is not in session.
Executive Compensation
The Company has no employees, payroll or benefit plans and pays no compensation to its executive officers. The executive officers of the Company who are also officers or employees of Pillar, the Company's advisor, are compensated by Pillar. Such executive officers perform a variety of services for Pillar and the amount of their compensation is determined solely by Pillar. Pillar does not allocate the cash compensation of its officers among the various entities for which it serves as advisor. See "The Advisor" for a discussion of the compensation payable to Pillar under the Advisory Agreement.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is comprised of at least two directors who are independent of management and the Company. Each member of the Compensation Committee must be determined to be independent by the Board under the Corporate Governance Guidelines on Director Independence adopted by the Board and under the NYSE standards for nonemployee directors and Rule 16b-3(b)(3)(i) of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the requirements for "outside directors" set forth in Treasury Regulations, Section 27(e)(3). Each member of the Compensation Committee is to be free of any relationship that in the judgment of the Board from time to time may interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment. Each Compensation Committee member is appointed annually subject to removal at any time by the Board and serves until his or her Compensation Committee appointment is terminated by the Board. The Compensation Committee is composed of three directors, each of whom meets the standards described above.
The purposes of the Compensation Committee are to oversee the policies of the Company relating to compensation to be paid by the Company to the Company's principal executive officer ("CEO") and any other officers designated by the Board and make recommendations to the Board with respect to such policies, produce necessary reports and executive compensation for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, and monitor the development and implementation of
 -17-
succession plans for the CEO and other key executives and make recommendations to the Board with respect to such plans.
The Company has no employees, payroll or benefit plans and pays no compensation to its executive officers. The executive officers of the Company, who are also officers or employees of Pillar, are compensated by Pillar. Such executive officers perform a variety of services for Pillar, and the amount of their compensation is determined solely by Pillar. Pillar does not allocate the cash compensation of its officers among the various entities for which it may serve as advisor or sub-advisor.
The only remuneration paid by the Company is to directors who are not officers or directors of Pillar. These independent directors (i) review the business plan of the Company to determine that it is the best interest of the stockholders, (ii) review the advisory contract and recommend any appropriate changes thereto, (iii) supervise the performance of the Company's advisor, and review the reasonableness of the compensation paid to the advisor in terms of the nature and quality of services performed, (iv) review the reasonableness of the total fees and expenses of the Company, and (v) select, when necessary, a qualified, independent real estate appraiser to appraise properties to be acquired. See the sub caption "Directors' Compensation" in the Proxy Statement for a description of the compensation paid.
The Charter of the Compensation Committee was adopted on March 22, 2004, and the members of the Compensation Committee, all of whom are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, are listed below. Since its formation on March 22, 2004, the Compensation Committee has annually reviewed its existing charter and regularly performed the tasks described above relating to the business plan, advisory contract, reasonableness of compensation paid to the advisor, and the reasonableness of the total fees and expenses of the Company.

The Advisor
Although the Board of Directors is directly responsible for managing the affairs of the Company and for setting the policies which guide it, day-to-day operations are performed by a contractual advisor under the supervision of the Board of Directors. The duties of the advisor include, among other things, locating, investigating, evaluating and recommending real estate and mortgage note investment and sales opportunities, as well as financing and refinancing sources. The advisor also serves as a consultant to the Board of Directors in connection with the business plan and investment decisions made by the Board.
 -19-
Pillar is the contractual advisor to the Company. Pillar is a Nevada corporation which is owned by Realty Advisors, LLC ("RALLC"), a Nevada limited liability company, the sole member of which is RAI, which is 100% owned by MRHI, the sole stockholder of which is a trust known as the May Trust, which is a trust for the benefit of the children of Gene E. Phillips. Pillar is a company of which Messrs. Moos, Bertcher, and Corna serve as executive officers. Mr. Phillips is not an officer or director of Pillar, RAI or MRHI, nor is he a Trustee of the May Trust.
Under the Advisory Agreement, Pillar is required to annually formulate and submit for Board approval a budget and business plan containing a twelve-month forecast of operations and cash flow, a general plan for asset sales and purchases, borrowing activity and other investments. Pillar is required to report to the Board, on a quarterly basis, the Company's performance against the business plan. In addition, all transactions require prior Board approval, unless they are explicitly provided for in the approved plan or are made pursuant to authority expressly delegated to Pillar by the Board.
The Advisory Agreement also requires prior approval of the Board for the retention of all consultants and third party professionals, other than legal counsel. The Advisory Agreement provides that Pillar shall be deemed to be in a fiduciary relationship to the stockholders; contains a broad standard governing Pillar's liability for losses by the Company; and contains guidelines for Pillar's allocation of investment opportunities as among itself, the Company and other entities it advises.
The Advisory Agreement provides for the advisor to receive monthly base compensation at the rate of 0.0625% per month (0.75% on an annualized basis) of average gross asset value (total assets less allowance for amortization, depreciation or depletion and valuation reserves) and an annual net income fee equal to 7.5% of the Company's net income.
The Advisory Agreement also provides for Pillar to receive an annual incentive sales fee equal to 10% of the amount, if any, by which the aggregate sales consideration for all real estate sold by the Company during such fiscal year exceeds the sum of: (i) the cost of each such property originally recorded in the Company's books for tax purposes (without deduction for depreciation, amortization or reserve for losses), (ii) capital improvements made to such assets during the period owned, and (iii) all closing costs, (including real estate commissions) incurred in the sale of such real estate; provided, however, no incentive fee shall be paid unless (a) such real estate sold in such fiscal year, in the aggregate, has produced 8% simple annual return on the net investment including capital improvements, calculated over the holding period before depreciation and inclusive of operating income and sale consideration, and (b) the aggregate net operating income from all real estate owned for each of the prior and current fiscal years shall be at least 5% higher in the current fiscal year than in the prior fiscal year.
Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, Pillar or an affiliate of Pillar is to receive an acquisition commission for supervising the acquisition, purchase or long-term lease of real estate equal to the lesser of (i) up to 1% of the cost of acquisition, inclusive of commissions, if any, paid to nonaffiliated brokers, or (ii) the compensation customarily charged in arm's length transactions by others rendering similar property acquisition services as an ongoing public activity in the same geographical location and for comparable property, provided that the aggregate purchase price of each property (including acquisition fees and real estate brokerage commissions) may not exceed such property's appraised value at acquisition. Pillar does not receive any commission or acquisitions from an affiliated or related party.
The Advisory Agreement requires Pillar or any affiliate of Pillar to pay to the Company one half of any compensation received from third parties with respect to the origination, placement or brokerage of any loan made by the Company; provided, however, that the compensation retained by Pillar or any affiliate of
 -20-
Pillar shall not exceed the lesser of (i) 2% of the amount of the loan commitment, or (ii) a loan brokerage and commitment fee which is reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
The Advisory Agreement also provides that Pillar or an affiliate of Pillar is to receive a mortgage or loan acquisition fee with respect to the acquisition or purchase of any existing mortgage loan by the Company equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the amount of the loan purchased, or (ii) a brokerage and commitment fee which is reasonable and fair under the circumstances. Such fee will not be paid in connection with the origination or funding of any mortgage loan by the Company.
Under the Advisory Agreement, Pillar or an affiliate of Pillar also is to receive a mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fee for obtaining loans or refinancing on properties equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the amount of the loan or the amount refinanced, or (ii) a brokerage or refinancing fee which is reasonable and fair under the circumstances; provided, however, that no such fee shall be paid on loans from Pillar or an affiliate of Pillar without the approval of the Company's Board of Directors. No fee shall be paid on loan extensions.
The Advisory Agreement also provides that for all activities in connection with or related to construction for the Company and its subsidiaries, Pillar shall receive a fee equal to 6% of the so-called "hard costs" only of any costs of construction on a completed basis, based upon amounts set forth as approved on any architect certificate issued in connection with such construction, which fee is payable at such time as the applicable architect certifies others costs for payment to third parties. The phrase "hard costs" means all actual costs of construction paid to contractors, subcontractors, and third parties for material or labor performed as part of the construction but does not include items generally regarded as "soft costs," which are consulting fees, attorneys' fees, architectural fees, permit fees and fees of other professionals.
Under the Advisory Agreement, Pillar receives reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by it in the performance of advisory services. Under the Advisory Agreement, all or a portion of the annual advisory fee must be refunded by the advisor if the Operating Expenses of the Company (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) exceed certain limits specified in the Advisory Agreement based on the book value, net of asset value and net income of the Company during the fiscal year.
If and to the extent that the Company shall request of Pillar, or any director, officer, partner or employee of Pillar, to render services to the Company other than those required to be rendered by Pillar under the Advisory Agreement, such additional services, if performed, will be compensated separately on terms agreed upon between such party and the Company from time to time.
The Advisory Agreement automatically renews from year to year unless terminated in accordance with its terms. Management believes that the terms of the Advisory Agreement are at least as fair as could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
Situations may develop in which the interests of the Company are in conflict with those of one or more directors or officers in their individual capacities or of Pillar, or of their respective affiliates. In addition to services performed for the Company, Pillar actively provides similar services as agent for, and advisor to, other real estate enterprises, including persons and entities involved in real estate developing and financing, including ARL, IOR, and the Company. The Advisory Agreement provides that Pillar may also serve as advisor to those entities.
As advisor, Pillar is a fiduciary of the Company's public investors. In determining to which entity a particular investment opportunity will be allocated, Pillar will consider the respective investment objectives of each entity and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each such entity's existing
 -21-
mortgage note and real estate portfolio and business plan. To the extent any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one such entity, such investment opportunity will be allocated to the entity that has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among various entities.
Effective April 30, 2011, the Company and Pillar entered into a Cash Management Agreement to further define the administration of the Company's day-to-day investment operations, relationship contacts, flow of funds and deposit and borrowing of funds. Under the Cash Management Agreement, all funds of the Company are delivered to Pillar which has a deposit liability to the Company and is responsible for payment of all payables and investment of all excess funds which earn interest at the Wall Street Journal Pillar Rate plus 1% per annum, as set quarterly on the first day of each calendar quarter. Borrowings for the benefit of the Company bear the same interest rate. The term of the Cash Management Agreement is coterminous with the Advisory Agreement, and it is automatically renewed each year unless terminated with the Advisory Agreement.
Pillar may assign the Advisory Agreement only with the prior consent of the Company.
The directors and principal executive officers of Pillar are set forth below:
Property Management
Effective January 1, 2011, Regis Realty Prime, LLC d/b/a Regis Property Management, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("Regis"), the sole member of which is RALLC, has managed the Company's commercial properties for a fee of 3% or less of the monthly gross rents collected on any commercial properties Regis manages and leasing commissions of 6% or less in accordance with the terms of a property level management agreement.
Real Estate Brokerage

Regis is entitled to receive a real estate commission for property purchases and sales in accordance with a sliding scale of total fees to be paid (i) maximum fee of 4.5% on the first $2 million of any purchase or sale transaction of which no more than 3.5% would be paid to Regis or affiliates; (ii) maximum fee of 3.5% on transaction amounts between $2 million and $5 million, of which no more than 3% would be paid to Regis or affiliates; (iii) maximum fee of 2.5% on transaction amounts between $5 million and $10 million, of which no more than 2% would be paid to Regis or affiliates; and (iv) maximum fee of 2% on transaction amounts in excess of $10 million, of which no more than 1.5% would be paid to Regis or affiliates.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Certain Business Relationships
Pillar, the Company's advisor, is a company for which Messrs. Moos, Bertcher, and Corna serve as executive officers. The executive officers of the Company also serve as executive officers of ARL and IOR and owe fiduciary duties to each of those entities, as well as to Pillar, under applicable law. ARL and IOR each have the same relationship with Pillar as does the Company. Mr. Bertcher is also an officer and director of GBR, and Mr. Roberts is a director of GBR, and, as such, each owes fiduciary duties to GBR.
The Company contracts with affiliates of Pillar for property management and brokerage services.
The Company owns an equity interest in IOR. At December 31, 2017, the Company owned, and at present continues to own, 3,381,270 shares of IOR Common Stock which comprises over 81% of IOR's outstanding common stock. Henry A. Butler, Robert A. Jakuszewski, Ted R. Munselle and Raymond D. Roberts, Sr., directors of the Company, are also members of the Board of Directors of IOR. ARL, directly and through a wholly owned subsidiary, owns approximately 83% of outstanding common stock of the Company; all of the Directors of the Company are also Directors of ARL.
Tax Sharing Agreement
For tax periods ending before August 31, 2012, the Company was part of the ARL consolidated federal return. After that date, the Company and the rest of the ARL group (ARL and IOR) joined the MRHI consolidated group for tax purposes. The income tax expense (benefit) for 2010 and 2011 tax periods was calculated under a tax sharing and compensating agreement among the Company, ARL, and IOR. That agreement continued until August 31, 2012, at which time the new tax sharing and compensating agreement was entered into among the Company, ARL, IOR, and MRHI for the remainder of 2012. For 2012, the Company, ARL, and IOR had a combined net taxable loss. The benefit or expense under such arrangements is calculated based upon the amount of losses absorbed by taxable income multiplied by the statutory rate of 35% per the tax sharing and compensating agreements.
Related Party Transactions
Historically, the Company, ARL, IOR and Pillar have each engaged in, and may continue to engage in, business transactions, including real estate partnerships, with related parties. Management believes that all of the related party transactions represented the best investments available at the time and were at least as advantageous to the Company as could have been obtained from unrelated parties.
TCI paid advisory fees of $10 million, net income fees of $300,000, mortgage brokerage and equity refinancing fees of $1,600,000, cost reimbursements of $2.9 million, and received interest income of $4.9 million from Pillar in 2017.
