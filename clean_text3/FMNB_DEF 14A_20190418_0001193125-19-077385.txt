GENERAL INFORMATION 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Farmers National Banc Corp., an Ohio corporation ("Farmers" or the "Company"), of the accompanying proxy to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"), and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Annual Meeting will be held Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time at the Company's headquarters, 20 South Broad Street, Canfield, Ohio 44406 and via the Internet at www.meetingcenter.io/257959543, where you will be able to vote electronically and submit questions during the meeting. The mailing address of the principal executive offices of Farmers is 20 South Broad Street, Canfield, Ohio 44406; telephone number (330) 533-3341. This proxy statement, together with the related proxy and Farmers' 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders (the "Annual Report"), are being mailed to the shareholders of the Company on or about March 18, 2019. This Proxy Statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote. Please read this information carefully. 
Important notice regarding the availability of proxy materials for the Annual Meeting to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019: This proxy statement, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available at www.farmersbankgroup.com.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
When and Where will the Annual Meeting be Held? 
The Annual Meeting will be held Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time at the Company's headquarters, 20 South Broad Street, Canfield, Ohio 44406 and via the Internet at www.meetingcenter.io/257959543 where you will be able to vote electronically and submit questions during the meeting. To obtain directions to attend the Annual Meeting, please contact Shareholder Relations at (330) 533-5127. 
Why did I Receive these Proxy Materials? 
You have received these proxy materials because the Board of Directors is soliciting a proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement contains information that Farmers is required to provide to you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and is intended to assist you in voting your shares. 
Who may Vote at the Annual Meeting? 
The Board of Directors has set March 4, 2019 as the "record date" for the Annual Meeting. This means that only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof. At the close of business on March 4, 2019, 27,790,602 Common Shares were issued and outstanding. Each Common Share entitles the holder to one vote on each item to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting and there is no cumulative voting. 
What is the Difference between Holding Shares as a "Shareholder of Record" and as a "Beneficial Owner"? 
If your Farmers' shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the "shareholder of record" of those shares. Farmers has sent these proxy materials directly to all "shareholders of record." Alternatively, if your Farmers' shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, which is sometimes called "street name," then you are the "beneficial owner" of those shares, and these proxy materials were forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your shares is the shareholder of record for purposes of voting the shares at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization how to vote the Common Shares held in your account by following the voting instructions the organization provides to you. 
How do I Vote? 
Shareholders of record may vote on matters that are properly presented at the Annual Meeting in four ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By completing the accompanying proxy and returning it in the envelope provided;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By submitting your vote telephonically;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By submitting your vote electronically via the Internet before the meeting at www.envisionreports.com/FMNB;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By submitting your vote electronically via the Internet during the meeting at www.meetingcenter.io/257959543; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By attending the Annual Meeting and casting your vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
 For the Annual Meeting, Farmers is offering shareholders of record the opportunity to vote their Common Shares electronically through the Internet or by telephone by following the procedures described on the enclosed proxy instead of submitting the enclosed proxy by mail. In order to vote via the Internet or by telephone, please have the enclosed proxy in hand, and go to the website listed on the proxy or call the number and follow the instructions. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identities, to allow shareholders to give their voting instructions, and to confirm that shareholder instructions have been recorded properly. Shareholders voting through the Internet should understand that they may bear certain costs associated with Internet access, such as usage charges from their Internet service providers. 
If you hold your Common Shares in street name, you should follow the voting instructions provided to you by the organization that holds your Common Shares. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, ballots will be available. If your Common Shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other shareholder of record, you must bring a legal proxy from the shareholder of record indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on March 4, 2019 in order to vote in person. 
How will My Shares be Voted? 
If you vote by mail, through the Internet, by telephone or in person, your Common Shares will be voted as you direct. If you submit a valid proxy prior to the Annual Meeting, but do not complete the voting instructions, your Common Shares will be voted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the one Class III director nominee listed under "Proposal One — Election of Directors;"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the proposal to amend Article XI of the Company's Amended Code of Regulations ("Regulations") under "Proposal Two  — Adoption and Approval of Amendment to Article XI of the Amended Code of Regulations;"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the non-binding advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's named  executive officers under "Proposal Three — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation;"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP as Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm for the year  ending December 31, 2019 under "Proposal Four — Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm;" and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the adjournment of the Annual Meeting, if necessary, in order to solicit additional proxies in the event there are  insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to adopt Proposal Two to amend the Regulations, under "Proposal Five — Adjournment of Annual Meeting."  
[END TABLE]
Can Other Matters be Decided at the Annual Meeting? 
On the date that this proxy statement was printed, Farmers was not aware of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those included in this proxy statement. If you submit a valid proxy and other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, then the individuals appointed as proxies will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.  May I Revoke or Change My Vote? 
Yes, proxies may be revoked at any time before a vote is taken or the authority granted is otherwise exercised. Revocation may be accomplished by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• executing a later dated proxy with regard to the same Common Shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• executing a later casted Internet or telephone vote with regard to the same Common Shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving notice in writing to the Secretary at 20 South Broad Street, Canfield, Ohio 44406; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notifying the Secretary in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your Common Shares are held in street name and you wish to revoke your proxy, you should follow the instructions provided to you by the record holder of your shares. If you wish to revoke your proxy in person at the Annual Meeting, you must bring a legal proxy from the shareholder of record indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the Common Shares on March 4, 2019. Attending the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy. 
Who Pays the Cost of Proxy Solicitation? 
The accompanying proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the Board of Directors, whose notice of meeting is attached to this proxy statement, and the entire cost of such solicitation will be borne by Farmers. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile and electronic mail by directors, officers and employees of Farmers. Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Common Shares held of record by such persons, and Farmers will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith. 
How Many Common Shares Must be Represented at the Annual Meeting in Order to Constitute a Quorum? 
The shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting representing not less than one-third of Farmers' outstanding Common Shares shall constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Consequently, at least 9,263,534 Common Shares must be represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Street name holders generally cannot vote their Common Shares directly and must instead instruct the broker, bank or other shareholder of record how to vote their Common Shares using the voting instructions provided by it. If a street name holder does not provide timely instructions, the broker or other nominee may have the authority to vote on some proposals but not others. If a broker or other nominee votes on one proposal, but does not vote on another proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner, this results in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes on a matter are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum for the meeting, but are not considered entitled to vote on that particular matter.  What are the Voting Requirements to Elect the Directors and to Approve the Other Proposals Discussed in this Proxy Statement? 
The vote required to approve each of the proposals that are scheduled to be presented at the Annual Meeting is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal     Vote Required 
    Proposal One  Election of Directors          Election of the one Class III director nominee requires the affirmative vote of the holders of  a plurality of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes and proxies marked WITHHOLD AUTHORITY will not be counted toward the  election of the director or toward the election an individual nominee and, thus, will have no effect other than that they will be counted for establishing a quorum. 
• Proposal Two — Approval of Amendment to Article XI of the Amended Code of Regulations• The proposal to amend Article XI of the Regulations requires the affirmative vote of the holders of  common shares entitled to exercise at least a majority of the voting power of Farmers. Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on Proposal Two. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal Two and thus will have the same effect as votes against Proposal Two. 
    Proposal Three  Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation            The proposal to approve the resolution regarding the compensation of Farmers named executive  officers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shareholders may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN  from voting on Proposal Three. Broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining whether Proposal Three has been approved. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for  purposes of Proposal Three and thus will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Three. As this is an advisory vote, the outcome of the vote is not binding on the  Compensation 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
           Committee or the Board of Directors with respect to future executive compensation decisions,  including those relating to Farmers' named executive officers or otherwise. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation  decisions. 
• Proposal Four — Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting  Firm• The proposal to ratify the appointment of Farmers' independent registered public accounting  firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or  "ABSTAIN" from voting on Proposal Four. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal Four and thus will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Four. 
• Proposal Five — Approval of Adjournment of the Annual Meeting• The proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a  majority of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present. Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on  Proposal Five. Broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining whether Proposal Five has been approved. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal  Five and thus will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Five. 
[END TABLE]
Under Ohio law, the Articles, and Farmers' Regulations, the nominees for election as directors who receive the greatest number of votes cast will be elected directors. Each shareholder will be entitled to cast one vote for each common share owned, and shareholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. Common shares as to which the authority to vote is withheld are not counted toward the election of directors. However, the Board of Directors has adopted a "Majority Vote Withheld Policy" in the event that "Withhold Authority" has been indicated by a majority of the votes cast with respect to any director in an uncontested election. A summary of this policy is set forth under the caption "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE — Policies of the Board of Directors" beginning on page 11 of this proxy statement.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors — Independence 
The Board of Directors is currently comprised of 10 members, one of whom is a nominee for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Additional information regarding the director nominee is set forth in "Proposal One — Election of Directors" beginning on page 16 of this proxy statement. In 2018, the Board of Directors affirmatively determined that each of the directors listed below is an "independent director" under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Gregory C. Bestic    Lance J. Ciroli 
 Anne Frederick Crawford    Ralph D. Macali 
 Terry A. Moore    Edward W. Muransky 
 David Z. Paull    James R. Smail 
 Gregg Strollo     
[END TABLE]
The only director (or director nominee) of Farmers who has been determined by the Board of Directors not to be independent is Kevin J. Helmick, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. 
During 2018, certain current directors and executive officers of Farmers, and their associates, were customers of, and had banking transactions with, various subsidiaries of the Company, including Farmers' subsidiary bank, The Farmers National Bank of Canfield ("Farmers Bank"). All relationships between any director or executive officer and Farmers or any of its subsidiaries were conducted in the ordinary course of business. Farmers encourages its directors and executive officers to maintain these relationships and expects that these transactions will continue in the future. All loans and loan commitments included in such transactions were made and will be made: (i) in the ordinary course of business; (ii) on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Farmers; and (iii) without more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. After reviewing the details of these relationships, the Board of Directors has determined that such relationships do not interfere with the exercise of any director's independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. 
In assessing the independence of directors, the Board of Directors also considers the business relationships between Farmers and its directors or their affiliated businesses other than ordinary banking relationships, if any. Where such business relationships other than ordinary banking relationships exist, the Board of Directors evaluates the scope and nature of each business relationship. There were no such business relationships between Farmers and its directors or the directors' affiliated companies that were so considered by the Board of Directors in 2018. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Farmers' Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving, pursuant to the Company's written policy, all related party transactions that are material to the Company's consolidated financial statements or otherwise require disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Extensions of credit by Farmers or any of its subsidiaries to "insiders" of the Company or its subsidiaries are also regulated by Regulation O adopted under the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. It is Farmers'   policy that any transactions with persons whom Regulation O defines as "insiders" (i.e., executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests) are engaged in the same manner as transactions conducted with all members of the public. Transactions are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors either on a case-by-case basis (such as loans made by Farmers Bank to an insider) or, in the case of an ongoing relationship, at the outset of the relationship with periodic review. All loans outstanding to insiders of Farmers at any time since January 1, 2018: (i) were made in the ordinary course of business; (ii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company; and (iii) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
Attendance at Meetings 
The Board of Directors held 11 meetings during 2018. All incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the total of all meetings of the Board of Directors and any committees thereof on which such director served during the year, except Mr. Scott who retired on July 17, 2018. In accordance with Farmers' Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Corporate Governance Guidelines"), directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board of Directors, although it is understood that, on occasion, a director may not be able to attend a meeting. Directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting. All of the current members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting held on April 19, 2018. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors has appointed Lance J. Ciroli as its non-executive Chairman. As Chairman, Mr. Ciroli presides over meetings of the Board of Directors, consults and advises the Board and its committees on the business and affairs of Farmers, and performs other responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board from time to time. The Board of Directors has also appointed James R. Smail as its non-executive Vice Chairman. As Vice Chairman, Mr. Smail presides over meetings of the Board of Directors in the absence of Mr. Ciroli, and also consults and advises the Board and its committees on the business and affairs of Farmers, and performs other responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board from time to time. Kevin J. Helmick, as President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible both for overseeing Farmers' day-to-day operations and for establishing and leading the execution of the Company's long-term strategic objectives, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board of Directors and its committees. Farmers does not have a formal policy with respect to separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, as the Board of Directors believes that flexibility in appointing the Chairman of the Board allows the Board of Directors to make a determination as to such position from time to time and in a manner that it believes is in the best interest of Farmers and its shareholders. The Board of Directors believes that the current structure best serves Farmers because it allows Mr. Helmick to focus on managing the Company's day-to-day business while allowing Mr. Ciroli to lead the Board of Directors in its primary role of review and oversight of management. The Board of Directors also believes that its leadership structure has created an environment of open, efficient communication between the Board and management, enabling the Board to maintain an active, informed role in risk management by being able to monitor and manage those matters that may present significant risks to Farmers. 
The role of the Board of Directors in Farmers' risk management process includes reviewing regular reports from senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risks. The Board of Directors reviews these reports to enable it to understand and assess Farmers' risk assessment, risk   management and risk mitigation strategies. While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of both management and the Board also have responsibility for risk management. In accordance with the Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee Charter, the Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of management's implementation and enforcement of Farmers' policies, procedures and practices relating to: (i) the management of enterprise-wide risk; (ii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital and reserve levels; and (iii) the Company's long-term strategic plans and initiatives. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing and monitoring management's conduct of Farmers' financial reporting process and system of internal accounting and financial controls. Finally, the Compensation Committee oversees the management of risks relating to executive and non-executive compensation plans and arrangements. While each committee oversees certain risks and the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed of such risks through committee reports. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors conducts its business through meetings of the Board and the following committees: (i) Audit Committee; (ii) Compensation Committee; (iii) Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; (iv) Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee; and (v) Executive Committee. Each committee other than the Executive Committee meets on a regular basis and each committee reports their deliberations and actions to the full Board of Directors. Each of the committees has the authority to engage outside experts, advisors and counsel to the extent it considers appropriate to assist the committee in its work. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee the accounting and financial reporting process of the Company. The Audit Committee also reviews, evaluates and approves all related party transactions. The Audit Committee members currently are Gregory C. Bestic (Chairman), Ralph D.

In addition, the Compensation Committee may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer, or another executive designee, the authority to approve salary and other compensation for employees below the executive officer level in accordance with overall pools, policy guidelines and limits approved by the Committee. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select, retain, terminate and approve the fees and other retention terms of special counsel or other experts or consultants, as it deems appropriate, without seeking approval of the Board or management. Additional information regarding the Compensation Committee's role is set forth in the "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" section of this proxy statement, beginning on page 25. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's purpose is to: (i) identify and recommend individuals to the Board of Directors for nomination as members of the Board and its committees; (ii) promote effective corporate governance, including developing and recommending to the Board of Directors a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the Company; and (iii) lead the Board of Directors in its annual review of the Board's performance and the performance of each of its committees. The members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee currently are Terry A. Moore (Chair), Gregory C. Bestic, Anne Frederick Crawford, Ralph D. Macali, and Edward W. Muransky, each of whom also served on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee during 2018.

The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Corporate Governance Guidelines, both of which are reviewed annually by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors to reflect current Commission and NASDAQ rules, requirements and best corporate practices. Copies of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Charter and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Farmers' website at www.farmersbankgroup.com. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee held five meetings during 2018. 
Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
The Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee oversees management's implementation and enforcement of the Company's policies, procedures and practices   relating to the management of enterprise-wide risk.

Additional information regarding the Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee's role is set forth in the "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" section of this proxy statement, beginning on page 25. 
Executive Committee 
The Executive Committee is authorized to act on behalf of the Board of Directors on all corporate actions for which applicable law does not require participation by the full Board. All actions taken by the Executive Committee must be reported at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. The members of the Executive Committee are James R. Smail (Chair), Lance J. Ciroli, Kevin J. Helmick, and Terry A. Moore, all of whom also served on the Executive Committee during 2018. The Executive Committee operates under a written charter, which is reviewed annually by the Committee and the Board of Directors. A copy of the current Executive Committee Charter is available on Farmers' website at www.farmersbankgroup.com. The Executive Committee held eleven meetings in 2018. 
Policies of the Board of Directors 
Majority Withheld Vote 
The Board of Directors recognizes that, pursuant to Section 1701.55(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, director nominees who receive the greatest number of shareholder votes are automatically elected to the Board of Directors, regardless of whether the votes in favor of such nominees constitute a majority of the voting power of Farmers, because our Articles do not include alternative election standards. Nevertheless, the Board of Directors has adopted a policy that, in an uncontested election, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election (a "Majority Withheld Vote"), should promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject it. In considering whether to recommend to the Board of Directors to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider all information and factors deemed relevant, including, without limitation: (i) the reasons (if any) given by shareholders as to why they withheld their votes, and (ii) the qualifications and performance of the tendering director(s) and his or her contributions to the Board of Directors and Farmers. The Board of Directors will act on any tendered resignation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Following the Board of Directors' determination, Farmers will promptly disclose the Board's decision whether to accept or reject the director's resignation offer (and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer) in a press release and in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's consideration or action by the Board of Directors regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. If a majority of the Board of Directors receives a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then the independent directors who   did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote will consider the resignation offers and whether to accept or reject them. 
Director Nominations 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider candidates for director, including those recommended by a shareholder who submits the person's name and qualifications in writing. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has no specific minimum qualifications for a recommended candidate, and does not consider shareholder recommended candidates differently from other candidates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the fit of an individual's skills with those of other directors and potential directors in building a Board that is effective and responsive to the needs of the Company and its shareholders. The following attributes are considered important to such consideration, but all may not necessarily be possessed by any one director candidate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business community, including high personal and professional values, ethics and  integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• current knowledge and contacts in the communities in which Farmers does business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability and willingness to commit adequate time to diligently attend to Board of Director and committee matters;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to think and act independently yet constructively in a mutually respectful environment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and other demographics; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of the nominee to satisfy the independence requirements of NASDAQ.  
[END TABLE]
While the Board of Directors does not have a formal diversity policy, diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and other demographics is one criterion on which the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee bases its evaluation of potential candidates for director positions. When identifying first-time candidates or nominees for director, or in evaluating individuals recommended by shareholders, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider diversity, the current composition of the Board in light of the diverse communities and geographies we serve, and the interplay of the candidate's or nominee's experience, education, skills, background, gender, race, ethnicity and other qualities and attributes with those of the other Board members. The inclusion of diversity in the listed criteria reflects the Board of Director's belief that diversity is an important component of an effective Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates each potential director candidate on their specific skills, expertise and background, as well as traditional diversity concepts. 
In addition to recommendations presented by shareholders, the Board of Directors maintains a current list of potential director candidates that fit the characteristics and qualifications of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which it uses from time to time to fill director vacancies or for director nominations. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee makes its recommendation regarding nominations to the Board of Directors, and nominees are selected by the Board of Directors. 
Under the Regulations, a shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors who intends to nominate a director for election must deliver written notice to the Secretary of   Farmers no later than 90 days and no earlier than 120 days in advance of such meeting; provided, however, that if less than 90 days' notice or prior disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, written notice to the Secretary of the Company must be delivered or mailed not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given or made to shareholders. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy that annual meetings of shareholders will be held on the third Thursday of April of each year unless and until publicly announced otherwise, consistent with our general past practice and the Regulations. Accordingly, for purposes of our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders intended to be held on April 16, 2020, a nomination of a director for election must be received by Farmers' Secretary no earlier than December 18, 2019 and not later than January 17, 2020. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines also formalize certain aspects of Farmers' shareholder nomination process. Pursuant to the Regulations and/or the Corporate Governance Guidelines, each shareholder notice must include the following information regarding a director candidate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  the name, age, business address and residence address of the candidate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

  h.  the information required by Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K (relating to the nature and existence of certain legal  proceedings involving Farmers and the nominating shareholder) and whether the shareholder has been or is currently subject to any enforcement action or penalty or, to the shareholder's knowledge, is currently under any investigation that could  lead to such an enforcement action or penalty or criminal action;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  i.  whether the shareholder is acting on behalf of, or at the request of, any other shareholder; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  j.  if the shareholder is other than an individual (i) the names of the shareholder's five most senior executive officers (or persons performing  similar roles), (ii) the names and addresses of each person that has a 10% or more voting, ownership or economic interest in the shareholder and the respective amounts of such interests, (iii) the names and addresses of each person that would  be deemed to control the shareholder and (iv) the name and address of any advisor to the shareholder that has the principal responsibility for its investment or voting decisions.  
[END TABLE]
In the case of any investment fund or similar organization that is a nominating shareholder, these shareholder disclosure obligations shall also apply to the principal advisor to the fund. Also, if the shareholder is other than an individual, these disclosure requirements apply to the shareholder's principal shareholders, executive officers and other controlling parties. 
During the course of any candidate's consideration, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may request additional information through written director questionnaires and further communications to assess whether the candidate satisfies, in the view of the committee, requirements of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Director Code of Ethics, and other policies applicable to members of the Board and its committees. 
If a nominating shareholder or director candidate believes that information supplied in response to any of the above inquiries is confidential, the shareholder or nominee may request confidential treatment for such information. In such event, the information shall be maintained on a confidential basis unless the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is advised by counsel that disclosure is appropriate in connection with the solicitation of proxies relating to the director candidate. 
In the event that it is subsequently determined that any of the information provided by the candidate or nominating shareholder is materially inaccurate, a director candidate who   provided the materially inaccurate information or whose nominating shareholder provided the materially inaccurate information shall be required to resign from the Board of Directors, and, in the event of a refusal to resign, such a determination shall constitute grounds for removal from the Board, unless it is determined by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee that the inaccuracy was inadvertent. 
Shareholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
Proposals by shareholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received by the Secretary of Farmers no later than November 19, 2019, to be eligible for inclusion in Farmers' proxy, notice of meeting, and proxy statement relating to its 2020 Annual Meeting. Farmers will not be required to include in its proxy, notice of meeting, or proxy statement, a shareholder proposal that is received after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for shareholder proposals established by the applicable Commission rules. 
If a shareholder intends to submit a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that is not eligible for inclusion in the proxy materials relating to the meeting, and the shareholder fails to give the Company notice in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), by February 2, 2020, then the proxy holders will be allowed to use their discretionary authority with respect to such proposal if the proposal is properly raised at the Annual Meeting in 2020. The submission of such a notice does not ensure that a proposal can be raised at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
In each case written notice must be given to Farmers, addressed to its Corporate Secretary, at the following address: 20 South Broad Street, Canfield, Ohio 44406. 
Shareholder Communications with Directors 
All written communications addressed to an individual director at Farmers' address or to one of the offices of a subsidiary of the Company, except those clearly of a marketing nature, will be forwarded directly to the director. All written communications addressed to the Board of Directors at Farmers' address or to one of the offices of a subsidiary of the Company will be presented to the full Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board of Directors. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Farmers' directors, officers and persons who own beneficially more than 10% of its Common Shares ("Section 16 Filers") to file reports of ownership and transactions in the Common Shares with the Commission and to furnish the Company with copies of all such forms filed. Based solely on the review of copies of reports furnished to us or written representations that no reports were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met in the last fiscal year by our Section 16 Filers.  PROPOSAL ONE — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
In accordance with the provisions of Farmers' Regulations, the Board of Directors has currently fixed the number of directors at 9. The Board of Directors is currently divided into three classes, each with three-year terms, and there are currently four directors serving in Class I, four directors serving in Class II, and two directors serving in Class III. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors the re-nomination of one of the Class III directors. Set forth below for the nominee for election and for each director whose term will continue after the Annual Meeting is a brief statement, including age, principal occupation and business experience during the past five years. In addition, the following information provides the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's evaluation regarding the nomination of the director nominee and the key attributes, skills, and qualifications presented by the director nominee and the continuing directors. The following information, as of March 4, 2019, with respect to the age, principal occupation or employment, other affiliations and business experience during at least the last five years of each director and director nominee, has been furnished to Farmers by each director nominee and director. Except where indicated, no corporation is a parent, subsidiary, or other affiliate of Farmers. 
Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this proxy statement. If any nominee should become unavailable to serve for any reason, it is intended that votes will be cast for a substitute nominee designated by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has no reason to believe that any nominee named will be unable to serve if elected.

 PROPOSAL TWO — ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO  ARTICLE XI OF THE CODE OF REGULATIONS 
General 
On February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions declaring it advisable and in the best interests of Farmers and its shareholders to amend Article XI of the Company's Regulations in order to provide the Board with the non-exclusive authority to amend the Regulations as permitted by, and the Board is now unanimously proposing and recommending that our shareholders adopt and approve the proposed amendment to Article XI. 
Description of the Amendment 
Section 1701.11(A)(1)(d) of the Ohio Revised Code was amended in 2006 to grant directors the authority to amend regulations of Ohio corporations if and to the extent that the regulations so provide or permit, unless another provision of the Ohio Revised Code expressly reserves such authority to shareholders, and provided that no provision or permission in the articles or regulations may divest shareholders of the power or limit shareholders' power to adopt, amend, or repeal the regulations. This limited authority of directors to amend regulations was adopted to help align Ohio's corporate laws with practices common in other states. Based on this provision, shareholders of an Ohio corporation may grant directors the authority to amend their corporation's regulations subject, however, to the foregoing certain restrictions. With such authority, directors may amend provisions in regulations relating to important but primarily administrative or procedural issues, such as allowing the use of electronic proxies, fixing the date and location of meetings, or requirements relating to notice of nominations or shareholder proposals. However, directors may not amend regulations in a manner that restrict shareholders' authority to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations, or amend any provisions of regulations that address the following matters which are reserved to shareholders: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Specify the minimum percentage of shares required to call a shareholders' meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establish the length of the time period required for notice of a shareholders' meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide voting rights with respect to shares not yet fully paid;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establish quorum requirements for shareholder or director meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Specify the vote required for an action of the directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prohibit taking shareholder or director actions without a meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Define director terms of office or classification of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establish greater than a majority vote of shareholders to remove directors without cause;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delegate authority to board committees to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Eliminate the requirement that a control share acquisition of an issuing public corporation be approved by the acquired corporation's shareholders   
[END TABLE]
The proposed amendment of Farmers' Regulations to give our Board of Directors the limited authority to amend the Regulations is not part of a plan by the Company to adopt other measures having potential anti-takeover effects. However, the Articles and Regulations   of the Company currently include the following provisions which may be considered to have anti-takeover effects: (a) the classification of the Board of Directors into three classes, with one class of directors being elected each year; (b) the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors; (c) the requirement that shareholder nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors be made in writing and delivered or mailed to the secretary of the Company within specified timeframes; (d) the requirement that directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitling them to exercise not less than two-thirds of the voting power of the Company at an election of directors; (e) the requirements that certain business combinations be approved by at least 80 percent of the voting power of the Company, depending on the nature of the recommendation of the Board of Directors with regard to the relevant acquisition; and (f) the lack of a provision opting out of application of the Ohio Merger Moratorium statute and its restrictions on persons who become the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the shares of the Company. 
Based on its determination that giving our Board of Directors the non-exclusive authority to amend our Regulations as permitted under Ohio law is in the best interests of our shareholders, the Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" adoption of Proposal Two. 
Proposed Amendment 
If this Proposal Two is approved by shareholders, new Article XI would read in its entirety as follows: 
ARTICLE XI: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  By the Shareholders. These Regulations may be amended or repealed at any meeting of shareholders called for that purpose, by the affirmative vote  of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power on such proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  By the Directors. These Regulations may be amended or repealed at any meeting of the Board of Directors called for that purpose at which a quorum  is present, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members in attendance, or by the unanimous written consent of the Board of Directors, provided that such regulations as amended or repealed will not divest the shareholders of the power, nor  limit their power to adopt, amend, or repeal these Regulations.  
[END TABLE]
Vote Required and Board of Directors' Recommendation 
This proposal to amend Article XI requires the affirmative vote of the holders of Common Shares entitled to exercise at least a majority of the voting power of Farmers. Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on Proposal Two. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against Proposal Two. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION AND APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL TWO AND THE AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE XI TO PROVIDE THE BOARD WITH THE 
NON-EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE REGULATIONS.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Introduction 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information regarding the compensation programs for Farmers' named executive officers, including: (i) the overall objectives of the Company's compensation program and what it is designed to reward; (ii) each element of compensation that is provided; and (iii) an explanation of the Compensation Committee's decisions regarding Farmers' named executive officers. For purposes of this discussion, references to "we," "our" and "us" refer to Farmers. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is comprised of the following segments: Executive Summary, Compensation Philosophy and Objectives, 2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation, and Other Elements of our Compensation Programs. For 2018, our named executive officers were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Kevin J. Helmick    President and Chief Executive Officer 
 Carl D. Culp    Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary

 Mark L. Graham    Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer 
 Mark J. Wenick    Executive Vice President, Chief Wealth Management Officer 
[END TABLE]
Executive Summary 
We continued to deliver strong financial performance during 2018 which we believe compared well to our peers in the financial institution industry. We also believe that the compensation of our executive team reflected their continued successful efforts and aligned well with our financial performance. 
Financial Performance and Significant Events affecting Executive Compensation in 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our net income in 2018 was $32.6 million, or $1.16 per diluted share, compared to $22.7 million, or $.82 per diluted share, for 2017. Excluding a net  deferred tax asset adjustment, net income for 2017 would have been $24.5 million, or $0.88 per diluted share. This financial metric was one of the three objective elements of our 2018 annual cash incentive plan (the "Annual Incentive  Plan"). The target level of this metric was $1.10 and the maximum was $1.16, so our strong performance resulted in payouts to our named executive officers at the maximum level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annualized return on average assets for 2018 was 1.46%, compared to 1.09% for 2017. This financial metric was the third objective element of our Annual  Incentive Plan, with a target of 1.33% and a maximum of 1.40%, so our performance on this metric also resulted in payouts at the maximum level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our efficiency ratio for 2018 improved to 57.73% compared to 59.13% for 2017. This financial metric also was an objective element of our Annual Incentive Plan,  with a target level of 59.50% and a maximum of 58.00%, so our improved performance also resulted in payouts on this metric at the maximum level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Linkages between our financial performance and the resulting payouts for our named executive officers under our annual and long-term incentive programs are

     described more fully under the caption "2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation" beginning on page 30 in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.   
[END TABLE]
Portions of the foregoing and certain following financial presentations in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis include the use of both GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and non-GAAP financial measures. We use these financial measures to monitor and evaluate our on-going performance and allocate resources, and we believe that these additional non-GAAP measures are useful to investors for financial analyses of Farmers. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on Appendix A to this proxy statement. 
Significant Compensation Developments in 2018 
Each year we evaluate all of our compensation programs, policies and payouts to determine whether our compensation structure continues to align with our pay-for-performance focus and promote long-term shareholder value. Based on this evaluation, we determined in 2018 to maintain the general structure of our compensation programs, as summarized below: 
Annual Incentive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We continued the structure of the Annual Incentive Plan for our executive officers with three primary objective  corporate level metrics: (i) earnings per share with a weighting of 30%, (ii) annualized return on average assets with a weighting of 30%, and (iii) corporate efficiency ratio with a weighting of 20%. We also retained a subjective factor  for each named executive officer other than Mr. Graham with 20% weighting for Messrs. Helmick, Culp and Witmer, and 15% weighting for Mr. Wenick. The subjective factor is evaluated based on a scorecard assessment for each individual's  performance. Messrs. Graham and Wenick had additional objective metrics based on their areas of responsibility. All elements and results of our 2018 Annual Incentive Plan for our named executive officers is more fully described under "2018  Named Executive Officers Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan" beginning on page 30. The following is a tabular summary of our objective 2018 Annual Incentive Plan results:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Metrics    Target     Actual     Payout%   
 Earnings Per Share    $ 1.10     $ 1.16       150%  
 Return on Average Assets      1.33%      1.46%      150%  
 Efficiency Ratio      59.50%      57.73%      150%  
[END TABLE]
Long-term Incentive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During 2018 we granted equity-based long-term incentive compensation awards under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan to help achieve our recruiting, retention and  long-term performance goals. We continued to allocate our total long-term compensation opportunity as follows: 25% in service-based equity awards subject to three-year cliff vesting, and 75% in performance-based awards; 50% of all long-term  incentive awards were equity-based awards subject to vesting determined by our average return on equity ("ROE") compared to ROE performance of our peer group of banking companies over a three-year period, and 25% of all long-term incentive  awards were cash-based awards subject to vesting determined by our total  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     shareholder return ("TSR") compared to peer group performance over a three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our performance for the long-term incentive compensation awards we issued in 2016 for the three-year performance period that ended on December 31, 2018  resulted in the following percentage payouts, as described more fully under "2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation – Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans" beginning on page 33:  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 2016-2018 Vesting Summary

 Relative  TSR(1)      25%      50 th       72.10        188.40%  
 Relative Average  ROE(2)      50%      50 th       88.30        100.00%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Cash-based award with performance and vesting determined as a percentile compared to the total shareholder return of peer group companies for the three-year  period ending December 31, 2018. Percentage payout opportunity ranged from 20% at the threshold 25th percentile of the peer group, 50% for performing at the 50th percentile, and 200% vesting for performing at or above the 75th percentile.  
  (2)  Equity-based award with performance and vesting determined as a percentile compared to the average annual return on equity of peer group companies for the  three-year period ending December 31, 2018, excluding a net deferred tax asset adjustment for 2017. These equity-based awards were granted at the maximum payout level of 200% of target opportunity, so the percentage payout opportunities ranged  from 10% vesting for performing at the threshold 25th percentile of the peer  group, 25% for performing at the 50th percentile, and 100% for performing at  or above the 75th percentile.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee's Philosophy on Executive Compensation 
Our goal is to hire and retain an executive management team that we believe will create both short-term and long-term institutional success. We seek to achieve this goal by providing a fair, competitive compensation package that includes performance-based, at-risk pay components that align with the Company's strategic and financial performance objectives, in order to drive successful annual and long-term performance that ultimately aligns with long-term shareholder value. We also seek to implement compensation programs that appropriately balance risk and financial results so that our compensation programs maintain and promote our overall safety and soundness. 
The principal elements of each named executive officers' compensation currently consist of three core elements: base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation. Like other employees, the named executive officers also receive matching contributions to their 401(k) retirement plan accounts. 
The Role of the Compensation Committee in Determining Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of our named executive officers and establishes our executive compensation philosophy, policy, elements and strategy and reviews proposed executive compensation plans and arrangements, including   employment and severance arrangements with our executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of our executive officers in order to determine appropriate compensation adjustments as well as future compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee also reviews overall corporate policy regarding compensation and benefit programs that are generally available to all employees and may make recommendations concerning those programs. 
Although the Compensation Committee has authority to approve individual compensation arrangements, for example employment contracts and individual incentive award goals, as well as authority to engage legal advisors and compensation consultants for advice on compensation issues, the Compensation Committee does not act entirely autonomously in considering and implementation of our compensation plans. For example, the Compensation Committee recommends the terms of plans such as our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to final approval of the full independent Board of Directors. At the Compensation Committee's request, management may provide financial, tax, accounting, or operational information relevant to Compensation Committee deliberations. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
As permitted by the Compensation Committee Charter, the Compensation Committee has engaged Pay Governance, LLC ("Pay Governance") as its outside independent compensation consultant since 2011. Pursuant to the terms of its engagement by the Compensation Committee, Pay Governance generally reviews, analyzes and provides advice regarding our executive compensation and director compensation programs in relation to the objectives of those programs, including comparisons to designated peer group companies and to "best practices," and also provides information and advice on competitive compensation practices and trends, along with specific views on our compensation programs. In its role as our independent compensation consultant, representatives of Pay Governance engaged in discussions with the Compensation Committee and responded on a regular basis to questions from the Committee and the Committee's other advisors, providing them with its opinions with respect to the design and implementation of current or proposed compensation programs. During fiscal 2018, Pay Governance reported directly to the Compensation Committee and the Committee retains the sole authority to retain or terminate Pay Governance. Pay Governance did not provide additional services to the company or its affiliates in an amount in excess of $120,000 during 2018. 
Compensation Consultant Independence 
The Compensation Committee has the responsibility to consider certain independence factors before selecting compensation consultants and other compensation advisers. In connection with the foregoing, the Compensation Committee reviewed, considered and discussed the relevant factors established by NASDAQ to determine such independence, both through surveying Pay Governance and by soliciting input from members of the Compensation Committee through our annual director and officer questionnaires. Based on its review, consideration and discussion, the Compensation Committee determined that the work performed and to be performed by Pay Governance as the Committee's compensation consultant has not raised and does not raise any conflict of interest, and also determined that Pay Governance qualifies as independent for purposes of the Exchange Act and revised NASDAQ Corporate Governance Requirements.  Say-on-Pay Consideration 
At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved on an advisory basis the executive compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for that Annual Meeting, with over 88% of the Common Shares represented by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the 2018 Annual Meeting voting "for" such approval. The Compensation Committee evaluated the results of this supportive advisory vote, together with the other factors and data discussed in this Compensation and Discussion Analysis, in determining Farmers' executive compensation policies, making executive compensation decisions, and continuing implementation of the Committee's compensation philosophy and objectives. 
Peer Group Evaluation and Executive Compensation Benchmarks 
The Compensation Committee has generally evaluated compensation practices at similarly situated financial institutions to help determine the levels of compensation for financial services executives in our geographic market. In addition, the Compensation Committee does not have a practice of adhering to a strict formula in order to determine executive officer compensation packages rather has relied on a variety of factors including experience, responsibility, individual performance and our overall financial performance. However, given the competitive nature of the financial services industry in general, and the fact that we compete in a primary market with regional and national banking organizations that are significantly larger and that can provide more attractive compensation packages to top executive talent, the Compensation Committee recognizes the need to provide competitive overall compensation opportunities to retain our high-performing executives and attract new executive talent. 
During 2015, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Pay Governance, undertook an extensive re-evaluation of our peer group and assessed the need to change the composition of Farmers' peer group to reflect a significant increase in the size of Farmers due to two acquisitions, to better reflect similarly situated financial institutions for purposes of determining competitive market positioning for executive compensation determinations. The Compensation Committee used several factors to identify, evaluate and select peer financial institutions including, but not limited to, (i) factors of size (e.g., assets (ranging from approximately $1 billion to $4 billion), revenues, employees and market capitalization), (ii) factors of profitability and growth (e.g., net revenue and operating income), and (iii) geographic location. The Compensation Committee continued to utilize the following remaining peer group of 17 companies for calendar year 2018 to evaluate the competitiveness of our pay structures and levels, taking into account acquisitions of previously included institutions (the "2018 Peer Group"):

 2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation 
Base Salary 
Base salaries are intended to reward the named executive officers based upon their roles with us and for their performance in those roles. For each named executive officer, their base salaries are reviewed annually subject to adjustments based upon our financial performance, the individual performance of the particular executive, and our overall compensation philosophy of providing base compensation levels for our executive officers within 10% of the median of our 2018 Peer Group. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of Mr. Helmick in light of specified goals and objectives with input from each independent director. Based on such evaluation and input, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation of Mr. Helmick and discusses its determination with all independent directors. All other executive officers are evaluated on a variety of factors including leadership performance, strategic planning and execution, communication abilities, business knowledge, and awareness and accountability. Based thereon, Mr. Helmick determines whether a base salary increase or decrease is considered to be merited based upon individual performance and presents his base salary adjustment recommendations to the Compensation Committee. For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to increase Mr. Helmick's base salary from $430,000 to $445,000, an increase of 3.5%, effective April 1, 2018. As a result of the evaluations and recommendations by Mr. Helmick, the following merit-based base salary adjustments were made in 2018 for the remaining named executive officers effective April 1, 2018: (i) Mr. Culp received a base salary increase of approximately 16% to $240,005, based on a peer group based market adjustment and annual evaluation; (ii) Mr. Witmer received a base salary increase of approximately 3% to $275,000; (iv) Mr. Graham received a base salary increase of approximately 3% to $182,228; and (v) Mr. Wenick received a base salary increase of approximately 9% to $249,990. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
The Compensation Committee believes that performance-based annual cash incentives are an effective way to compensate executives for working together as a team to achieve short-term specific financial goals, which the Compensation Committee and management have established as near-term drivers of our long-term success, as well as certain individualized goals specific to an executive's role and duties. The following is a discussion of the annual cash incentive program as it continued to be implemented by the Compensation Committee during 2018. 
The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to foster superior financial results by providing equitable and attainable corporate-wide incentives that reward individual and team efforts to achieve specified performance objectives as determined and applied each fiscal year. The program provides our executive officers and certain non-executive employees the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments based upon achievement of such corporate and individual performance goals. Our full-time and part-time, regular, non-commissioned-based associates and executives, as well as those of our subsidiaries, are generally eligible to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan.  In 2018, the Compensation Committee established the target bonus opportunities under the Annual Incentive Plan for each eligible named executive officer expressed as a percentage of base salary. The following table sets forth such target bonus opportunities for each participating named executive officer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Target Annual Incentive Plan   Opportunity (% of base salary)   
 Kevin J. Helmick      40%  
 Carl D. Culp      35%  
 Mark R. Witmer      35%  
 Mark L. Graham      35%  
 Mark J. Wenick      35%  
[END TABLE]
Payments under the Annual Incentive Plan are contingent primarily on the achievement of pre-established performance goals relating to objective financial metrics established for each participating named executive officer by the Compensation Committee, and secondarily upon the results of a subjective evaluation of each individual executive's performance. Each of the elements has an assigned weight and each of the objective financial criteria has a specific target or goal for the year. In the event that we (or the individual participant) do not meet the specified goal or target for a particular metric, then no compensation will be paid with respect to that objective portion of the Annual Incentive Plan. 
The Compensation Committee established a threshold payout of 50% of target opportunity upon attaining a threshold level of the objective metrics, a target payout of 100% upon attaining 100% of the target level of the objective metrics, and a maximum payout of 150% of target opportunity upon attaining at or greater than a maximum level of the objective metrics. For performance falling within each of the percentile ranges, payouts are made on an interpolated basis. 
In establishing the Annual Incentive Plan's objective metrics and targets for 2018, the Compensation Committee utilized the Company's budgeting model to set the performance at levels that were determined to be achievable with strong management performance. All named executive officers were allocated certain weightings of three core corporate financial measures: earnings per share ("EPS"), return on average assets ("ROA"), and efficiency ratio. Those were the sole objective performance criteria allocated to Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer. The named executive officers other than Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer had significant additional objective metrics based on their specific areas of responsibility and oversight. Finally, in addition to the objective performance metrics, a subjective metric was included for each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Graham, with a weighting of 20% of the total bonus opportunity for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer and a weighting of 15% for Mr. Wenick. The following tables set forth the applicable objective performance metrics, weightings, targets and percentage payouts on such objective metrics for each of the named executive officers under the Annual Incentive Plan in 2018:

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  In addition to these objective metrics, Mr. Wenick's Annual Incentive Plan included an objective metric based on profitability of the Wealth divisions  he manages, which is measured by internal financial information not publicly disclosed.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the objective performance metrics, the Compensation Committee included a subjective metric for each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Graham, weighted at 20% of the total bonus opportunity for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer, and 15% for Mr. Wenick. Payouts under this subjective metric were based on evaluations of overall job performance during 2018 using an extensive performance review scorecard for each executive. For each named executive officer other than Mr. Helmick, the scorecards were completed by Mr. Helmick and he provided the basis of his evaluations to the Compensation Committee for the subjective portion of the executive's bonus for 2018. For Mr. Helmick, each member of the Board of Directors provided input on Mr. Helmick's performance, which was considered by the Compensation Committee in reaching its determination with respect to the subjective element of Mr. Helmick's 2018 annual bonus. Based upon such reviews and recommendations, the Compensation Committee approved the following percentage payouts with respect to the subjective element of the total bonus opportunity: (i) Mr. Helmick, 100% of the possible 20% weighting; (ii) Mr. Culp, 100% of the possible 20% weighting; (iii) Mr. Witmer, 100% of the possible 20% weighting, and (iv) Mr. Wenick, 100% of the possible 15% weighting. 
Finally, the Compensation Committee continued to include a circuit breaker in the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, based on Farmers' "Texas ratio" for the year. The Texas ratio is determined by dividing the amount of Farmers Bank's non-performing loans, other real estate owned, and loans delinquent for more than 90 days, by Farmers Bank's tangible capital equity plus its loan loss reserves. If this ratio exceeds 20% for the year, no bonuses are payable under the Annual Incentive Plan. Farmers' Texas ratio for 2018 was 3.25%, well below this circuit breaker level. The Compensation Committee believes that the use of a circuit breaker in our annual bonus program helps maintain minimum levels of safety and soundness of our institution in the context of providing appropriate near-term incentives for achieving superior financial performance objectives.  As a result of the performance of Farmers with respect to the above-described objective metrics and each named executive officer's individual performance evaluations, the Compensation Committee awarded the following payouts with respect to 2018 performance under the Annual Incentive Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Amount Earned under Annual Incentive Plan  for 2018      Payout as a Percentage of Target Opportunity for 2018

 Mark J. Wenick    $ 115,089        132%  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans 
In 2011, the Board of Directors first approved a long-term cash incentive compensation plan (the "LTI Cash Program") under which our executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive awards for possible long-term cash incentive payments based on the achievement of prescribed corporate and/or individual performance metrics. The purpose of the LTI Cash Program is to foster and promote Farmers' long-term financial success and value by motivating performance through long-term incentive compensation, pending review and approval by the Compensation Committee. The LTI Cash Program is also intended to attract and retain the services of talented individuals and motivate participants to achieve performance objectives that promote sound and financially healthy growth. The LTI Cash Program may continue until terminated by the Board of Directors. 
The 2012 Equity Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders to promote Farmers' long-term financial success and increase shareholder value by motivating performance through equity-based long-term incentive compensation. The 2012 Equity Incentive Plan was also intended to encourage participants to acquire ownership interests in the Company, attract and retain talented executives and directors, and enable participants to participate in the Company's long-term growth and financial success. The 2017 Equity Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders in 2017 to continue these philosophies and long-term compensation opportunities. 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee established the target award opportunities under the LTI Cash Program and 2012 Equity Incentive Plan for each eligible named executive officer, expressed as a percentage of a participant's base salary, and established the following long-term incentive opportunity for each executive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 25% in service-based equity awards subject to three-year cliff vesting, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 75% in performance-based awards subject to vesting based on our relative performance on two objective financial measures as compared to the performance of  banking companies in our peer group measured over a three-year period ending December 31, 2018 ("Performance Period"):  
[END TABLE]

The following table indicates the threshold, target and maximum performance levels (for performance falling within each of the percentile ranges, payout or vesting was to occur on an interpolated basis) and the results of our relative TSR and relative average annual ROE performance, as adjusted, for the Performance Period, with the percentage payouts for the LTI Cash Program and 2012 Equity Incentive Plan awards granted in 2016. For performance falling below threshold, no award payout or vesting was to occur. Percentage payout opportunities for the cash-based awards under the LTI Cash Program ranged from 20% vesting for performing at the threshold 25th percentile of peer group, 100% for performing at the target 50th percentile, and 200% vesting for performing at or above the 75th percentile. The share-based awards under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan were granted at the maximum payout level of 200% of target opportunity, and percentage payout opportunities ranged from 10% vesting for performing at the threshold 25th percentile of peer group, 50% vesting for performing at the target 50th percentile, and 100% vesting for performing at or above the 75th percentile (equivalent to 200%, or maximum, of target opportunity). The following table summarizes the percentage payouts for our 2016 long-term performance awards. Although the Compensation Committee has certified performance and vesting levels for the 2016 long-term performance awards, the awards will not be settled until April 22, 2019. Payout amounts under the LTI Cash Program for each named executive officer are included in "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table located on page 41 of this proxy statement.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee established the long-term incentive compensation target opportunities for each eligible named executive officer under our LTI Cash Program   and our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, expressed as a percentage of base salary at the time of grant, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Mark L. Graham      40%  
 Mark J. Wenick      35%  
[END TABLE]
In conjunction with establishing the target long-term incentive opportunity for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee, determined to allocate 25% of our total long-term compensation opportunity to service-based awards, subject to three-year cliff vesting. We allocated the remaining 75% to performance-based awards, for which we continued to use relative TSR and relative average ROE as the performance metrics, with the same mix of cash-based and equity-based long-term incentive awards as follows: (i) 25% in cash-based awards under our LTI Cash Program subject to vesting based on relative TSR compared to our peer group over a performance period ending December 31, 2020, and (ii) 50% in equity-based grants under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan subject to vesting based on relative average ROE compared to our peer group over a performance period ending December 31, 2020. 
The following table indicates our intended payouts at the threshold, target and maximum levels for our 2018 long-term incentive awards under both the LTI Cash Program and the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, with relative performance compared to our 2018 Peer Group, consistent with grants of long-term incentive awards in recent years. The maximum award opportunity was established at 200% of the target opportunity.

Clawback Policy 
Farmers has adopted a clawback policy as part of its Incentive Compensation Guidelines. Pursuant to that policy, if the Company is required to restate all or a significant portion of its financial statements, the Board is empowered, in its discretion, to require reimbursement of all or any portion of bonuses paid or incentive compensation awarded to any participant in an incentive compensation program (including equity-based awards), and/or effect the   cancellation of all or any portion of unpaid awards which may be paid to such participants if: (a) the amount of the bonus or incentive compensation was calculated based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material restatement, and (b) the amount of the bonus or incentive compensation that would have been awarded to the participant, had the financial results been properly reported, would have been lower than the amount actually awarded. The Company acknowledges under this policy that it is not intended to add any forfeiture obligations or financial responsibilities to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer which are in addition to, or duplicative of, those obligations arising under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
Furthermore, if a participant in any incentive compensation program engages in misconduct related to such program, regardless of whether any restatement of financial statements is required as a result thereof, the Board shall take such actions as it considers appropriate to address the misconduct. Such actions may include cancellation of any unpaid portion of incentive compensation awarded to such participant, reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid to such participant, and other disciplinary actions. 
401(k) Plan and Company Contributions 
All of our employees who have completed at least one year of service and meet certain other eligibility requirements are eligible to participate in our 401(k) Profit Sharing Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees may voluntarily defer a portion of their annual compensation, subject to applicable federal restrictions and deferral limitations, and Farmers Bank matches a percentage of each participant's voluntary contributions, up to 6% of gross wages. In addition, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, Farmers Bank may make an additional profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) Plan. During 2018, Farmers Bank provided 401(k) Plan matching contributions of 50% for each of the named executive officers (subject to a maximum of 3% of gross wages), but no additional profit sharing contributions were made. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
In 2015, we adopted an unfunded nonqualified retirement plan for certain of our executive officers (the "Nonqualified Plan") pursuant to which such officers may voluntarily defer a greater portion of their compensation than permitted by applicable federal restrictions and deferral limitations in our 401(k) Plan. Participating officers are at all times 100% vested in their voluntary deferrals. The Company may also provide matching or discretionary credits to the accounts of eligible officers, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The Company currently intends to credit matching contributions equal to 50% of each participant's voluntary deferrals to the Nonqualified Plan, up to 6% of gross wages (or a 3% match). Any matching or discretionary credits under the Nonqualified Plan vest and become non-forfeitable in accordance with a specified formula that provides for partial vesting starting after completion of two years and full vesting after six years. Upon a Change-in-Control (as defined in the Nonqualified Plan), participants' benefits under the Nonqualified Plan become fully vested and non-forfeitable. Benefits under the Nonqualified Plan represent unsecured general obligations of the Company to pay participating officers at some time in the future. 
The Nonqualified Plan allows for discretionary additional annual contributions by the Company for the benefit of eligible participating officers, based on a percentage of each participant's total eligible compensation, as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. For calendar year 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a discretionary contribution in the amount of 2%.  The amounts accrued pursuant to the Nonqualified Plan for the benefit of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table located on page 41 of this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee believes that maintaining this Nonqualified Plan helps to maintain the competitiveness of our entire executive retirement benefits. 
Amounts payable to participating officers under the Nonqualified Plan will be distributed in accordance with the terms of the Nonqualified Plan and elections made by the participating officers. Benefits generally will be paid in a single lump sum unless the participating officer has elected to receive annual installments for a period of up to ten years. The benefits will be paid upon the earliest of a participating officer's separation from service death or disability unless the participating officer has elected to receive payments as of a specified date (including the earlier of that date or the occurrence of a regular distribution event). The Nonqualified Plan is subject to requirements affecting deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and is being administered in compliance with the applicable regulations under Section 409A. 
Perquisites and Other Compensation 
Executive officers also participate in broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, supplemental disability, retiree health insurance and term life insurance programs. Except for matching contributions in connection with our Nonqualified Plan as described above, and country club memberships provided by Farmers Bank to the named executive officers for customer relationship development purposes, executive officers did not receive any perquisites or personal benefits in 2018 that are not available to all employees. The amounts of these benefits are included in the "All Other Compensation" column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table located on page 41 of this proxy statement. 
Other Elements of Our Compensation Programs 
Employment Agreements, Separation Policy and Change in Control Arrangements 
The Compensation Committee carefully considers the use and conditions of any employment related agreements. Although employment agreements that contain severance and change in control arrangements may be appropriate to attract prospective executives who forego significant other employment opportunities, we determined in 2013 to terminate the existing employment agreements with our named executive officers and to adopt an Executive Separation Policy that applies to all of our named executive officers. In connection with that implementation, we entered into change in control agreements with each of our named executive officers ("Change in Control Agreements"). The material provisions of the Executive Separation Policy and the Change in Control Agreements are discussed under the caption "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION – Employment Agreements, Change in Control Agreements, Executive Separation Policy" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement. 
Overall, the Compensation Committee believes that the implementation of the Executive Separation Policy and Change in Control Agreements is appropriate to help ensure that Farmers will have the continued dedication, undivided loyalty and objective advice from its key executives, even in the event of a potential transaction, which could result in a change in control of Farmers. The Separation Policy offers certain protections in the event of certain terminations of employment, while the Change in Control Agreements provide certain   protections in the event of a change in control event, but only if the executive's employment is terminated as a result of (or within a specified period after) a change in control (i.e., a double trigger). The Compensation Committee does not believe that executives should receive compensation benefits merely as a result of a change in control; rather, it believes that our Change in Control Agreements provide our executive officers with adequate protection to help ensure that change in control offers will be evaluated by our executive officers in the best interests of Farmers and our shareholders without regard to concerns that a transaction could eliminate his or her job without appropriate dispensation. The Compensation Committee recognizes that these agreements may also tend to discourage a takeover attempt as a change in control could trigger increased compensation expense as part of the transaction. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code 
As applicable for 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") placed a limit on the tax deduction for compensation exceeding $1.0 million paid to the chief executive officer and four most highly compensated executive officers of a corporation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was adopted on December 22, 2017 and became effective on January 1, 2018, eliminated both the prior performance-based exception to the $1.0 million per-executive annual limit on deductibility of compensation under Section 162(m) and the exclusion of the chief financial officer. While the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors will continue to determine the level and structure of compensation in the manner they determine to be appropriate in order to attract and retain executive leadership and serve the needs of Farmers and its constituents, such levels and structure of executive compensation will no longer be considered within the framework of the Section 162(m) performance-based exception. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Anti-Hedging Policy 
As part of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines for our directors and executive officers which require that, within five years from the date a person first becomes a non-executive director, or within either eight years of March 15, 2016 or 11 years from the date an executive officer is first included as a participant in our Equity Plans (unless, due to specific facts and circumstances, a different period of time is determined to be appropriate by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee), the following amounts of Common Shares be owned by that person: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position     Minimum Ownership Requirement 
 Non-executive Director    4.0 x Annual Retainer Fee 
 Chief Executive Officer/President    2.0 x Annual Base Salary 
 Chief Banking Officer    1.5 x Annual Base Salary 
 Chief Financial Officer    1.25 x Annual Base Salary 
 Other Executive Officers    1.0 x Annual Base Salary 
[END TABLE]
Individuals subject to these guidelines are expected to satisfy certain milestones during the attainment periods to evidence that the individual is making appropriate progress toward achieving their respective ownership amount. In determining compliance with these guidelines, the Compensation Committee considers the beneficial ownership of our executive officers and directors as required to be reported in a proxy statement. 
In additional to these requirements, our executive officers and directors are prohibited under our insider trading policy and procedures from pledging our Common Shares,   purchasing our Common Shares on margin, engaging in short sales, or engaging in any hedging transaction involving our Common Shares. 
Director Compensation 
The Compensation Committee is also responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors compensation for our non-employee directors. Generally, director compensation is structured in a fashion to attract and retain high quality individuals to serve on the Board of Directors, to compensate such individuals for the time and energy expended in providing us their expertise, considering the size, nature and location of Farmers as a bank holding company competing in our markets. On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee requests that its compensation consultant evaluate our current director compensation levels relative to our peers. Generally, it is the overall goal of the Compensation Committee to position director compensation at a median market level. For 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended and the independent members of the Board of Directors approved (a) a general annual director retainer fee of $45,000, and (b) the following retainers for directors with additional duties: (i) $25,000 for the independent Board Chair, (ii) $20,000 for the independent Board Vice-Chair, (iii) $10,000 for the chair of the Executive Committee, and (iv) $5,000 for all other committee chairs. 
All director compensation amounts for 2018 are reflected in the Director Compensation table located on page 55 of this proxy statement. 
Oversight and Risk Management of Compensation Programs 
The Compensation Committee oversees the implementation and enforcement of our policies, procedures and practices related to its various compensation programs as part of its duties. This is designed to monitor our compensation policies to ensure that the compensation packages offered to its employees and executive officers do not present such individuals with the potential to engage in excessive or inappropriate risk taking activities. In addition, the Board Enterprise Risk Management Committee works with the Compensation Committee in order to monitor our compensation policies, procedures and practices, as part of its duties to monitor enterprise-wide risk. 
The Compensation and Board Enterprise Risk Management Committees believe that our current compensation structure for employees and executive officers does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking to the extent that it would reasonably likely lead to a material adverse effect. It is the opinion of the Compensation and Board Enterprise Risk Management Committees that our current compensation programs appropriately balance risk and the desire to focus on our short-term and the long-term goals without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During the last completed fiscal year, no member of the Compensation Committee was an officer or employee of Farmers or any of our subsidiaries, or was formerly an officer of Farmers or any of our subsidiaries. None of our directors had any business or financial relationship with us requiring disclosure in this proxy statement.  THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with Farmers' management. Based upon this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommends to the Board of Directors that this Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1)  Amounts shown reflect the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for equity awards granted during 2018 under our 2017  Equity Incentive Plan. As further reflected in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table located on page 43, (i) the amounts reported for service-based equity awards granted during 2018 were determined using closing price of a Common Share on the  date of grant of $13.50, and (ii) the amounts reported for performance-based equity awards granted during 2018 were determined using the closing price of a Common Share on the date of grant of $13.50 and the target vesting levels assuming our  average ROE performance equals the 50th percentile of the average of a group of peer companies over a three-year period ending on December 31, 2020. The maximum value of  the performance-based stock awards granted in 2018 to each named executive officer, assuming that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved and using the closing price of a Common Share on the date of grant of $13.50, is as  follows: Mr. Helmick, $222,642; Mr. Culp, $87,399; Mr. Witmer, $113,063; Mr. Graham, $66,555; and Mr. Wenick, $79,083.

2018 Named Executive Officer Compensation Components 
The primary elements of each executive officer's total compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table are the executive officer's base salary, annual incentive bonus, and long-term incentive compensation. Each executive officer also received certain other benefits as listed in the "All Other Compensation" column. 
Base Salary 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to implement its base salary positioning philosophy of seeking to establish executive officer base salaries at or near the 50th percentile of our peer group banks. Base salary increases to our named executive officers in 2018 were consistent generally with baseline increases approved for all employees, except where further adjustments were warranted based on outstanding or poor personal performance or peer market median alignment. Each named executive officer's base salary is reviewed annually and is subject to adjustments based upon our financial performance, individual performance and our overall compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of Mr. Helmick in light of specified goals and objectives with input from each independent director. Based on such evaluation and input, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation of Mr. Helmick and discusses its determination with all independent directors. All other executive officers are evaluated on a variety of factors including leadership performance, strategic planning and execution, communication abilities, business knowledge, and awareness and accountability. Based thereon, Mr. Helmick determines whether a base salary increase or decrease is considered to be merited based upon individual performance and presents his base salary adjustment recommendations to the Compensation Committee. As a result of the evaluations by the Compensation Committee of Mr. Helmick, and the recommendations by Mr. Helmick regarding the remaining named executive officers as described above, the following merit-based base salary adjustments were made in 2018: (i) Mr. Helmick received a base salary increase of 3.5% to $445,000; (ii) Mr. Culp received a base salary increase of approximately 16% to $240,005, based on a peer group based market adjustment and annual evaluation; (ii) Mr. Witmer received a base salary increase of approximately 3% to $275,000; (iv) Mr. Graham received a base salary increase of approximately 3% to $182,228; and (v) Mr. Wenick received a base salary increase of approximately 9% to $249,990. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
Our Annual Incentive Plan provides certain of our executive officers and non-executive employees the opportunity to receive annual cash incentive payments based upon achievement of certain corporate and individual performance goals. The Annual Incentive Plan is intended to foster superior financial results by providing corporate-wide incentives that reward individual and team effort to achieve specified performance objectives   determined for each fiscal year. The 2018 target bonus award opportunities (expressed as a percentage of base salary) and the 2018 bonus targets for each named executive officer under the Annual Incentive Plan are disclosed on page 30 of this proxy statement under "2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan." 
Payments under the Annual Incentive Plan are contingent primarily upon the achievement of pre-established performance goals during a fiscal year relating to objective financial metrics established by the Compensation Committee, and secondarily upon the results of a subjective evaluation of each individual executive's performance. Each of the elements has an assigned weight and each of the objective financial criteria has a specific target or goal for the year. In the event that we (or the individual participant) do not meet the specified goal or target for a particular metric, then no compensation will be paid with respect to that objective portion of the Annual Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee established a threshold payout of 50% of target opportunity upon attaining 80% of the objective metric targets, a target payout of 100% upon attainment of 100% of the objective metric targets, and a maximum payout of 150% of target opportunity. For performance falling within each of the percentile ranges, payouts are made on an interpolated basis. 
In establishing the Annual Incentive Plan's objective metrics and targets for 2018, the Compensation Committee utilized the Company's budgeting model to set the performance at levels that were determined to be achievable with strong management performance. All named executive officers were allocated certain weightings of the following three core corporate financial measures: earnings per share, efficiency ratio, and return on average assets. Those were the sole objective performance criteria allocated to Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer. The named executive officers other than Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer had significant additional objective metrics based on their specific areas of responsibility and oversight. Finally, in addition to the objective performance metrics, a subjective metric was included for each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Graham, with a weighting of 20% of the total bonus opportunity for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, and Witmer and a weighting of 15% for Mr. Wenick. The objective performance metrics, weightings, targets and percentage payouts based on actual performance for each of our named executive officers under the Annual Incentive Plan in 2018 is set forth in detail in the tables beginning on page 30 of this proxy statement under "2018 Named Executive Officers Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan." 
Payouts under the subjective element for each named executive officer were based on evaluations of overall job performance during 2018 using an extensive performance review scorecard for each executive. For each named executive officer other than Mr. Helmick, the scorecards were completed by Mr. Helmick and provided the basis of his recommendations to the Compensation Committee for the subjective portion of the executive's bonus for 2018. For Mr. Helmick, each member of the Board of Directors completed a scorecard which were reviewed by the Compensation Committee in reaching a determination with respect to the subjective element of Mr. Helmick's 2018 annual bonus. Based upon such reviews, the Compensation Committee approved the following percentage payouts with respect to the subjective element of the total bonus opportunity for 2018: (i) Mr. Helmick, 100% of the possible 20% weighting; (ii) Mr. Culp, 100% of the possible 20% weighting; (iii) Mr. Witmer, 100% of the possible 20% weighting; and (iv) Mr. Wenick, 100% of the possible 15% weighting. 
Finally, the Compensation Committee includes a circuit breaker in the Annual Incentive Plan based on our "Texas ratio" for the year, determined by dividing the amount of Farmers Bank's non-performing loans, other real estate owned and loans delinquent for more than 90   days, by Farmers Bank's tangible capital equity plus its loan loss reserves. If this ratio exceeds 20% for the year, no bonuses are payable under the Annual Incentive Plan. Farmers' Texas ratio for 2018 was 3.25%, well below this circuit breaker level. The Compensation Committee believes that the use of a circuit breaker as part of our annual bonus program helps maintain minimum levels of safety and soundness of our institution while seeking to provide appropriate near-term incentives for achieving superior financial performance objectives. 
As a result of the performance of Farmers with respect to the above-described objective metrics and each named executive officer's individual performance evaluations, the Compensation Committee awarded the following payouts with respect to 2018 performance under the Annual Incentive Plan:

 Mark J. Wenick    $ 115,089        132%  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the issuance to our named executive officers of (i) service-based long-term incentive awards, (ii) performance-based long-term equity incentive awards, and (iii) performance-based long-term cash incentive awards, under both our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and our LTI Cash Program, the amounts of which are set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table located on page 43 of this proxy statement. The amounts of these long-term equity incentive awards and those granted in 2016 and 2017 are set forth below in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Year-End table.

Summary of Equity Awards Vested in 2018 
During 2018, equity awards subject to normal vesting for our named executive officers consisted of performance-based long-term awards granted in calendar 2015 which were subject to performance-based vesting. With regard to the performance-based equity awards, 50.85% vested because our relative average ROE for the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2017 of 9.46 placed us at the 62nd percentile of our peer group. 
In 2015, the Compensation Committee also approved the one-time issuance of service-based long-term equity incentive awards to our executive officers to help retain our management team following the significant growth in Farmers and to reward them for successfully executing on our strategic acquisition plan with two completed acquisitions in 2015.

Employment Agreements, Change in Control Agreements, Executive Separation Policy 
Farmers has no written employment agreements with any of its 2018 named executive officers, although certain potential benefits in connection with their employment are governed by an Executive Separation Policy and a Change in Control Agreement, the material terms of which are described below. 
Change in Control Agreements 
Farmers has entered into Change in Control Agreements with each of its executive officers, including all of its current named executive officers. 
In the event that an executive officer's employment is terminated by Farmers, other than for Cause, or by the executive, for Good Reason, during the six-month period commencing prior to a Change in Control (all as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) or the 12-month period thereafter, then the executive would be eligible to receive the benefits set forth in the Change in Control Agreement. Those benefits include (i) a payment in an amount equal to a multiple of the executive's annual base salary (three times for Mr. Helmick, two and one-half times for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, and two times for Mr. Wenick); (ii) a lump sum amount equal to a multiple of the average of the annual incentive bonus paid to the executive in the three years preceding termination (three times for Mr. Helmick, two and one-half times for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, two times for Mr. Wenick); (iii) a pro rata incentive bonus of the year of termination which assumes that performance has been attained at the "target" level for each executive; (iv) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the executive to continue to receive health benefits at a level similar to which the executive and his spouse and dependents were participating for a period of months (36 for Mr. Helmick, 30 for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, or 24 for Mr. Wenick); and (v) for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick, a lump sum of $20,000 for outplacement services.  Each of the Change in Control Agreements provide for a "cut-back" in the event of any excise tax under Section 280G of the Code, such that the benefits payable to the executive would be reduced to $1.00 less than the amount that causes the payments to be treated as parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code; provided, however, that no reduction will occur if, on an after-tax basis in each case and taking into account all federal, state and local taxes (including any excise tax), the executive would receive a greater amount if no reduction had occurred, thus providing the "best net effect" to the executive. 
In order to receive the benefits described above, the executive would be required to execute a general release in favor of Farmers and must also (i) comply with covenants prohibiting the solicitation of customers and employees (for a period of 36 months for Mr. Helmick, and 24 months for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick) (ii) maintain the confidentiality of Farmers' proprietary and confidential information and (iii) comply with non-disparagement provisions. 
Executive Separation Policy 
Farmers has adopted an Executive Separation Policy which applies to our Chief Executive Officer and President, Senior Executive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer, Senior Executive Vice President – Chief Banking Officer, Executive Vice President – Chief Credit Officer, and such other persons as may be designated annually by the Board of Directors, including currently our Senior Vice President, Chief Lending Officer and Regional President, among other executive officers (collectively, the "Covered Executives"). Accordingly, each of our named executive officers is a Covered Executive and participates in the Executive Separation Policy. 
In the event that a Covered Executive's employment is terminated by Farmers for Cause or by the Covered Executive without Good Reason (each as defined in the Executive Separation Policy), then the Covered Executive would be entitled to receive (i) all earned but unpaid compensation benefits for time worked through the date of termination; and (ii) such other rights and benefits, if any, as may be provide under other plans and programs of Farmers (collectively, the "Accrued Obligations"). 
If the Covered Executives employment is terminated by Farmers without Cause or by the Covered Executive with Good Reason, then, in addition to the Accrued Obligations, the Covered Executive would be eligible to receive the following (i) a lump sum equal to 36-months' salary for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer and Graham, or 24-months' salary for Mr. Wenick; (ii) a pro rata incentive bonus in a lump sum equal to the bonus the Covered Executive would have earned (assuming performance at the "target" level); (iii) a lump sum amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the Covered Executive to continue to receive health benefits at a level similar to which the Covered Executive and his or her spouse and dependents were receiving multiplied by 36 (for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, and Graham) or 24 (for Mr. Wenick); and (iv) a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed $10,000 (for Mr. Helmick) or $7,500 (for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick) for reasonable outplacement services for up to one year by a firm selected by Farmers. 
The Executive Separation Policy defines "Good Reason" to include any of the following: (a) a reduction in a Covered Executive's annual base salary rate, unless such reduction generally applies to other Covered Executives regardless of the reason(s) therefore; (b) a substantial diminution in a Covered Executive's duties, authorities or responsibilities; or (3) the relocation of a Covered Executive's principal place of employment with the Company that meets certain conditions in the Executive Separation Policy. The Executive Separation   Policy defines "Cause" to mean (a) the willful or negligent failure by the Covered Executive to substantially perform his or her duties with the Company and, after written notification by the Company to the Covered Executive, the continued failure of the Covered Executive to substantially perform such duties; (b) the willful or negligent engagement by the Covered Executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, financially or otherwise; (c) action or inaction by the Covered Executive that constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (d) the violation of any material written policy, rule or regulation of the Company; or (e) the Covered Executive's material breach of any agreement in respect of confidentiality with the Company, whether or not entered into after the effective date of the Executive Separation Policy. 
In order to receive any payments pursuant to the Executive Separation Policy (other than the Accrued Obligations), the Covered Executive would be required to execute a general release in favor of Farmers and must also (i) comply with a non-competition covenant for 12 months; (ii) comply with covenants prohibiting the solicitation of customers and employees for a period of time equal to 24 months (for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick); (iii) maintain the confidentiality of Farmers' proprietary and confidential information and (iv) comply with non-disparagement provisions. Failure to abide by these conditions requires the Covered Executive to return to Farmers, within 10 days after request by Farmers, any amounts Farmers has paid to the Covered Executive under the Executive Separation Policy (other than the Accrued Obligations). 
In the event that a Covered Executive is terminated under circumstances that would entitle him or her to payment under a Change in Control Agreement, then the terms of the Change in Control Agreement will be controlling and the Covered Executive would not be entitled to benefits under the Executive Separation Policy.  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table sets forth a summary of the potential amounts payable to each named executive officer under various termination scenarios including those provided pursuant to the terms of the Executive Separation Policy and Change in Control Agreements described in the section titled "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION — Employment Agreements, Change in Control Agreements, Executive Separation Policy" beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement. The figures in the table assume termination occurring on December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  No severance benefits are provided upon a named executive officer's death or disability other than (i) payment of the target amount under our  Annual Incentive Plan, (ii) vesting of long-term incentive plan awards, and (iii) amounts vested under our Nonqualified Plan. All outstanding service-based awards fully vest upon death or disability. A pro rata portion of outstanding  performance-based awards, both cash- and equity-based, vest upon death or disability, but are settled only at the end of the normal vesting period and only to the extent of determined by the performance criteria over the performance period. For  purposes of this calculation, it was assumed that the pro rata amount of outstanding performance-based long-term incentive awards would vest at their target levels of performance. The value of all equity awards for these purposes was calculated  using the closing price of our Common Shares on December 31, 2018 of $12.74.Farmers considers normal retirement age to be 65 years of age, and no named executive officer was eligible for treatment as a retirement upon a voluntary resignation at  December 31, 2018.  
(2)  Our Executive Separation Policy provides the participating executives with the following benefits as a result of a voluntary termination without Good  Reason or an involuntary termination by Farmers Bank for Cause (each as defined in the Executive Separation Policy): (a) their Accrued Obligations; and (b) any rights and benefits, if any, provided under plans and programs of the Company,  determined in accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of such plans and programs, including, without limitation, earned but unused vacation (however the table assumes that the executives would receive no benefit for unused paid time off  as of December 31, 2018, as unused paid time off cannot be carried over from one year to the next).  
(3)  Our Executive Separation Policy generally provides the Covered Executives the following benefits as a result of a termination by the Company without  Cause or by the Covered Executives for Good Reason: (a) the Accrued Obligations, (b) a lump sum equal to 36-months' salary for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, and Graham, or 24-months' salary for Mr. Wenick; (c) a pro rata incentive bonus in a lump sum equal to the bonus the Covered Executive would have earned (assuming performance at the "target" level); (d) a  lump sum amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the Covered Executive to continue to receive health benefits at a level similar to which the Covered Executive and his or her spouse and dependents were receiving multiplied by 36 (for  Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, and Graham) or 24 (for Mr. Wenick); and (e) a lump sum payment in an amount not to exceed $10,000 (for Mr. Helmick) or $7,500 (for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick) for reasonable outplacement  services for up to one year by a firm selected by Farmers. All outstanding service-based awards fully vest (calculated using the closing price of our Common Shares on December 31, 2018 of $12.74), and all outstanding performance-based awards  are forfeited. Because termination is assumed for purposes of the table to have occurred on December 31, 2018, the annual incentive benefit payable to the executives is a full year bonus at the "target" level and not a pro rata  portion of that annual incentive benefit. The table also assumes that the executives would receive no benefit for unused paid time off as of December 31, 2018, as unused paid time off cannot be carried over from one year to the next.   
(4)  The Change in Control Agreements with our named executive officers provide for the following payments if employment is terminated by the Company other  than for Cause or by the executive for Good Reason (as each defined in the Change in Control Agreements): (a) a payment in an amount equal to the executive's annual base salary multiplied by three for Mr. Helmick, two and one-half for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, two for Mr. Wenick, or one for all other executive officers; (b) a lump sum amount equal to the average of the annual incentive bonus paid to the executive in  the three years preceding termination multiplied by three for Mr. Helmick, two and one-half for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, two for Mr. Wenick, or one for all other executive officers;  (c) a pro rata incentive bonus of the year of termination (assuming performance had been attained at the "target" level); (d) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the monthly COBRA premium payable by the executive to continue to  receive health benefits at a level similar to which the executive and his spouse and dependents were participating multiplied by 36 for Mr. Helmick, 30 for Messrs. Culp, Witmer, and Graham, 24 for Mr. Wenick, or 12 for all other executive  officers; and (e) a lump sum of $20,000 for outplacement services for Messrs. Helmick, Culp, Witmer, Graham, and Wenick. Upon a voluntary termination for Good Reason or an involuntary termination without Cause within two years following a  Change in Control, (i) all outstanding service-based awards fully vest, and (ii) all outstanding performance-based long-term incentive awards vest and are settled at the "target" level of performance. The value of all equity  awards for these purposes was calculated using the closing price of our Common Shares on December 31, 2018 of $12.74.  
(5)  Upon death or disability (i) all outstanding service-based awards fully vest, and (ii) a pro rata portion of outstanding performance-based  awards, both cash- and equity-based, vest subject to settlement only at the end of the normal vesting period and only to the extent determined by the performance criteria over the performance period. For purposes of these calculations, it was  assumed that the pro rata amount of outstanding performance-based long-term incentive awards would vest at target levels of performance. Upon voluntary termination without Good Reason or involuntary termination for Cause all outstanding long-term  incentive awards are forfeited. Upon voluntary termination with Good Reason or involuntary termination without Cause (i) all outstanding service-based awards fully vest, and (ii) all outstanding performance-based awards are forfeited. Upon  a voluntary termination for Good Reason or an involuntary termination without Cause within two years following a Change in Control, (i) all outstanding service-based awards fully vest, and (ii) all outstanding performance-based long-term  incentive awards vest and are settled at the "target" level of performance. The value of all equity awards for these purposes was calculated using the closing price of our Common Shares on December 31, 2018 of $12.74.

 CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
CEO Pay Ratio 
Pursuant to Commission regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act we are required to calculate and disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer, Mr. Helmick, compared to the total annual compensation of our employee whose compensation represents the median compensation of all employees other than Mr. Helmick. 
To identify such "median employee" we added the salary paid to each employee (other than Mr. Helmick) during 2017 plus all other compensation paid to each employee for services rendered during 2017, to arrive at total compensation paid to each employee with respect to 2017. We used the amount of salary paid during 2017, rather than salary paid for services rendered during 2018 regardless of when actually paid, for purposes of identifying the median employee. We calculated the compensation of each of our 457 employees who was employed by the Company as of December 31, 2017. The compensation of full-time, permanent employees who were hired after January 1, 2017 was annualized. The compensation of part-time, temporary and seasonal employees was not adjusted to a full-time or full-year equivalent. We included for each employee all forms of compensation that were paid to that employee during 2017, including, as applicable, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary or wages, including overtime  
• Bonuses  
• Grants of time-based long-term incentive compensation awards  
• Other incentive compensation, including vesting of performance-based long-term incentive compensation awards  
• Service awards for years of service to Farmers  
• Christmas gifts  
• 401(k) plan matching contributions  
• Nonqualified deferred compensation  
• Nonqualified executive retirement compensation  
• Health insurance premiums  
• Group term life insurance, AD&D, and long-term and short-term disability premiums  
[END TABLE]
After calculating each employee's annual total compensation, we ranked the annual total compensation of all employees other than Mr. Helmick from lowest to highest and identified the middle employee in the list as the median employee for purposes of our CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure in our 2018 proxy statement. We continued to use that identified median employee for purposes of our CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure in this proxy statement, based on a calculation of the annual total compensation of both Mr. Helmick and such median employee for the 2018 calendar year in a manner consistent with the rules for determining amounts disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table located on page 41. The calculations yielded the following numbers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Annual total compensation of Mr. Helmick    $ 1,021,548   
    The median employees annual total compensation    $  43,977   
    The ratio of annual total compensation of Mr. Helmick to the median employees annual total  compensation:      23.23:1

The Compensation Committee believes our compensation program must be equitable to all employees to motivate our employees to perform in manners that enhance shareholder value. We will continue to monitor the relationship of the compensation of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, to the compensation of non-executive employees.  PROPOSAL THREE — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Farmers is providing shareholders with the right to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the following resolution relative to the compensation of the Company's named executive officers: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Farmers' named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this proxy statement." 
As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors believes that Farmers' compensation policies and procedures are aligned with Farmers' short-term goals and long-term success. The Board of Directors believes that its improved pay-for-performance philosophy and objectively-driven incentive-based compensation opportunities are designed to both be competitive with opportunities offered by similarly situated financial institutions and to attract, retain and motivate the key executives directly responsible for our continued success. At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the executive compensation as disclosed in the proxy statement for that Annual Meeting, with 93% of the Common Shares represented by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy voting for approval. The Compensation Committee evaluated the results of this supportive advisory vote, together with the other factors and data discussed in this Compensation and Discussion Analysis, in determining executive compensation policies, making executive compensation decisions, and continuing implementation of its compensation philosophy and objectives. 
Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Compensation Tables" sections of this proxy statement, including the related narrative, for additional details about our executive compensation philosophy and programs, including information about the calendar year 2018 compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
Vote Required and Board of Directors' Recommendation 
This Proposal Three to approve the resolution regarding the compensation of Farmers' named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal Three and, thus, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Three. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding on Farmers or the Board of Directors; however, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" 
APPROVAL OF THE ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Management is responsible for Farmers' internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of Farmers' consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes, and the Committee Chair, as representative of the Committee, discusses the interim financial information contained in quarterly earnings announcements with both management and the independent registered public accounting firm prior to public release. The Audit Committee also recommends to the Board of Directors the selection of Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm and must pre-approve all services provided. 
NASDAQ rules require each member of the Audit Committee to be able to read and understand financial statements. The Company believes that each member of the Audit Committee as constituted satisfies this requirement. Members of the Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm, although each member of the Audit Committee has the authority to engage and determine funding for independent advisors as deemed necessary. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of Farmers' financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in fact "independent." 
In this context, the Audit Committee met and held discussions with Farmers' management, who represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with both management and Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018, Crowe LLP ("Crowe"). The Audit Committee also discussed with Crowe matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard (AS) 1301 (previously AS No. 16). Crowe provided to the Audit Committee written disclosures pursuant to Rule 3526 of the PCAOB (Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence). The Audit Committee has discussed with Crowe any relationships with or services to Farmers' or its subsidiaries that may impact the objectivity and independence of Crowe, and the Audit Committee has satisfied itself as to Crowe's independence. 
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussion with management and Crowe, and the Committee's review of the representation of management and the report of Crowe to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in Farmers' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Commission. On January 29, 2019, the Company notified Crowe that it has been dismissed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective as of the completion of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also recommended that CliftonLarsonAllen LLP be retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 calendar year. 
The Audit Committee: 
Gregory C. Bestic, Chair 
Ralph D. Macali 
Gregg Strollo  PROPOSAL FOUR — RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Upon the recommendation and approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the approval by the Board of Directors, the Company has selected CliftonLarsonAllen LLP ("CLA") to act as the independent registered public accounting firm to examine Farmers' books, records and accounts and those of its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019. This appointment is being presented to shareholders for ratification or rejection at the Annual Meeting. 
On January 29, 2019, the Company notified Crowe that it has been dismissed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective as of the completion of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Crowe has served as the Company's independent public accounting firm since 2003. Crowe served as the Company's independent public accounting firm until the completion of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 
On January 30, 2019, the Company appointed CLA to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, upon the recommendation and approval of the Audit Committee and the approval by the Board of Directors. The appointment of CLA resulted from a competitive request for proposal process undertaken by the Audit Committee pursuant to which the Audit Committee received proposals from CLA, Crowe, and one other independent registered public accounting firm. 
Crowe's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, and the subsequent interim period through January 30, 2019, (i) there were no disagreements between the Company and Crowe on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Crowe, would have caused Crowe to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its report on the consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304 of Regulation S-K. 
CLA is considered by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors to be well qualified. By NASDAQ and Commission rules and regulations, selection of Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm is the direct responsibility of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has determined, however, to seek shareholder ratification of this selection as both a good corporate practice and to provide shareholders an avenue to express their views on this important matter. 
The proposal to ratify the appointment of Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on Proposal Four. Broker non-votes may be counted as votes "For" Proposal Four. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal Four and thus will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Four. If shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will seek to understand the reasons for such failure and will take those views into account in this and future appointments of Farmers' independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the   current selection is ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee reserves the right to terminate the engagement of CLA and appoint a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Representatives of Crowe and CLA will be present at the Annual Meeting to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EACH RECOMMEND A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF CLIFTONLARSONALLEN LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees 
Fees for professional services rendered by Crowe for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 344,000      $ 377,000   
 Audit-Related Fees    $  34,000      $ 32,500   
 Tax Fees    $  42,300      $ 51,450   
 All Other Fees    $  7,500      $ 7,500   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees consist of consist of fees billed in the last two fiscal years for the audit of Farmers' annual financial statements, the review of financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, statutory and subsidiary audits and services provided in connection with regulatory filings during those two years. 
Audit-Related Fees consist of fees billed in the last two fiscal years for accounting consultations and assurance services reasonably related to the audit and review of Farmers' financial statements. The fees billed in 2018 and 2017 include services related to providing required consents. 
Tax Fees represent fees for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. 
All Other Fees represent fees for advice related to a captive insurance subsidiary project. 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of Crowe and has concluded that it is. 
Pre-Approval of Fees 
Under applicable Commission rules, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to assure that the provision of the services does not impair the firm's independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Committee. In addition, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels require specific Audit Committee pre-approval. The Audit Committee also reviews, generally on a quarterly basis, reports summarizing the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. All of the services related to Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees or All Other Fees described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee's pre-approval policy is contained in the Audit Committee Charter, a current copy of which is available at www.farmersbankgroup.com.  PROPOSAL FIVE — APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING, 
IF NECESSARY, TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES 
General 
If there are insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to adopt Proposal Two, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion if it determines necessary, adjourn the Annual Meeting to solicit additional proxies. In that event, you will be asked to vote only upon this Proposal Five and not on any other proposals. In this Proposal Five, Farmers is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Board of Directors to vote in favor of adjourning the Annual Meeting. If this Proposal Five is approved, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion if necessary, adjourn the Annual Meeting and any adjourned session of the Annual Meeting, to provide further time to solicit additional proxies in favor of Proposal Two, including the solicitation of proxies from shareholders that have previously voted against such proposal. Among other things, approval of this adjournment proposal could mean that, even if proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against Proposal Two have been received, Farmers could adjourn the Annual Meeting without a vote on the proposal and seek to convince the holders of such common shares to change their votes in favor of Proposal Two. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulations, no notice of an adjourned meeting need be given to shareholders if the date, time and place of the adjourned meeting are fixed and announced at the Annual Meeting; provided, however, in the event that the Annual Meeting is adjourned to a date after May 3, 2019, the Board of Directors will be required to fix a new record date for the Annual Meeting and a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to all shareholders. At the adjourned meeting, Farmers may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. 
Vote Required and Board of Directors' Recommendation 
The proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares present, represented and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of Proposal Two and, thus, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Two. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" 
APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY, 
TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES TO ADOPT PROPOSAL TWO.  INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE 
The Audit Committee Report and the Compensation Committee Report in this proxy statement are not deemed filed with the Commission and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any prior or future filings made by Farmers under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates such information by reference.

The tangible common equity ratio is calculated by dividing total common stockholders' equity by total assets, after reducing both amounts by intangible assets. The tangible common equity ratio is not required by U.S. GAAP or by applicable bank regulatory requirements, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of our capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the tangible common equity ratio, our tangible common equity ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and tangible assets are non U.S. GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. With respect to the calculation of the actual unaudited tangible common equity ratio as of December 31, 2018, reconciliations of tangible common equity to U.S. GAAP total common stockholders' equity and tangible assets to U.S. GAAP total assets are set forth above.
