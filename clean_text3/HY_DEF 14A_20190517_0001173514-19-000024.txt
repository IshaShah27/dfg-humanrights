PROXY STATEMENT — MARCH 26, 2019 
[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc., a Delaware corporation, of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company to be held on May 17, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting").  The terms the "Company," "Hyster-Yale," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc.  This Proxy Statement and the related form of proxy are being mailed to stockholders commencing on or about March 26, 2019.
If the enclosed form of proxy is executed, dated and returned or if you vote electronically, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as directed on all matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting for a vote.  Proxies that are properly signed without any indication of voting instructions will be voted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for the election of each director nominee;  
• to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation; 
• for the frequency of future advisory votes to approve, on an advisory basis,  the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation to be set at one year; 
• to approve the Company's Non-Employee Directors' Equity Compensation Plan;  
• for the confirmation of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, for the current fiscal year; and 
• as recommended by our Board of Directors with regard to any other matters or, if no recommendation is given, in the proxy holders' own discretion. 
[END TABLE]
The proxies may be revoked at any time prior to their exercise by giving notice to us in writing or by executing and delivering a later dated proxy.  Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke a proxy, but a stockholder of record attending the Annual Meeting may request a ballot and vote in person, thereby revoking a previously granted proxy.
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2019 will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.  On that date, we had 12,775,581 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common"), entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and 3,875,763 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Common"), entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Each share of Class A Common is entitled to one vote for a nominee for each of the eleven directorships to be filled and one vote on each other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting.  Each share of Class B Common is entitled to ten votes for each such nominee and ten votes on each other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting.  Class A Common and Class B Common will vote as a single class on all matters anticipated to be brought before the Annual Meeting. 
At the Annual Meeting, in accordance with Delaware law and our Bylaws, the inspectors of election appointed by the Board of Directors for the Annual Meeting will determine the presence of a quorum and will tabulate the results of stockholder voting.  As provided by Delaware law and our Bylaws, the holders of a majority of our stock, issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, will constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting.  The inspectors of election intend to treat properly executed proxies marked "abstain" as "present" for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the Annual Meeting.  The inspectors of election will also treat proxies held in "street name" by brokers that are voted on at least one, but not all, of the proposals to come before the Annual Meeting ("broker non-votes") as "present" for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the Annual Meeting.
In accordance with Delaware law, the eleven director nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected directors.  
Proposals 2 and 3 are advisory in nature and non-binding.  Although non-binding, voting on the proposals will allow our Stockholders to express their opinion regarding Named Executive Officer compensation and the frequency by which such advisory votes shall occur.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of such proposals.
In accordance with our Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our stock that is present in person or represented by proxy and that is actually voted is required to approve all other proposals that are brought  Table of Contents before the Annual Meeting.  As a result, abstentions and broker non-votes in respect of any such proposal will not be counted and will have no effect for purposes of determining whether a proposal has received the requisite approval by our stockholders.
In accordance with Delaware law and our Bylaws, we may, by a vote of the stockholders, in person or by proxy, adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date or dates, without changing the record date.  If we were to determine that an adjournment was desirable, the appointed proxies would use the discretionary authority granted pursuant to the proxy cards to vote in favor of such an adjournment.

Our Board of Directors held seven meetings in 2018.  During their tenure in 2018, all of the directors attended at least 75% of the total meetings held by our Board of Directors and by the committees on which they served.
Our Board of Directors has determined that, based primarily on the ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common by the members of the Taplin and Rankin families and their voting history, we have the characteristics of, and may be, a "controlled company," as defined in Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards.  While our Board of Directors has determined that we could be characterized as a "controlled company," it has elected not to make use at the present time of any of the exceptions to the NYSE listing standards that are available to controlled companies. 
In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, our non-management directors are scheduled to meet in executive session, without management, once a year.  The Chairman of the Compensation Committee will preside at such meeting.  Additional meetings of the non-management directors may be scheduled when the non-management directors believe such meetings are desirable.  The determination of the director who should preside at such additional meetings will be made based upon the principal subject matter to be discussed at each such meeting.  A meeting of the non-management directors was held on February 19, 2019.
We hold a regularly-scheduled meeting of our Board of Directors in conjunction with our annual meeting of stockholders.  Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders absent an appropriate excuse.  All of our directors who were directors on the date of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the annual meeting in person, by telephone or by other electronic means. Table of Contents

Board Leadership Structure 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that it is prudent and in the best interests of stockholders that the CEO and Chairman positions be combined and that such combination has no negative effect on the operation or direction of the Company.  Alfred M. Rankin, Jr., the Company's CEO, is the most appropriate person to serve as our Chairman because he possesses in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing our business.  Because of this knowledge and insight, the Board of Directors believes that Mr. Rankin is in the best position to effectively identify strategic opportunities and priorities and to lead discussions regarding the execution of the Company's strategies and achievement of its objectives.  As Chairman, our CEO is able to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• focus our Board of Directors on the most significant strategic goals and risks of our business; 
• utilize the individual qualifications, skills and experience of the other members of the Board of Directors to maximize their contributions to our Board of Directors; 
• assess whether each other member of our Board of Directors has sufficient knowledge and understanding of our business to enable them to make informed judgments; 
• promote a seamless flow of information to our Board of Directors;  
• facilitate the flow of information between our Board of Directors and our management; and 
• provide the perspective of a long-term stockholder. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, Colin Wilson is the CEO of our principal operating subsidiary, Hyster-Yale Group, Inc. ("HYG"), and as such is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the business.  This arrangement allows Mr. Rankin to focus almost exclusively on the strategic opportunities and priorities of the overall business.
We do not assign a lead independent director, but the Chairman of our Compensation Committee presides at the regularly-scheduled meetings of non-management directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Oversight of Risk Management 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that strong and effective controls and risk management processes are essential components needed to achieve long-term stockholder value.  The Board, directly and through its committees, is responsible for overseeing risks that potentially affect the Company.  Each Board committee is responsible for oversight of risk categories related to the Committee's specific function, while our full Board exercises ultimate responsibility for overseeing the risk management as a whole.  The respective areas of risk oversight exercised by our Board and its committees are as follows: Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board/Committee   Primary Areas of Risk Oversight 
Full Board• Oversees overall Company risk management procedures, including operational and strategic, and regularly receives and evaluates reports and presentations from the Chairs of the Audit Review, Compensation, NCG, Planning Advisory and Finance Committees on risk-related matters falling within each respective committee's oversight responsibilities 
Audit Review Committee• Oversees financial and legal risks by regularly reviewing reports and presentations given by management, including our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Director, Internal Audit, as well as other operational Company personnel, and evaluates potential related-person transactions 
• Regularly reviews our risk management practices and risk-related policies (for example, the Company's Code of Corporate Conduct and legal and regulatory reviews) and evaluates potential risks related to internal control over financial reporting 
NCG Committee• Oversees potential risks related to our governance practices by, among other things, reviewing succession plans and performance evaluations of the Board and CEO 
Compensation Committee• Oversees potential risks related to the design and administration of our compensation plans, policies and programs, including our performance-based compensation programs, to promote appropriate incentives that do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk-taking by our executive officers or other employees 
Finance Committee• Regularly reviews risks related to financing and other risk management strategies, including reviews of our insurance portfolios 
Planning Advisory Committee• Assists the Board in its oversight of the Company's key strategies, projects and initiatives 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Code of Conduct 
[END TABLE]
We have adopted a code of ethics, entitled "Code of Corporate Conduct," applicable to all of our personnel, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and other persons performing similar functions.  Waivers of our Code of Corporate Conduct, if any, for our directors or executive officers may be disclosed on our website, by press release or by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.  The Code of Corporate Conduct and the Independence Standards for Directors, as well as each of the charters of the Audit Review, Compensation and NCG Committees, are available free of charge on our website at http://www.hyster-yale.com, under the heading "Corporate Governance."  The information contained on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement and you should not consider such information to be part of this Proxy Statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Review Committee reviews all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest in such transactions.  Our legal department is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related-person transactions in order to enable the Audit Review Committee to determine whether we have, or a related-person has, a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction.  In the course of the review of a potentially-material related-person transaction, the Audit Review Committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related-person's interest in the transaction; 
• the material terms of the transaction, including, without limitation, the amount and type of transaction; 
• the importance of the transaction to the related-person; 
• the importance of the transaction to the Company; 
• whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in our best interest; and 
• any other matters the Audit Review Committee deems appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this review, the Audit Review Committee will determine whether to approve or ratify any transaction that is directly or indirectly material to us or a related-person.
Any member of the Audit Review Committee who is a related-person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote with respect to the approval or ratification of the transaction.  However, such director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Audit Review Committee that considers the transaction. Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Communication with Directors 
[END TABLE]
Our stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with our Board of Directors as a group, with the non-management directors as a group, or with any individual director by sending written communications to Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc., 5875 Landerbrook Drive, Suite 300, Cleveland, Ohio 44124-4069, Attention: Secretary.  Complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters will be forwarded directly to the Chairman of the Audit Review Committee.  All other communications will be provided to the individual director(s) or group of directors to whom they are addressed.  Copies of all communications will be provided to all other directors; provided, however, that any such communications that are considered to be improper for submission to the intended recipients will not be provided to the directors.  Examples of communications that would be considered improper for submission include, without limitation, customer complaints, solicitations, communications that do not relate, directly or indirectly, to our or our principal operating subsidiary's business or communications that relate to improper or irrelevant topics.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Report of the Audit Review Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Review Committee has reviewed and discussed with our management and Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Review Committee also has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2018.
The Audit Review Committee has also discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees".
The Audit Review Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the independence letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst & Young LLP's communications with the Audit Review Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Review Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors subsequently approved the recommendation) that the audited consolidated financial statements for 2018 be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.

Director Nominee Information 
[END TABLE]
It is intended that shares represented by proxies in the enclosed form will be voted for the election of the nominees named in the following table to serve as directors for a term until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected, unless contrary instructions are received.  The Board of Directors has fixed the total number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting at eleven.  All of the nominees listed below presently serve as our directors and were elected at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  If, in the judgment of the proxy holders, an unexpected occurrence should make it necessary to substitute another person for any of the nominees, shares represented by proxies will be voted for such other person as the proxy holders may select.
The disclosure below provides information as of the date of this Proxy Statement about each director nominee.  The information presented is based upon information each director has given us about his or her age, all positions held, principal occupation and business experience for the past five years, and the names of other publicly-held companies for which he/she currently serves as a director or has served as a director during the past five years.  We have also presented information regarding each nominee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board of Directors to the conclusion that he/she should serve as a director.  We believe that the nomination of each of our director nominees is in the best long-term interests of our stockholders, as each individual possesses the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values, and each nominee has the judgment, skill, independence and experience required to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.  Each individual has also demonstrated a strong commitment to service to the Company. Table of Contents

Description of Material Factors Relating to the Director Compensation Table
Each non-employee director is entitled to receive the following annual compensation for service on our Board of Directors and on HYG's Board of Directors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a retainer of $173,000 ($113,000 of which will be paid in the form of Mandatory Shares, as described below); 
• attendance fees of $1,000 per day for each meeting attended (including telephonic/telepresence meetings) of our Board of Directors or subsidiary Board of Directors (limited to $1,000 per day); 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attendance fees of $1,000 for each meeting attended (including telephonic/telepresence meetings) of a committee of our Board of Directors on which the director served; 
• an additional retainer of $7,000 for each committee of our Board of Directors on which the director served (other than the Executive Committee); 
• an additional retainer of $10,000 for each committee of our Board of Directors on which the director served as chairman (other than the Audit Review Committee); and 
• an additional retainer of $15,000 for the chairman of the Audit Review Committee of our Board of Directors. 
[END TABLE]
The retainers are paid quarterly in arrears and the meeting fees are paid following each meeting.  Each director is also reimbursed for expenses incurred as a result of attendance at meetings.  We also occasionally make a private aircraft available to directors for attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and subsidiary Board of Directors.
Under the Non-Employee Directors' Plan, each director who was not an officer of the Company or one of our subsidiaries receives $113,000 of the $173,000 retainer in whole shares of Class A Common, referred to as Mandatory Shares.  Any fractional shares are paid in cash.  The actual number of shares of Mandatory Shares issued to a director is determined by the following formula:
the dollar value of the portion of the $113,000 retainer that was earned by the director each quarter divided by the average closing price of shares of Class A Common on the NYSE for each week during such quarter.
These shares are fully vested on the date of grant, and the director is entitled to all rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote and receive dividends.  However, the shares cannot be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred by the director other than:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by will or the laws of descent and distribution; 
• pursuant to a qualifying domestic relations order; or 
• to a trust for the benefit of the director or his or her spouse, children or grandchildren. 
[END TABLE]
These restrictions lapse on the earliest to occur of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ten years after the last day of the calendar quarter for which such shares were earned; 
• the director's death or permanent disability; 
• five years from the date of the director's retirement;  
• the date that a director is both retired from our Board of Directors and has reached age 70; or 
• at such other time as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, each director may elect under the Non-Employee Directors' Plan to receive shares of Class A Common in lieu of cash, referred to as Voluntary Shares, for up to 100% of the balance of their retainers and meeting attendance fees.  The number of shares issued is determined under the same formula stated above.  However, these Voluntary Shares are not subject to the foregoing transfer restrictions.
Each director also receives (i) Company-paid life insurance in the amount of $50,000; (ii) Company-paid accidental death and dismemberment insurance for the director and spouse; (iii) personal excess liability insurance in the amount of $10 million for the director and immediate family members who reside with the director (other than Messrs. Butler and LaBarre and General Jumper) and (iv) up to $5,000 per year in matching charitable contributions. 
Director Compensation Program for 2019
The Compensation Committee periodically evaluates and recommends changes to our compensation program for directors. In 2018, the Compensation Committee used the Korn Ferry consulting firm to evaluate and provide recommendations regarding our director compensation program. Our Board of Directors adopted certain recommendations and made changes effective January 1, 2019.
The revised director compensation program is structured in a similar manner to the 2018 program. However, the retainers paid to each non-employee director for service on our Board of Directors were increased effective January 1, 2019, from $173,000 ($113,000 of which is paid in the form of Mandatory Shares) to $178,000 ($118,000 of which will be paid in the form of Mandatory Shares).

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC  Table of Contents and the NYSE.  Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by applicable regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based upon the review of the copies of Section 16(a) forms received by us, and upon written representations from reporting persons concerning the necessity of filing a Form 5 Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, we believe that, during 2018, all filing requirements applicable for reporting persons were met with the exception of Helen R. Butler and Clara R. Williams who, due to a miscommunication, each reported one gift after the Form 5 filing deadline.

Advisory Vote to Approve the Company's Named Executive Officer Compensation (Proposal 2) 
[END TABLE]
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act, and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking you to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation.
Why You Should Approve our Named Executive Officer Compensation 
The guiding principle of the compensation program for senior management employees, including Named Executive Officers, is the maintenance of a strong link between an employee's compensation, individual performance and the performance of the Company as a whole and/or the business unit for which the employee has responsibility.  The primary objectives of our compensation program are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to attract, retain and motivate talented management; 
• to reward management with competitive total compensation for the achievement of specific corporate and individual goals; and 
• to make management long-term stakeholders in the Company. 
[END TABLE]
We encourage stockholders to read the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and compensation tables, for a more detailed discussion of our compensation programs and policies.  We believe our compensation programs and policies are appropriate and effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals, and that they are aligned with stockholder interests.
We believe that stockholders should consider the following in determining whether to approve this proposal.
Compensation Program is Highly Aligned with Stockholder Value
We seek to achieve the foregoing policies and objectives through a mix of base salaries and incentive plans.  Base salaries are set at levels appropriate to allow the incentive plans to serve as significant motivating factors.  The Compensation Committee carefully reviews each of these components in relation to our performance.  Incentive-based compensation plans are designed to provide significant rewards for achieving or surpassing annual operating and financial performance objectives, as well as to align the compensation interests of the senior management employees, including the Named Executive Officers, with our long-term interests.
Strong Pay-for-Performance Orientation
The short-term and long-term incentive compensation for our employees is substantially performance-based.  Performance targets under our short-term incentive compensation plan are measured against our annual operating plan (AOP), while performance targets under our long-term incentive compensation plans are based on a longer term financial forecast.     Although the design of our compensation program offers opportunities for employees to earn truly superior compensation for outstanding results, it also includes significantly reduced compensation for results that do not meet or exceed the previously established performance targets for the year.  In years when we have weaker financial results, payouts under the incentive compensation plans will generally be lower.  In years when we have stronger financial results, payouts under the incentive compensation plans will generally be greater. In general, all performance targets are set at a scale that encourages performance improvement without requiring outstanding results that would encourage conduct inconsistent with building long term value.  The chosen performance metrics and measurement periods are well-aligned with our business strategy and objectives for long-term value creation for our stockholders.
Compensation Program Has Appropriate Long-Term Orientation
Our compensation programs and policies have a long-term focus.
The purpose of our long-term incentive compensation plans is to enable senior management employees to accumulate capital through future managerial performance, which the Compensation Committee believes contributes to the future success of our businesses.  Our long-term incentive compensation plans generally require long-term commitment on the part of our senior management employees, and cash withdrawals or stock sales are generally not permitted for a number of years.  Rather,  Table of Contents the awarded amount is effectively invested in the Company for an extended period to strengthen the tie between stockholders' and the Named Executive Officers' long-term interests.
Therefore, stockholders are asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the following resolution that will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
Stockholder Vote. In accordance with our Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our stock that are present in person or represented by proxy and that is actually voted is required to approve this proposal. You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the resolution or abstain from voting on the resolution. The result of the say-on-pay vote will not be binding on us or the Board. The final decision on the Company's executive compensation and benefits remains with the Board and the Compensation Committee. However, we and the Board value the views of our stockholders. The Board and the Compensation Committee will review the results of the vote and expect to take them into consideration in addressing future compensation policies and decisions.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC, INCLUDING THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, THE COMPENSATION TABLES AND NARRATIVE DISCUSSION.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Advisory Vote on the Frequency for Future Advisory Votes to Approve the Company's Named Executive Officer  Compensation (Proposal 3) 
[END TABLE]
As required by the Dodd Frank Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are also asking our stockholders this year to cast a non-binding advisory vote to determine whether the stockholder vote to approve the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation (or the "say-on-pay") should occur every one, two or three years.
After careful consideration, the Board has determined that holding an advisory say-on pay vote every year is the most appropriate policy for the Company at this time and recommends that stockholders vote for future advisory votes to approve the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation to occur every year. While our compensation programs are designed to promote a long-term connection between pay and performance, our Board believes that an annual say-on-pay vote allows our stockholders to provide us with immediate and direct input on our executive compensation plans and programs. 
Stockholder Vote. You may vote for future advisory votes to approve the Company's Named Executive Officer compensation to occur every one, two or three years or you may abstain from voting.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE OF ''EVERY YEAR'' FOR THE ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY FOR FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES TO APPROVE THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Approval of the Company's Non-Employee Directors' Equity Compensation Plan (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
We are asking our stockholders to approve an amended and restated Non-Employee Directors' Plan (the "Amended Directors' Plan") that was adopted by our Board on February 19, 2019. A prior version of the plan document was previously approved by stockholders in 2012 (the "Current Directors' Plan"). If approved by stockholders, the Amended Directors' Plan replaces the Current Directors' Plan. 
Our principal reason for adopting the Amended Directors' Plan is to increase the number of Class A Common shares available for issuance. The Amended Directors' Plan provides that 100,000 shares may be issued or transferred under the Amended Directors' Plan on or after May 17, 2019. 
 In approving the Amended Directors' Plan, the Board made the following material changes, along with certain other immaterial and clarifying changes, to the Current Directors' Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increase in Shares Available for Awards: Effective May 17, 2019, the number of shares of Class A Common under the Amended Directors' Plan is 100,000. For more information regarding the shares available for issuance, see "Why We Believe You Should Vote for Proposal 4" below. 
• Individual Director Annual Limit: The Amended Directors' Plan adds a limit on the number of shares that may be issued or transferred to an individual non-employee director in any calendar year under the plan. Subject to adjustment as provided in the Amended Directors' Plan, the maximum amount paid to a non-employee director in any calendar  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents year beginning on or after January 1, 2019 shall not exceed the greater of (i) $1,250,000 or (ii) the fair market value of 20,000 shares of Class A Common Stock.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pro-rated Retainer: The Amended Directors' Plan clarifies that a non-employee director's retainer paid pursuant to the Amended Directors' Plan will be pro-rated in the event the non-employee director begins or ceases service during the applicable quarter for which the retainer is paid. 
• Permitted Amendments: Stockholder approval will only be required to amend the Amended Directors' Plan where it is otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements. 
• Share Counting: The Amended Directors' Plan clarifies that, if applicable, shares withheld by the Company, tendered or otherwise used to satisfy a tax withholding obligation will count against the shares issuable under the plan. 
• Transferability: The Amended Directors' Plan provides that, in addition to a trust, Mandatory Shares (as defined below) may be transferred to a partnership for the benefit of a participant or certain members of his family. 
• Plan Term: The Amended Directors' Plan now has a limited term. No Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares may be issued under the Amended Directors' Plan on or after May 17, 2029. 
• Adjustments: The Amended Directors' Plan now allows the Compensation Committee, in connection with certain transactions or events, to provide substitute consideration for outstanding Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares. 
[END TABLE]
Why We Believe You Should Vote for Proposal 4. The Amended Directors' Plan authorizes our Board to provide quarterly retainers to our non-employee directors that are payable partly in cash and partly in Class A Common shares for the purpose of helping to align the interests of our non-employee directors with the stockholders of the Company. 
We believe our future success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate and retain high quality non-employee directors. The ability to provide equity-based awards under the Amended Directors' Plan is critical to achieving this success. We would be at a severe competitive disadvantage if we could not use share-based awards to recruit and compensate our non-employee directors. 
We also believe that equity compensation motivates non-employee directors to appropriately focus on actions that enhance stockholder value because they will share in that value enhancement through improved share price performance. Our equity compensation also helps to retain our non-employee directors and to promote a focus on sustained enhancement of stockholder value because our equity compensation awards are generally subject to lengthy transfer restrictions. 
As of February 28, 2019, 8,739 Class A Common shares, par value $1.00 per share, remained available for issuance under the Current Directors' Plan. If the Amended Directors' Plan is not approved, we may deem it necessary to increase significantly the cash component of our non-employee director compensation, which may not necessarily align compensation interests with the investment interests of our stockholders as well as alignment provided by equity-based awards. Replacing equity awards with cash also would increase cash compensation expense and use cash that could be better utilized if reinvested in our businesses or returned to our stockholders. 
The following includes (1) aggregated information regarding the dilution associated with the Current Directors' Plan and the potential stockholder dilution that would result if the proposed share increase under the Amended Directors' Plan is approved and (2) our burn rate.  As of February 28, 2019, there were 12,774,403 shares of Class A Common outstanding.
Under the terms of the Current Directors' Plan, a maximum of 100,000 shares of Class A Common (subject to adjustment as described in the Current Directors' Plan) were available to be issued as Mandatory and Voluntary Shares, of which 91,261 shares of Class A Common (0.714% of our outstanding Class A Common shares) had been issued and 8,739 shares of Class A Common remained available for issuance as of February 28, 2019. The 8,739 shares of Class A Common remaining available for issuance, a portion of which will be issued in April 2019 in connection with quarterly retainer payments, represented 0.069% of our outstanding Class A Common shares, as of February 28, 2019. Upon approval of the Amended Directors' Plan requested hereby, the maximum number of shares available for future issuance on or after the effective date as Mandatory and Voluntary Shares under the Amended Directors' Plan will again be an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Class A Common (subject to adjustments as described in the Amended Directors' Plan). This breaks down to a new share request of 91,261 shares of Class A Common. Based on the closing price on the NYSE for our Class A Common Shares on February 28, 2019 of $67.66 per share, the aggregate market value of the 100,000 shares of Class A Common that will be available for future issuance under the Amended Directors' Plan was $6,766,000. 
For 2016, 2017 and 2018, we issued Mandatory and Voluntary Shares under the Current Directors' Plan covering 17,778 shares, 16,486 shares, and 18,378 shares, respectively. Based on our basic weighted average shares of Class A Common outstanding for those three years of 12,441,529, 12,533,431 and 12,649,478, respectively, for the three-year period 2016-2018, our average burn rate was 0.140% (our individual years' burn rates were 0.143% for 2016, 0.132% for 2017, and 0.145% for 2018).
In determining the number of shares to request for approval under the Amended Directors' Plan, our management team worked with the Compensation Committee to evaluate a number of factors, including our recent share usage and the facts that  Table of Contents
(1) we perform an in-depth analysis of our Board compensation package on a triennial basis (and interim reviews at other times) and (2) non-employee directors have the option to receive their entire fees in the form of Voluntary Shares (as defined below), which would substantially increase the number of shares required under the plan. 
If the Amended Directors' Plan is approved, we intend to utilize the shares authorized under the Amended Directors' Plan to continue our practice of incentivizing directors through equity grants. We currently anticipate that the shares that will be available under the Amended Directors' Plan will last between five and seven years, based on our recent grant rates, director elections and the approximate current share price, but could last for a different period of time if actual practice does not match recent grant rates, our share price changes materially or individual directors elect to receive a higher percentage of their compensation in Voluntary Shares. Our Board would retain discretion to determine the amounts of the retainers for our non-employee directors, and future benefits that may be received by participants under the Amended Directors' Plan are not determinable at this time. 
We believe that we have demonstrated a commitment to sound equity compensation practices in recent years. We recognize that equity compensation awards dilute stockholder equity, so we have carefully managed our equity incentive compensation. Our equity compensation practices are intended to be competitive and consistent with market practices, and we believe our historical share usage has been responsible and mindful of stockholder interests, as described above.
The following summary of the other terms of the Amended Directors' Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Directors Plan attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. 
Purpose. The purpose of the Amended Directors' Plan is to provide for the payment to the non-employee directors of the Company a portion of their annual retainers in capital stock of the Company in order to help further align the interests of the directors with the stockholders of the Company and thereby help promote the long-term interests of the Company. 
Administration and Eligibility. The Amended Directors' Plan will be administered by the Board and the Compensation Committee, as applicable, as further described in the Amended Directors' Plan. The Board may alter or amend the Amended Directors' Plan or terminate it entirely. However, amendments to the Amended Directors' Plan will be subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements. Furthermore, no such action shall affect a non-employee director's rights with regard to shares that were previously issued or transferred to the director or that were earned by, but not yet issued or transferred to, the director, without the director's consent. All non-employee directors of the Company are automatically included as participants in the Plan. As of February 28, 2019, we had ten non-employee directors. The basis for participation in the Amended Directors' Plan is election or appointment as a Company non-employee director. 
Terms and Conditions. Under the Amended Directors' Plan, the directors are required to receive a portion (as determined by the Board) of their annual retainer (in 2019, $118,000 out of $178,000) in shares of Class A Common (the "Mandatory Shares"). They may also elect to receive all or part of the remainder of the retainer and all other fees in the form of shares of Class A Common (the "Voluntary Shares"). The number of shares of Class A Common issued to a director is determined by taking the dollar value of the amount to be received in Mandatory or Voluntary Shares and dividing it by the average closing price of Class A Common on the NYSE at the end of each week during each calendar quarter. The amount of any fractional shares will be paid in cash. Further, shares paid under the Amended Directors' Plan are subject to pro-ration in the event that a non-employee director begins or ceases service during the applicable calendar quarter. Shares issued under the Amended Directors' Plan may be shares of original issuance, treasury shares, or a combination of the two. 
Mandatory and Voluntary Shares are fully vested on the date of payment, and the director is entitled to ownership rights in such shares, including the right to vote and receive dividends. However, the directors are generally required to hold the Mandatory Shares for a period of ten years from the last day of the calendar quarter for which the Mandatory Shares were earned and, during that ten-year holding period, the Mandatory Shares cannot be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred except (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) in the event of divorce, subject to certain limitations as described in the Amended Directors' Plan, or (iii) to a trust or partnership for the benefit of the director or his spouse, children or grandchildren (in which case the transfer restrictions remain in effect). The transfer restrictions lapse earlier on the first to occur of (i) death or permanent disability; (ii) five years from the date of the director's retirement from the Board; (iii) the date that a director has both retired from the Board and reached age 70; or (iv) at such other time as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Voluntary Shares are not subject to such restrictions. All amounts to be settled in Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares will be paid in cash if such shares cannot be issued or transferred.
Subject to adjustment as described in the Amended Directors' Plan, the maximum amount paid to a non-employee director in any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2019 shall not exceed the greater of (i) $1,250,000 or (ii) the fair market value of 20,000 shares of Class A Common Stock.
     Adjustments. The Board will make or provide for such adjustments in the share price used to determine share payouts, in the kind of shares that may be issued or transferred under the Amended Directors' Plan, in the number of shares of Class A Common issuable in the aggregate and to individual directors under the Amended Directors' Plan, in the number of outstanding  Table of Contents
Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares for each non-employee director, and in the terms applicable to Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares, as the Board, in its sole discretion, exercised in good faith, determines is equitably required to reflect (1) any stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, recapitalization or any other change in the capital structure of the Company, (2) any merger, consolidation, spin-off, split-off, spin-out, split-up, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation or other distribution of assets or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase securities, or (3) any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing (collectively referred to as an "Extraordinary Event"). Moreover, in the event of any such Extraordinary Event, the Compensation Committee may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares such alternative consideration (including cash), if any, as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances and shall require in connection therewith the surrender of all Mandatory Shares or Voluntary Shares so replaced. 
Effective Date and Plan Term. The Amended Directors' Plan is effective May 17, 2019, subject to the approval of the Amended Directors' Plan by the stockholders of the Company as of such date. No Mandatory or Voluntary Shares may be issued or transferred under the Amended Directors' Plan on or after May 17, 2029. However, shares issued or transferred prior to the termination of the Amended Directors' Plan will generally continue to be subject to the terms of the Amended Directors' Plan following such termination. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences. This is a brief summary of certain Federal income tax consequences under the Amended Directors' Plan based on Federal income tax laws currently in effect. It is presented for the information of stockholders considering how to vote on this Proposal and not for Amended Directors' Plan participants. It is not intended to be complete and does not describe Federal taxes other than income taxes (such as Medicare or Social Security taxes), or state, local or foreign tax consequences. Generally, the recipient will be required to include as taxable ordinary income in the year of receipt of a retainer payment an amount equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any Mandatory and Voluntary Shares received. 
Registration with the SEC. We intend to file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 relating to the issuance of shares of Class A Common under the Amended Directors' Plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as soon as practicable after approval of the Amended Directors' Plan by our stockholders. 
Final 2018 Awards and Estimated 2019 Awards. Stock awards under the Current Directors' Plan for 2018 issued to the non-employee directors of the Company are shown in the Director Compensation Table on page 10. Stock awards under the Amended Directors' Plan for 2019 and thereafter are not currently determinable but will be equal to the sum of the Mandatory Shares and Voluntary Shares for each director. Since the amount of Voluntary Shares is dependent on the directors' elections and not currently determinable, the following chart shows the cash value of the Mandatory Shares for the retainer of the non-employee directors under the Amended Directors' Plan for 2019:

Confirmation of Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm of the Company, for the Current Fiscal Year (Proposal 5) 
[END TABLE]
Ernst & Young LLP has been selected by the Audit Review Committee as the principal independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year for us and certain of our subsidiaries.  The appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted to a vote of our stockholders for confirmation.  However, our Board of Directors believes that obtaining stockholder confirmation is a sound governance practice.  
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE CONFIRMATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR 2019.
 It is expected that representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will attend the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and, if a representative is in attendance, the representative will be available to answer appropriate questions.
If our stockholders fail to vote on an advisory basis in favor of the confirmation of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Review Committee will take such actions as it deems necessary as a result of such stockholder vote.  Even if the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is confirmed, the Audit Review Committee may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year 2019 if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Audit Fees
2018 and 2017  - Ernst & Young LLP billed or will bill us in the aggregate $4.7 million and $4.8 million, respectively, for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP in each of 2018 and 2017 for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as for services provided in connection with statutory audits and regulatory filings with the SEC.
Audit-Related Fees
2018 and 2017 - Ernst & Young LLP billed us in the aggregate less than $0.1 million each year for assurance and related services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP in each of 2018 and 2017, primarily related to annual subscriptions for accounting reference tools.
Tax Fees
2018 and 2017 - Ernst & Young LLP did not provide services and has not billed us fees for professional tax services in 2018 or 2017. 
All Other Fees
2018 and 2017 - Ernst & Young LLP did not provide services and has not billed us fees for services provided by Ernst & Young LLP, other than the services reported under "Audit Fees" and "Audit-Related Fees" during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Except as set forth above and approved by the Audit Review Committee pursuant to our pre-approval policies and procedures, no assurance or related services, tax compliance, tax advice or tax planning services were performed by the principal independent registered public accounting firm for us during the last two fiscal years.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Under our pre-approval policies and procedures, only audit, audit-related services and tax services may be performed by our principal independent registered public accounting firm.  All audit, audit-related, tax and other accounting services to be performed for us must be pre-approved by our Audit Review Committee.  In furtherance of this policy, for 2019, the Audit Review Committee authorized us to engage Ernst & Young LLP for specific audit, audit-related and tax services up to specified fee levels.  The Audit Review Committee has delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Review Committee, together with one other Audit Review Committee member, the authority to approve services other than audit, review or attest services, which approvals are reported to the Audit Review Committee at its next meeting.  We provide a summary of approvals and commitments at each general meeting of the Audit Review Committee.
The Audit Review Committee has considered whether the providing of the non-audit services to us by Ernst & Young LLP is compatible with maintaining its independence.  In addition, as a result of the recommendation of the Audit Review Committee, we have adopted policies limiting the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that are not audit or audit-related services.

PART THREE - EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Summary of Our Named Executive Officer Compensation Program 
[END TABLE]
The material elements of our 2018 compensation objectives and policies as they relate to the Named Executive Officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 34, referred to as the NEOs, are described below.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with all accompanying tables, footnotes and text in the Proxy Statement.  
Our executive compensation program strongly ties the compensation of our NEOs to our short-term and long-term business objectives and to stockholder interests. Key elements of compensation include base salary, annual incentive compensation, long-term incentive compensation and defined contribution retirement benefits.
[BEGIN TABLE]
At our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company received strong support for our compensation program with over 94% of the votes cast approving our advisory vote on named executive officer compensation (which vote we had conducted every three years). The Compensation Committee believes that this overwhelming support validates the philosophy and objectives of our executive compensation program. 
[END TABLE]
We pay for performance.  We align our executive compensation with corporate performance on both a short-term and long-term basis. In 2018, 81% of Mr. A. Rankin's 2018 target compensation and, as a group, approximately 66% of the other NEOs' target compensation was incentive-based and "at-risk" based on Company performance. 
In addition, the long-term awards for the NEOs were paid in the form of restricted shares of Class A Common which, as described in more detail beginning on page 28, are generally subject to transfer restrictions for a period of ten years. The value of these restricted stock awards continues to be "at-risk" based on future Company performance and continues to align the interests of the NEOs with those of our stockholders.
Other key features of our executive compensation program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
What We Do What We Do Not Do 
Equity compensation awards generally must be held for ten years. Equity awards cannot be pledged, hedged or transferred during this time. We do not provide our NEOs with employment or individual change in control agreements. 
We provide limited change in control protections under our incentive and nonqualified deferred compensation plans that (i) accelerate the time of payment of previously vested incentive benefits and non-qualified retirement benefits and (ii) provide for pro-rata target incentive payments for the year of any change in control. We do not provide any tax gross-ups except for certain relocation expenses and under one non-qualified retirement plan that was frozen in 2007. 
We provide for a modest level of perquisites, the majority of which are paid in cash, that are determined based on market reasonableness. We do not provide our NEOs with any minimum or guaranteed bonuses. 
We use an independent compensation consultant. We do not take into account our long-term awards when determining our defined contribution retirement benefits. 
We set our target compensation at the 50th percentile of our chosen benchmark group and deliver compensation above or below this level based on performance. We do not have any active defined benefit plans and only gave our NEOs credit for time worked under our frozen pension plans.

Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee receives assistance and advice from Korn Ferry, an internationally-recognized compensation consulting firm.  Korn Ferry is engaged by and reports to the Compensation Committee and also provides advice and discusses compensation issues directly with management.  
Korn Ferry makes recommendations regarding substantially all aspects of compensation for our directors and senior management employees, including the NEOs.  For 2018, Korn Ferry was engaged in general to make recommendations regarding:
• Director compensation levels;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary point levels, salary midpoints and incentive targets for all new senior management positions and/or changes to current senior management positions; 
• 2018 salary midpoints, incentive compensation targets (calculated as a percentage of salary midpoint) and target total compensation for all senior management positions; and 
• 2018 salary midpoints and/or range movement for all other employee positions. 
[END TABLE]
All salary point recommendations are determined through the consistent application of the salary point methodology, which is a proprietary method that takes into account the know-how, problem-solving and accountability requirements of the position.  A representative of Korn Ferry attended one of the Compensation Committee meetings in 2018 and, during that meeting, consulted with the Compensation Committee in executive session without management present.
Korn Ferry also provided limited non-executive compensation consulting services to the Company in 2018.  However, the Compensation Committee has considered and assessed all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) of the Exchange Act, that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to Korn Ferry.  Based on this review, we are not aware of any conflict of interest that has been raised by the work performed by Korn Ferry.  The Committee has assessed the independence of Korn Ferry.
Korn Ferry 's General Industrial Survey - Salary Midpoint
 Prior to 2018, the Compensation Committee utilized a proprietary survey known as the All Industrial survey for purposes of setting total target compensation.  The All Industrial survey contained data from a broad group of domestic industrial organizations ranging in size from under $150 million to over $5 billion in annual revenues.  As a starting point for setting total target compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee directed Korn Ferry to use a similar survey known as the General Industrial survey, which also contains data from a broad group of domestic industrial organizations, but ranging in size from approximately $500 million to approximately $1 billion in annual revenues. The make-up of the reporting companies and operating units in the General Industrial and All Industrial surveys are very similar except that the Compensation Committee directed Korn Ferry to exclude retail and finance segments from the data results.   
For 2018, participants in the General Industrial survey included 475 parent organizations and 1,108 independent operating units, which satisfied Korn Ferry's quality assurance controls and represented almost all segments of industry, including manufacturing.
The Compensation Committee chose this particular survey as its benchmark for the following reasons: Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• It provides relevant information regarding the compensation paid to employees, including senior management employees, with similar skill sets used in our industry and represents the talent pool from which we recruit. 
• The use of a broad-based survey reduces volatility and lessens the impact of cyclical upswings or downturns in any one industry that could otherwise skew the survey results in any particular year. 
• It provides a competitive framework for recruiting employees from outside of our industry. 
[END TABLE]
Using its proprietary salary point methodology, Korn Ferry compares positions of similar scope and complexity with the data contained in the General Industrial survey.  Korn Ferry then derives a median salary level for each salary point level targeted at the 50th percentile of the General Industrial survey (the "salary midpoint"). The Compensation Committee sets the salary midpoint for each of the NEOs (other than Mr. A. Rankin - refer to note (3) of the target total compensation table on page 21) at 100% of the salary midpoint recommended by Korn Ferry.  The Compensation Committee believes that the use of salary midpoints ensures that our compensation program provides sufficient compensation to attract and retain talented executives and maintain internal pay equity, without overcompensating our employees.  Because salary midpoints are based on each salary point level, all of the employees at a particular salary point level generally have the same salary midpoint, with some geographic differences.  The salary midpoints provided by Korn Ferry are then used to calculate the total target compensation of all senior management employees, including the NEOs.
Compensation Policies, Objectives and Methodology - Total Target Compensation
The guiding principle of our compensation program is the maintenance of a strong link among an employee's compensation, individual performance and the performance of the Company or the subsidiary or business unit for which the employee has responsibility.  The primary objectives of our compensation program are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain and motivate talented management; 
• reward management with competitive total compensation for achievement of specific corporate and individual goals;  
• make management long-term stakeholders in the Company;  
• help ensure that management's interests are closely aligned with those of our Company's stockholders; and 
• maintain consistency in compensation among all of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee establishes comprehensively defined "target total compensation" for each senior management employee following rigorous evaluation standards to maintain internal equity.  In this process, the Compensation Committee reviews "tally sheets" for the NEOs and other senior management employees that list each employee's title, Hay points and the following information for the current year, as well as that being proposed for the subsequent year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary midpoint, as determined by Korn Ferry from the General Industrial survey; 
• cash in lieu of perquisites (if applicable); 
• short-term incentive target dollar amount (determined by multiplying the salary midpoint by a specified percentage of that midpoint, as determined by the Compensation Committee, with advice from Korn Ferry, for each salary grade); 
• long-term incentive target dollar amount (determined in the same manner as the short-term incentive target); 
• target total compensation, which is the sum of the foregoing amounts; and 
• base salary.  
[END TABLE]
In November 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the tally sheets for each of our NEOs to decide whether it should make changes to the 2018 compensation program.  The Compensation Committee determined that the overall program continued to be consistent with our compensation objectives and did not make any material changes for 2018.     
The design of our compensation program provides employees with the opportunity to earn superior compensation for outstanding results.  Base salaries are set at levels appropriate to allow our incentive plans to serve as significant motivating factors.  Because our program provides significantly reduced compensation for results that do not meet or exceed the established performance targets for the year, it encourages NEOs to earn incentive pay greater than 100% of target over time by delivering outstanding managerial performance.
  The Compensation Committee views the various components of compensation as related but distinct. For example, the Compensation Committee uses the information provided from the General Industrial survey to determine the salary midpoint.  It then generally sets actual base salaries between 80% and 120% of that salary midpoint (up to 130% for Mr. A. Rankin).  The Compensation Committee also obtains the total target incentive compensation amounts from Korn Ferry based on the General  Table of Contents
Industrial survey, but determines the mix of short-term and long-term incentives in its discretion, based on its decision regarding how best to motivate our employees.
The following table sets forth target total compensation for the NEOs, as recommended by Korn Ferry and approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018:

The Compensation Committee fixes an annual base salary intended to be competitive in the marketplace to recruit and retain talented employees.  Base salary is intended to provide employees with a set amount of money during the year with the expectation that they will perform their responsibilities to the best of their ability and in our best interests.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the base salary for the NEOs by taking into account their individual performance for 2017 and the relationship of their 2017 base salary to the new 2018 salary midpoint for their Hay point level.  The Compensation Committee also took into account other relevant information, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• general inflation, salary trends and economic forecasts provided by Korn Ferry; 
• general budget considerations and business forecasts provided by management; and 
• any extraordinary personal accomplishments or corporate events that occurred during 2017. 
[END TABLE]
The potential for larger salary increases exists for employees with lower base salaries relative to their salary midpoint and/or superior performance.  The potential for smaller increases or even no increase exists for those employees with higher base salaries relative to their salary midpoint and/or who have performed less effectively during the performance period.

Incentive Compensation
One of the principles of our compensation program is that senior management employees, including the NEOs, are compensated based on the performance of the Company and/or the business unit for which they are responsible. In 2018, all of the NEOs participated in (i) the Hyster-Yale Group, Inc. Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Short-Term Plan") and (ii) the Equity Long-Term Plan.
Overview.   Our incentive compensation plans are designed to align the compensation interests of the senior management employees with our short-term and long-term interests.  A significant portion of the NEOs' compensation is linked directly to the attainment of specific financial and operating targets.  The Compensation Committee believes that a material percentage of the NEOs' compensation should be contingent on the performance of the Company and/or the business unit for which they are responsible.  As illustrated on the target total compensation table on page 21, 81% of Mr. A. Rankin's 2018 target compensation was variable or "at risk" and tied to Company performance and, as a group, approximately 66% of the other NEOs' target compensation was tied to Company performance.  For 2018, the sum of each of the NEO's incentive compensation targets exceeded the sum of his fixed payments (base salary plus perquisite allowance).    
The performance criteria and target performance levels for the incentive plans are established annually by the Compensation Committee and are based upon management's recommendations as to our performance objectives for the year.  Three types of performance targets are used in the incentive compensation plans:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets Based on Annual Operating Plan. Certain performance targets are based on forecasts contained in the 2018 annual operating plan ("AOP"). With respect to these targets, there is an expectation that these performance targets will be met during the year. If they are not, the participants will not receive all or a portion of the award that is based on these performance criteria. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets Based on Long-Term Goals. Other performance targets are not based on the 2018 AOP. Rather, they are based on long-term goals established by the Compensation Committee. Because these targets are not based on the AOP, it is possible in any given year that the level of expected performance may be above or below the specified performance target for that year. Certain operating profit percent targets are examples of targets that are based on long-term goals (see "Long-Term Incentive Compensation" beginning on page 28). 
• Operating Profit Percent Over-Ride.  The Compensation Committee approved an operating profit percent "over-ride" feature to each of the Short-Term Plan, the Equity Long-Term Plan and the Hyster-Yale Group, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Cash Long-Term Plan" ) (collectively, the "Incentive Plans") for 2018.  This feature provides for a reduction in payouts under the plans from the amounts otherwise determined under the pre-established performance targets unless a separate operating profit percent target is achieved, thus providing participants with additional motivation to deliver outstanding performance.  
[END TABLE]
Each NEO is eligible to receive a short-term incentive award and a long-term incentive award based on a target incentive amount that is equal to a percentage of salary midpoint. However, the final payout may be higher or lower than the targeted amount.
Calculation and Payment Overview.   Awards under the Incentive Plans are determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target awards for each executive are equal to a specified percentage of the executive's 2018 salary midpoint, based on the number of salary points assigned to the position and the appropriate level of short-term and long-term incentive compensation targets recommended by Korn Ferry and adopted by the Compensation Committee at that level.  The Compensation Committee then increases the target amounts under the Equity Long-Term Plan by 15% to account for the immediately taxable nature of the awards. 
• The plans have a one-year performance period. 
• Final awards are determined after year-end by comparing actual performance to the pre-established performance targets that were set by the Compensation Committee. 
• The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may increase, decrease or eliminate awards and may approve the payment of awards where performance would otherwise not meet the minimum criteria set for payment of awards, although it rarely does so.  
• Short-Term Plan awards are paid annually in cash. Equity Long-Term Plan awards are paid annually in a combination of cash and restricted shares of Class A Common. Cash Long-Term Plan awards are paid in cash on the third anniversary of the grant date of the award. 
• All awards are immediately vested when granted. Note, however, that the transfer restrictions on awards under our Equity Long-Term Plan provide participants with an incentive over the ten-year restricted period to increase the value of the Company, which is expected to be reflected in the increased value of the stock awarded.  The Compensation Committee believes that this encourages our executives to maintain a long-term focus on our profitability, which is in the Company's best interests. 
• Refer to "Employment and Severance Agreements" on page 32 for a description of the impact of a change in control on Incentive Plan awards. 
[END TABLE]
Incentive Compensation Tables.   When reviewing the incentive compensation tables beginning below, the following factors should be considered:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Selection of Performance Factors and Targets.  The Compensation Committee considered the factors described under "Incentive Compensation - Overview" beginning on page 22 and adopted performance criteria and target performance levels to determine the 2018 incentive compensation awards.   
• Adjustments  In calculating the various 2018 incentive compensation performance targets and results, adjustments were made for certain non-recurring or special items (similar to the adjustments listed for the ROTCE calculation on page 25). These adjustments were established by the Compensation Committee at the time the targets were set. In particular, the Compensation Committee approved an exclusion from the calculation of 2018 incentive compensation for the after tax cost of any law or regulation change (in excess of the amount included in the AOP, if any).  During 2018, the U.S. Government enacted tariffs on (i) steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Code and (ii) certain goods imported from China, including forklift trucks and components, under Section 301 of the Code (the "Tariffs").  Although the Company implemented price increases and a tariff surcharge to offset the material cost inflation driven by the Tariffs, the Company's 2018 full-year operating results suffered due to a lag in time between full realization of the price increases/surcharge and when the Tariffs and material cost increases were first realized.  The Compensation Committee determined that the Tariffs were the result of "law or regulation  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents change" within the meaning of the previously-approved adjustment and that they should not adversely affect 2018 incentive compensation payments as they were not within the control of the 2018 Incentive Plan participants. Accordingly, the ROTCE and operating profit targets and results disclosed on the tables for the Short-Term Plan and the Long-Term Plan have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the Tariffs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement Percentages.  The achievement percentages are otherwise based on the formulas contained in performance guidelines adopted by the Compensation Committee.  The formulas do not provide for straight-line interpolation from the performance target to the maximum payment target.   
• Market Share Performance Factors.  These tables do not disclose our market share targets or results due to the competitively sensitive nature of that information. The market share targets under the Short-Term Plan were based on our expected 2018 AOP results, while the market share targets under the Equity Long-Term Plan were based on a combination of the Company's current market position and long-term strategic objectives. The Compensation Committee believed that, with strong management performance, it was reasonably possible for the Company to meet all market share targets in 2018. 
• Operating Profit Percent Over-Ride.  The Compensation Committee approved the addition of an operating profit percent "over-ride" feature to each of the Incentive Plans for 2018.  This feature provides for a reduction in payouts under the plans of up to 40% from the amounts otherwise determined under the pre-established performance targets unless a separate operating profit percent target of 4.0% is achieved, thus providing participants with additional motivation to deliver outstanding performance. Because the Company achieved 3.8% adjusted operating profit percent for 2018 (less than the 4.0% target), the payout percentage for participants under each of the Incentive Plans was reduced to 97.0% of the initial payout percentage in accordance with the 2018 operating profit percent over-ride feature. 
• Nuvera Fuel Cells, LLC ("Nuvera") Performance Goals. For 2018, the Short-Term Plan awards for certain of the NEOs were based in part on specific Nuvera-related performance criteria. These tables do not disclose certain confidential commercial and financial Nuvera performance targets or results due to the competitively sensitive nature of that information. The Compensation Committee believed that, with strong management performance, it was reasonably possible for the Company to meet all Nuvera performance targets in 2018. 
• Bolzoni SpA ("Bolzoni") Performance Goals. For 2018, the Short-Term Plan awards for certain of the NEOs were based in part on specific Bolzoni-related performance criteria, as described in the following tables.

ROTCE.  In 2018, ROTCE targets were used to determine final payouts for participants under the Short-Term Plan based on a pre-established formula. 
ROTCE is calculated as follows:
Earnings Before Interest After-Tax after adjustments divided by 
Total Capital Employed after adjustments
Earnings Before Interest After-Tax is equal to the sum of interest expense, net of interest income, less 26% for taxes, plus net income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders, which we refer to as net income. Total Capital Employed is equal to (i) the sum of the average debt and average stockholders' equity less (ii) average consolidated cash. Average debt, stockholders' equity and consolidated cash are calculated by taking the sum of the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of each of the next 12 months divided by 13.    
Consolidated ROTCE is calculated from the financial statements using average debt, average stockholders' equity and average cash based on the sum of the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of each quarter divided by five, which is then adjusted for any non-recurring or special items:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Net income $34.7 
Plus: 2018 Interest expense, net 13.6 
Less: Income taxes on 2018 interest expense, net at 26% (3.5) 
Earnings Before Interest After-Tax $44.8 
2018 Average stockholders' equity (12/31/2017 and each of 2018's quarter ends) $561.7 
2018 Average debt (12/31/2017 and each of 2018's quarter ends) 289.0 
Less: 2018 Average cash (12/31/2017 and each of 2018's quarter ends) (161.2) 
Total Capital Employed $689.5 
Consolidated ROTCE (Before Adjustments) 6.5% 
Plus: Adjustments to Earnings Before Interest After-Tax $51.8 
Less: Adjustments to Total Capital Employed $(213.5) 
Adjusted Consolidated ROTCE 20.3% 
[END TABLE]
Adjustments to the ROTCE calculation under the Short-Term Plan are non-recurring or special items that are generally established by the Compensation Committee at the time the ROTCE targets are set.  During 2018, the anticipated and actual results of Nuvera, the Americas Fuel Cell division and Bolzoni were excluded from the ROTCE target and Adjusted Consolidated ROTCE. In addition, for 2018, the ROTCE adjustments generally related to the after-tax impact of the following items only if they were in excess of the amounts included in the 2018 AOP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in any law or regulation, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Tariffs (see "Incentive Compensation Tables" on page 23 for a more detailed explanation of the adjustment for Tariffs); 
• acquisition-related expenses; and 
• the post-acquisition impact of business acquisitions. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that these items should not adversely affect incentive compensation payments, as they were incurred in connection with actions or events that were beneficial to us, such as improving our operations, or were generally not within the employees' control and, as a result, these items should not adversely affect incentive compensation payments.
The following tables show detailed calculations of the performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee for 2018 under the Short-Term Plan to determine final incentive compensation payments for the NEOs.

For 2018, approximately 65% of the Equity Long-Term Plan awards for the NEOs was distributed in shares of restricted stock, with the remaining 35% being distributed in cash to initially approximate the income tax withholding obligations for the stock. In addition, at the time the stock awards were issued, an NEO automatically surrenders a portion of his shares to the Company to pay for additional tax withholding obligations associated with the award, if necessary. The actual number of shares of stock issued to a participant is determined by taking the dollar value of the stock component of the award and dividing it by a formula share price.  For this purpose, the formula share price is calculated as the lesser of:  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the average closing price of our Class A Common stock on the NYSE at the end of each week during the 2017 calendar year (or such other previous calendar year as determined by the Compensation Committee); or 
• the average closing price of our Class A Common stock on the NYSE at the end of each week during the 2018 performance period. 
[END TABLE]
Participants have all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote, upon receipt of the shares.  The participants also have the right to receive dividends that are declared and paid after they receive the award shares.  The full amount of the award, including the fair market value of the award shares on the date of grant, is fully taxable to the participant.  The award shares that are issued are subject to transfer restrictions that generally lapse on the earliest to occur of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ten years after the last day of the performance period; 
• the participant's death or permanent disability; or 
• five years (or earlier with the approval of the Compensation Committee) from the date of retirement. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has the right to release the restrictions at an earlier date, but rarely does so for circumstances other than: (i) the purchase of a principal residence for the participant; (ii) payment of medical expenses for the participant, his or her spouse or his or her dependents; or (iii) payment of expenses for the education of the participant, his or her spouse or his or her dependents within the next 18 months.    
For 2018, the Long-Term Incentive Plans were designed to provide target long-term incentive compensation to the NEOs of between 70% and 290% of midpoint, depending on the NEO's position.  The table below shows the long-term target awards (including a 15% increase in target percentages to reflect the immediately taxable nature of the equity awards) and payouts under the Long-Term Incentive Plans approved by the Compensation Committee for each NEO for 2018:

Other Compensation of Named Executive Officers
Discretionary Cash Bonuses.  The Compensation Committee has the authority to grant, and has from time to time granted, discretionary cash bonuses to our employees, including the NEOs, in addition to the Incentive Plan compensation described above.  The Compensation Committee uses discretionary cash bonuses to reward substantial achievement or superior service to the Company and/or its subsidiaries, particularly when such achievement or service is not reflected in the performance criteria established under our Incentive Plans.  No discretionary cash bonuses were awarded to the NEOs for 2018 performance.
Retirement Plans.  The material terms of our retirement plans are described in the narratives following the Pension Benefits Table and the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
Defined Benefit Pension Plans.  The NEOs do not currently accrue any defined benefit pension benefits.  Mr. Wilson is entitled to receive payments from a frozen pension plan as indicated in the Pension Benefits Table on page 40.
Defined Contribution Plans.  We provide the NEOs and most other full-time employees with defined contribution retirement benefits.  Employer contributions are calculated under formulas that are designed to provide employees with competitive retirement income.  The Compensation Committee believes that the target level of retirement benefits gives us the ability to attract and retain talented management employees at the senior executive level and below.
 In general, the NEOs and other executive officers receive the same retirement benefits as all other similarly-situated employees.  However, (i) certain retirement benefits that are provided to Messrs. A. Rankin and Wilson exceed the benefits that are provided to other employees and (ii) the benefits that are provided to the NEOs and other executive officers in the U.S. are provided under a combination of tax-favored and Excess Plans, while the benefits that are provided to other employees are provided generally only under tax-favored plans.  The Excess Plans provide the U.S. employees with the retirement benefits that would have been provided under the tax-favored plans, but that cannot be provided due to various Internal Revenue Service regulations, limits and non-discrimination requirements. 
Our defined contribution plans contain the following three types of benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employee deferrals; 
• matching (or substitute matching) employer contributions; and 
• profit sharing benefits. 
[END TABLE]
The "compensation" that is taken into account under these plans generally includes base salary and Short-Term Plan payments, but excludes most other forms of compensation, including long-term incentive compensation and other discretionary payments.  The NEOs other than Mr. A. Rankin may elect to defer up to 25% of compensation. Mr. A. Rankin no longer defers any compensation under the defined contribution plans. 
Under the matching portion of the defined contribution plans for 2018, the NEOs received employer matching contributions in accordance with the following formulas:
• Mr. A. Rankin:  an automatic 3% employer contribution; and
• Messrs. Schilling, Wilson, Pascarelli and Prasad:  a 3% match on the first 6% of contributions to the plans.
Under the profit sharing portion of the plans, eligible employees receive a profit sharing contribution equal to a specified percentage of compensation that varies depending on the employee's age, compensation and our operating profit percent performance for the year.  If the Company performs well, the amount of the profit sharing contribution increases.  The range of profit sharing contributions for the NEOs in 2018 was: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. A. Rankin and Wilson: between 4.50% and 14.90% of compensation; and 
• Messrs. Schilling, Pascarelli and Prasad: between 3.80% and 12.25% of compensation. 
[END TABLE]
The NEOs are all 100% vested in their retirement benefits. Benefits under the tax-favored plans are payable at any time following a termination of employment.  Participants have the right to invest their account balances among various investment options that are offered by the plans' trustees.  Participants can elect various forms of payment including lump sum distributions and installments.
Under the Excess Plans:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participants' account balances, other than excess profit sharing benefits, are credited with earnings during the year based on the rate of return of the Vanguard Retirement Savings Trust fixed income fund, which is one of the investment funds under the U.S. qualified defined contribution plan, with a 14% maximum per year;   
• no interest is credited on excess profit sharing benefits; 
• the amounts credited under the Excess Plans each year are paid prior to March 15th of the following year to avoid regulatory complexities and eliminate the risk of non-payment to the executives based on the unfunded nature of the Excess Plans; and 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amounts credited under the Excess Plans each year are increased by 15% to reflect the immediately taxable nature of the payments.  The 15% increase applies to all benefits other than interest and the portion of the employee deferrals that are in excess of the amount needed to obtain a full employer matching contribution. 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Wilson maintains an account under the HYG Unfunded Benefit Plan (the "Frozen Unfunded Plan") that was frozen effective December 31, 2007.  His frozen account is subject to the following rules:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The frozen account is credited with interest each year.  For 2018, interest on Mr. Wilson's account is credited at the rate of 2% during the year.  His account is then credited with additional interest credits after year-end based on a formula that takes into account the final payout percentage under the Cash Long-Term Plan for the year, with a maximum of 14%.  
• The amount of the annual interest credits, increased by 15% to reflect the immediately taxable nature of the payments, is paid prior to March 15th of the following year. 
• The frozen account (including unpaid interest for the year of payment, if any) will be paid at the earlier of termination of employment (subject to a six-month delay if required under Section 409A of the Code) or a change in control. 
• Upon payment of the frozen account, a determination will be made whether the highest incremental state and federal personal income tax rates in the year of payment exceed the rates that were in effect in 2008 when all other participants received their payments from the Frozen Unfunded Plan.  In the event the rates have increased, an additional tax gross-up payment will be paid to Mr. Wilson.  The Compensation Committee determined that we, and not the executive, should bear the risk of a tax increase after 2008 because Mr. Wilson would have received payment of his frozen account in 2008 were it not for the adverse cash flow and income tax impact on us.  No other tax gross-ups (such as gross-ups for excise or other taxes) will be paid. 
[END TABLE]
Other Benefits.  All salaried U.S. employees, including the NEOs, participate in a variety of health and welfare benefit plans that are designed to enable us to attract and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits.  Although we provide limited perquisites and other personal benefits to certain executives (mostly outside the U.S.), we do not believe these perquisites and other personal benefits constitute a material component of the executive officer's compensation package. See note (5) to the Summary Compensation Table on page 34.
Employment and Severance Agreements. Consistent with our general severance arrangement, upon an NEO's termination of employment with us for any reason, the NEO is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amounts or benefits earned or accrued during their term of employment, including earned but unpaid salary and accrued but unused vacation pay; and 
• benefits that are provided in accordance with the terms of the retirement plans, the Incentive Plans, the Excess Plans and the Frozen Unfunded Plan at termination of employment that are further described in this Proxy Statement. 
[END TABLE]
     There are no individual severance contracts with any of the NEOs. Upon termination of employment in certain circumstances and in accordance with the terms of a broad-based severance plan that applies to all U.S. employees, the NEOs are only entitled to severance pay and continuation of certain health benefits for a stated period of time based on length of service.
The terms and conditions of the employment of our executives outside the United States are generally defined in written agreements that cannot be revised without the consent of both the employer and the executive.  Any additional compensation or benefits would be the subject of negotiation.
Limited Change in Control Benefits.  In order to advance the compensation objective of attracting, retaining and motivating qualified management, the Compensation Committee believes that it is appropriate to provide limited change in control protections to the NEOs and other employees.  The accrued account balances under the Cash Long-Term Plan, the Excess Plans and the Frozen Unfunded Plan will automatically be paid in the form of a lump sum payment in the event of a change in control of the Company or the participant's employer.  A pro-rata target award under the current year's Incentive Plans will also be paid in the event of a change in control.  The Compensation Committee believes that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The change in control payment triggers are appropriate due to the unfunded nature of the benefits provided under these plans; 
• The skills, experience and services of our key management employees are a strong factor in our success and that the occurrence of a change in control transaction would create uncertainty for these employees; and 
• Some key management employees would consider terminating employment in order to trigger the payment of their unfunded benefits if an immediate payment is not made when a change in control occurs.   
[END TABLE]
Our change in control payment triggers are designed to encourage key management employees to remain employed during and after a change in control. Table of Contents
The change in control payment trigger under the Excess Plans and the Frozen Unfunded Plan does not increase the amount of the benefits payable under those plans.  Participants will only receive their accrued account balance (including interest) as of the date of the change in control.  However, the change in control provisions under our Incentive Plans, in addition to providing for the immediate payment of the account balance (plus interest) under the Cash Long-Term Plan as of the date of the change in control (if any), also provide for the payment of a pro-rated award target for the year of the change in control.
Importantly, these change in control provisions are not employment agreements and do not guarantee employment for any of the executives for any period of time.  In addition, none of the payments under any plan will be "grossed up" for any excise taxes imposed on the executives as a result of the receipt of payments upon a change in control.
For a further discussion of the potential payments that may be made to the NEOs in connection with a change in control, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination/Change in Control" beginning on page 37.    
Tax and Accounting Implications
Deductibility of Executive Compensation.  Code Section 162(m) provides that, subject to certain exceptions, we may not deduct compensation of more than $1 million that is paid to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers). Historically, compensation that qualifies as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) could be excluded from this $1 million limit, but this exception has now been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless certain transition relief for certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 is available. For 2018, we do not expect that payouts under our Incentive Plans will qualify for transition relief or will otherwise be excludable from the $1 million cap that Code Section 162(m) imposes for purposes of federal income tax deductibility.  
While the Compensation Committee may consider in very general terms the deductibility of the compensation it awards, the Committee retains the flexibility to award compensation that is consistent with our objectives and philosophy even if it does not qualify for a tax deduction. The Compensation Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise our ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain the executive talent to compete successfully. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.  We account for stock-based payments in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718.  Based on FASB ASC Topic 718, the grant date of the awards under the Equity Long-Term Plan for this purpose is the date on which the award shares are issued, which occurs in the year following the year in which the shares are earned.  See Note 6 of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information regarding accounting treatment of our equity awards.
Other Policies and Considerations
Assessment of Risks in our Compensation Program.  As part of its oversight, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of the Company's compensation program on the Company's risk profile.  The Committee directed management to annually undertake a detailed risk assessment of our compensation programs.  Each year, management, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, reviews our pay practices and incentive programs to identify any potential risks to the Company.  Our pay philosophy: provides an effective balance of base salary and incentive compensation; short and long-term performance measures; financial and non-financial performance measures and allows for the use of Compensation Committee discretion.  Further, the Company has: policies to mitigate compensation-related risk including lengthy holding periods for long-term awards; stated payment caps; insider-trading prohibitions and independent Compensation Committee oversight.  The Compensation Committee agreed with the findings of management's assessment for 2018 that (1) our compensation programs are effectively designed to help mitigate conduct that is inconsistent with building long-term value of the Company and (2) the risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
Stock Ownership Guidelines.  While the Company encourages the executive officers to own shares of Class A Common, it does not have any formal policy requiring the executive officers to own any specified amount of Class A Common.  However, the shares of Class A Common granted under the Equity Long-Term Plan generally must be held for a period of ten years which can result in the executive officers being required to hold a significant accumulation of Class A Common during their careers. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions.  Our management, in particular the CEO of the Company and the CEO of HYG, reviews our goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers.  The CEO of HYG annually reviews the performance of each executive officer (other than the CEO of HYG whose performance is reviewed by the CEO of the Company, and the CEO of the Company, whose performance is reviewed by the Compensation Committee) and makes recommendations based on these reviews, including with respect to salary adjustments and incentive compensation award amounts, to the Compensation Committee.  In addition to the CEO recommendations, the Compensation Committee considers recommendations made by Korn Ferry, our independent outside compensation consultant, which bases its recommendations upon an analysis of similar positions at a broad range of domestic industries, as well as an understanding of our policies and objectives, as described above.  The Compensation Committee can exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended adjustments or  Table of Contents awards to executive officers.  After considering these recommendations, the Compensation Committee determines the base salary and incentive compensation levels for the executive officers, including each NEO, and any additional discretionary payments.
Executive Compensation Program for 2019 and Impact of "Say on Pay" Stockholder Vote
When setting executive compensation for 2019, the Compensation Committee took into account the results of the stockholder advisory vote on named executive officer compensation that occurred at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders.  Stockholders who cast votes overwhelmingly (94%) approved the compensation of our named executive officers described in our 2016 proxy statement.

Description of Material Factors Relating to the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table
The compensation of the NEOs consists of the following components: base salary (which includes the perquisite allowance for U.S. executives), short-term cash incentives and long-term equity and non-equity incentives.  All of the NEOs also receive various retirement benefits.  Each of these components is described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" which begins on page 18.  Additional details of certain components are provided below. Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Equity Compensation 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the NEOs participated in the Equity Long-Term Plan.  All U.S. employees are also eligible to receive discretionary equity awards under the Supplemental Equity Plan.  All awards are based on one-year performance periods and are immediately vested and paid when approved by the Compensation Committee.  Therefore, no equity awards remain outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Awards under the Equity Long-Term Plan are paid partially in cash and partially in the form of fully vested shares of restricted stock.  While the stock is fully vested at the time of grant, it is subject to transfer restrictions generally for a period of ten years from the date of grant.  The transfer restrictions provide participants with an incentive to increase the value of the Company over the ten-year restricted period, which is expected to be reflected in the increased value of the stock. Refer to "Long-Term Incentive Compensation" beginning on page 28 and note (4) of the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table beginning on page 35 for additional information regarding our equity awards.  The following table reflects the stock awards issued under the Equity Long-Term Plan for 2018 performance.  No stock awards have been issued under the Supplemental Equity Plan.

Potential Payments Upon Termination/Change in Control 
[END TABLE]
The following change in control provisions are contained in the Incentive Plans, Excess Plans and Frozen Unfunded Plan:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the account balances as of the date of the change in control in the Cash Long-Term Plan, the Excess Plans and the Frozen Unfunded Plan will automatically be paid in the form of a lump sum payment in the event of a change in control of the Company or the participant's employer; and 
• the change in control provisions under our Incentive Plans, in addition to providing for the immediate payment of the account balance (plus interest) as of the date of the change in control, also provide for the payment of a pro-rated target award for the year of the change in control. 
[END TABLE]
A "change in control" for purposes of these plans generally consists of any of the following provided that the event otherwise qualifies as a change in control under the regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code:  
(1) An acquisition of more than 50% of the voting securities of the Company or the voting securities of the subsidiary (for those employees of that particular subsidiary) other than acquisitions directly from the Company or the subsidiary, as applicable, involving:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any employee benefit plan; 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company; 
• the applicable subsidiary or one of its affiliates; or 
• the parties to the stockholders' agreement discussed under "Amount and Nature of Beneficial Ownership - Class B Common Stock" on page 45; 
[END TABLE]
(2) The members of the Company's current Board of Directors (and their approved successors) ceasing to constitute a majority of the Company's Board of Directors or, if applicable, the board of directors of a successor of the Company;
(3) For those plans that cover the employees of a subsidiary, the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and its affiliates, excluding a business combination pursuant to which the individuals and entities who beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the applicable entity immediately prior to such business combination continue to hold at least 50% of the voting securities of the successor;
(4) For all plans, the consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of assets of another corporation, or other transaction involving the Company excluding, however, a business combination pursuant to which both of the following apply:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the individuals and entities who beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company immediately prior to such business combination continue to hold at least 50% of the voting securities of the successor; and 
• at the time of the execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company providing for such business combination, at least a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company were incumbent directors. 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of calculating the amount of any potential payments to the NEOs under the table provided below, we have assumed that a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018.  We believe that the remaining assumptions listed below, which are necessary to produce these estimates, are reasonable individually and in the aggregate.  However, there can be no assurance that a change in control would produce the same or similar results as those described if it occurs on any other date or if any assumption is not correct in fact.

(1) This column reflects the award targets for the NEOs under the Incentive Plans for 2018.  Under the change in control provisions of the plans, they would have been entitled to receive their award targets for 2018 if a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018.  Awards under the Equity Long-Term Plan are denominated in dollars and the amounts shown in the above table reflect the dollar-denominated 2018 target awards (including the 15% increase to reflect the immediately taxable nature of the award).  As described in note (4) to the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, the NEOs would receive approximately 35% of the value of the award in cash, and the remainder in shares of restricted stock.   
(2) This column reflects the account balances of the NEOs as of December 31, 2018 under the Excess Plans and the Frozen Unfunded Plan (for Mr. Wilson). Under the change in control provisions of those plans, the NEOs would have been entitled to receive payment of their entire account balances if a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018.  No additional amounts are paid due to a change in control.  The majority of the amount shown for Mr. Wilson is 100% vested and was earned for services performed in years prior to 2018.  Only a small portion of his account balance represents benefits earned for services performed in 2018.  Each of these plans are discussed in more detail under "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Benefits" below.

[END TABLE]
Refer to "Retirement Plans" on page 31 for a detailed discussion of the terms of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans.  The following is a summary of special rules that apply under each plan that are not otherwise described therein.
Executive Excess Plan:  In addition to the substitute matching and profit sharing benefits previously described, Mr. A. Rankin also annually receives a benefit of $37,710 credited to his account under the Executive Excess Plan.
Frozen Unfunded Plan:  From January 1, 2000 through May 31, 2000, Mr. Wilson was not eligible to participate in our tax-favored defined contribution plan. Instead, he deferred a portion of his salary and bonus under the Frozen Unfunded Plan. When he became a participant in the U.S. qualified defined contribution plan, these additional deferrals ceased.
Cash Long-Term Plan:  The awards granted under the Cash Long-Term Plan are subject to the following rules:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The awards are immediately vested as of the grant date of the award (which is the January 1st following the end of the performance period). 
• Once granted, awards are not subject to any forfeiture or risk of forfeiture.  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards approved by the Compensation Committee for a calendar year are credited to separate sub-accounts established for each participant for each award year.  During 2018, the sub-accounts were credited with 2% interest during the year.  If a participant remained actively employed through 2018, additional interest was credited based on the chart that converted the payout factor under the Cash Long-Term Plan to a specified interest rate, with a maximum of 14% maximum per year.   
• Each sub-account is paid at the earliest of death, disability, retirement, change in control or on the third anniversary of the grant date of the award.

(2) For Mr. Wilson, the number of years of credited service taken into account to determine pension benefits under the UK Plan was frozen as of May 31, 1995. 
[END TABLE]
Description of Pension Plans
Messrs. A. Rankin, Schilling, Pascarelli and Prasad do not participate in any of our pension plans.  Mr. Wilson is entitled to receive frozen pension benefits that are 100% vested.
The amounts shown above were determined as of December 31, 2018, which is the measurement date for pension benefits that is used in our financial statements.  In determining the present value of the pension benefits under the UK Plan, a discount rate of 2.65% and an assumed retirement age of 65 with no pre-retirement decrement was used.  The following additional material assumptions were used in the calculations:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the UK Plan, the SAPS series mortality table, year of use 2018, with a 1.25 multiplier and an annual cost-of-living adjustment of 2.00% (in-payment). 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Wilson was a participant in the UK Plan for periods prior to May 31, 1995.  His pension benefits in the UK Plan are generally computed under the following formula: 1/45th of "final average pay" multiplied by years of credited service before June 30, 2004 plus 1/60th of "final average pay" multiplied by years of credited service after June 30, 2004.  For computing pension benefits under the UK Plan, "final average pay" is based on the highest annual average of pay in any period of three consecutive years in the ten years immediately preceding May 31, 1995 for Mr. Wilson.  For purposes of the UK Plan, "pay" is generally a participant's annual salary excluding bonuses, commissions, overtime payments and shift allowances less a U.K. based national insurance contributions deduction. Mr. Wilson is eligible for unreduced early retirement benefits under the UK Plan. Pension payments are paid in the form of a monthly annuity with survivorship protection.
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
 As was permitted under applicable SEC rules, to determine our median employee last year, we chose "base salary" for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017 as our consistently applied compensation measure.  For salaried employees, we estimated annual base salary using salary grade midpoints.  For labor grade employees, we estimated annual base salary using labor grade wage rates and reasonable estimates of hours worked in a given year. Using a determination date of October 1, 2017, a valid statistical sampling methodology was used to estimate the median base salary for 6,695 employees.  This number did not exclude any non-U.S. employees, although such exclusion would have been permitted  Table of Contents under applicable SEC rules. We then produced a sample of employees who were paid within a 10% range of the median and selected an employee from within that group as our median employee.
For purposes of this year's disclosure, we did not go through this process again, as we have determined that there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure.  As a result under SEC rules, we are allowed to again use last year's median employee for purposes of this year's pay ratio calculation and disclosure.  However, due to the departure of last year's median employee during 2018, we have selected a different median employee from the group identified last year to serve as this year's median employee.  This year's median employee was the very next employee listed below last year's median employee in the sample group of employees produced by last year's analysis and process.
We determined that this year's median employee's annual total compensation was $52,012 (determined in accordance with the requirements for the 2018 Summary Compensation Table), and that our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 was $4,469,254 (the same amount as provided for him in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table). Our estimate of the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to this year's median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 is 86:1. We note that, due to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this pay ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions described above.

BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF CLASS A COMMON AND CLASS B COMMON 
[END TABLE]
Set forth in the following tables is information as of March 1, 2019 (except as otherwise indicated) with respect to (1) each person who is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Class A Common, (2) each person who is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Class B Common and (3) the beneficial ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common by our directors, NEOs and all of our executive officers and directors as a group.  Beneficial ownership of Class A Common and Class B Common has been determined for this purpose in accordance with Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.  Accordingly, the amounts shown in the tables do not purport to represent beneficial ownership for any purpose other than compliance with SEC reporting requirements.  Further, beneficial ownership as determined in this manner does not necessarily bear on the economic incidence of ownership of Class A Common or Class B Common.
Holders of shares of Class A Common and Class B Common are entitled to different voting rights with respect to each class of stock.  Each share of Class A Common is entitled to one vote per share.  Each share of Class B Common is entitled to ten votes per share.  Holders of Class A Common and holders of Class B Common generally vote together as a single class on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.  Shares of Class B Common are convertible into shares of Class A Common on a one-for-one basis, without cost, at any time at the option of the holder of the Class B Common. Table of Contents

The shares each non-employee director has the right to receive are not included in the table because the actual number of additional shares will be determined on April 1, 2019 by taking the amount of such director's quarterly retainer required to be paid in shares of Class A Common plus any voluntary portion of such director's quarterly retainer, if so elected, divided by the average of the closing price per share of Class A Common on the Friday (or if Friday is not a trading day, the last trading day before such Friday) for each week of the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2019.   
(7) J.C. Butler, Jr. may be deemed to be a member of the group, described in Note (8) below, as a result of holding through his trust, of which he is trustee, partnership interests in Rankin II (as defined below).

Rankin and Roger F. Rankin, as trustees and primary beneficiaries of trusts acting as general partners of Rankin I, share the power to vote such shares of Class A Common. Voting actions are determined by the general partners owning at least a majority of the general partnership interests of Rankin I.

The NCG Committee has not specifically identified or published qualifications, qualities or skills that Directors of the Company must possess.  In evaluating Director nominees, the NCG Committee will consider the entirety of each proposed director nominee's credentials.  The NCG Committee will generally consider a diverse number of factors such as judgment, skill, ethics, integrity, values, independence, possible conflicts of interest, experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size or character and the interplay of the candidate's experience and approach to addressing business issues with the experience and approach of incumbent members of our Board of Directors and other new director candidates.  In general, the NCG Committee's goal in selecting directors for nomination to our Board of Directors is to seek a well-balanced membership that combines a diversity of experience and skill in order to enable us to pursue our strategic objectives. Table of Contents
The NCG Committee will consider all information provided to it that is relevant to a candidate's nomination as one of our directors.  Following such consideration, the NCG Committee may seek additional information regarding, and may request an interview with, any candidate.  Based upon all such information, the NCG Committee will meet to determine whether to recommend the candidate to our Board of Directors.  The NCG Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders on the same basis as candidates from other sources.
The NCG Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors.  The NCG Committee regularly reviews the appropriate size of our Board of Directors and whether any vacancies on our Board of Directors are expected due to retirement or otherwise.  In the event vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the NCG Committee may consider various potential candidates.  Candidates may be recommended by current members of our Board of Directors, third-party search firms or stockholders.  No search firm was retained by the NCG Committee during the past fiscal year.  The NCG Committee generally does not consider recommendations for director nominees submitted by individuals who are not affiliated with us.  To preserve its impartiality, the NCG Committee may not consider a recommendation that is not submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth above.
