 Metric/Goal   Definition  
 Adjusted EBITDA   EBITDA consists of net income (loss) attributable to the Company before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items included in net income (loss) and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and (iii) depreciation, amortization and interest of our 50% share of the Zeolyst Joint Venture.   
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow   Adjusted free cash flow consists of cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from asset sales plus net interest proceeds on swaps designated as net investment hedges.
