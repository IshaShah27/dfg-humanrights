PROPOSAL I
APPROVAL OF A NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE TRUST AND LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
Background
The primary purpose of this proposal is to enable Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, Inc. ("LTAM" or the "Adviser") to continue to serve as the investment adviser to the Fund. Until approximately December 24, 2018, Dr. Phillip Frost together with two entities controlled by him, Frost Gamma Investment Trust ("FGIT") and Frost Nevada Investments Trust ("FNIT" and, together with FGIT, the "Frost Trusts"), owned over 35% of the outstanding securities of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. ("LTFS"), the parent company of LTAM. On approximately December 24, 2018, LTFS engaged in a share repurchase and Dr. Frost made several charitable donations that together reduced his and the Frost Trusts' combined ownership stake in LTFS to less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities (the "Transaction").
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), a transaction that results in the transfer of a block of more than 25% of the voting interests of an investment adviser is presumed to constitute an "assignment" of the adviser. The 1940 Act further states that an assignment of an investment adviser causes the adviser's investment advisory agreement to be "assigned," which results in the automatic termination of the agreement by the agreement's terms as required by the 1940 Act. Because the Transaction, as described above, may have resulted in an assignment of LTAM, we are seeking shareholder approval of a new advisory agreement between the Trust and the LTAM (the "New Agreement"). LTAM has served as investment adviser to the Fund pursuant to an advisory agreement (the "Current Agreement") since the Fund commenced operations on September 28, 2010. LTAM believes the Transaction has not and will not result in any interruption or decrease in the quality of services provided by LTAM. Philip Blancato has served as portfolio manager for the Fund since its inception and will continue to serve as portfolio manager under the New Agreement. There will be no changes to the Fund's investment objectives, principal strategies or risks.
The New Agreement will be identical in all material respects to the Current Agreement, except that its date of execution, effectiveness and expiration are changed. The fees to be charged under the New Agreement are identical to the fees charged under the Current Agreement. The effective date of the New Agreement for the Fund will be the date that the Fund's shareholders approve the New Agreement (the "Effective Date").
At a meeting on January 29, 2019 (the "Board Meeting"), the Board approved the New Agreement between the Trust and LTAM, subject to shareholder approval. The 1940 Act requires that investment advisory agreements such as the New Agreement be approved by a vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Therefore, shareholders are being asked to approve the proposed New Agreement with LTAM.
Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act
The parties to the Transaction intend to rely on Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor whereby an investment adviser (such as LTAM) to an investment company (such as the Fund) or an affiliate of such investment adviser may receive payment or benefit in connection with the sale of an interest in the investment adviser if two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that during the three-year period following the Transaction, at least 75% of the investment company's board must not be "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the investment adviser or its predecessor. The Board currently meets this requirement as all of the Trustees are independent and will continue to be independent for the period required. Second, no "unfair burden" can be imposed on the investment company as a result of the Transaction. An "unfair burden" includes: any arrangement during the two-year period after the Transaction where the investment adviser (or predecessor or successor adviser), or any of its "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act), receive or are entitled to receive any compensation, directly or indirectly, (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from or on behalf of the investment company (other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for the investment company), or (ii) from the investment company or its shareholders (other than fees for bona fide investment advisory or other services). The Board determined that there was no "unfair burden" imposed as a result of the Transaction, and the Trust will ensure that this condition will continue to be satisfied for the required time period.
The Advisory Agreement 
The Board, including a majority of the Trustees who are not "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust or LTAM ("Independent Trustees"), originally approved the Current Agreement, dated August 12, 2010, at a meeting held on August 12, 2010, with respect to the Fund. The Board most recently renewed the Current Agreement with respect to the Fund at a meeting held on May 21, 2018. Under the terms of the Current Agreement and the New Agreement, LTAM is entitled to receive an annual fee from the Fund equal to 0.75% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For such compensation, LTAM, at its expense, pays the salaries, expenses and fees of the officers, Trustees and employees of the Trust who are officers, directors, members or employees of LTAM. Additionally, LTAM continuously furnishes an investment program for the Fund, makes investment decisions on behalf of the Fund, and places all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, subject to the Fund's investment objectives, policies, and restrictions and such policies as the Trustees may determine. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, LTAM collected a total of $179,566 in advisory fees from the Fund.
LTAM has contractually agreed to reduce its fees and/or absorb expenses of the Fund, until at least October 31, 2019, so that the total annual operating expenses (exclusive of any front-end or contingent deferred loads; brokerage fees and commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses; fees and expenses associated with investments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example option and swap fees and expenses); borrowing costs (such as interest and dividend expense on securities sold short); taxes; and extraordinary expenses, such as litigation expenses (which may include indemnification of Fund officers and Trustees, contractual indemnification of Fund service providers (other than the adviser)) of the Fund do not exceed 1.75%, 2.50% and 1.50% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to the Fund's Class A, Class C and Class I shares, respectively. Any waiver or reimbursement by LTAM is subject to possible recoupment from the Fund in future years, within the three years after the fees have been waived or reimbursed, if such recoupment can be achieved within the lesser of (1) the expense cap limitation at time of waiver; or (2) the expense cap limitation at the time of recoupment. If approved by shareholders, LTAM will agree to an expense limitation agreement with identical terms.
With respect to the Fund, the New Agreement will continue in force for an initial period of two years from the Effective Date, and from year to year thereafter, but only so long as its continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the Board or (ii) a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, provided that in either event continuance is also approved by a majority of the Independent Trustees, by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting such approval. As with the Current Agreement, the New Agreement automatically terminates on assignment and may be terminated upon 60 days' notice by either LTAM or the Fund. In the case of termination by the Fund, the action must be authorized (i) by resolution of the Board, including the vote or written consent of the Trustees who are not parties to the (New or Current) Agreement or interested persons of either party to thereto, or (ii) by vote of majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
The New Agreement, like the Current Agreement, provides that LTAM shall not be subject to any liability in connection with the performance of its services thereunder in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Trust will enter into the New Agreement with LTAM. If the New Agreement with LTAM is not approved by shareholders, the Board and LTAM will consider other options, including a new or modified request for shareholder approval of the New Agreement.
The New Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You should read the New Agreement. The description in this Proxy Statement of the New Agreement is only a summary.
Information Concerning LTAM
LTAM is a New York corporation located at 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10172. The names, addresses and principal occupations of the principal executive officers of LTAM as of the date of this Proxy Statement are set forth below:
*The address of each principal executive officer listed is c/o Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, Inc., 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, NY 10172.
LTAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company LTFS, which is located at 440 Biscayne Boulevard, 12th Floor, Miami, Florida 33137. LTFS owns 100% of the outstanding voting securities of LTAM.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Fund paid brokerage commissions to Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. ("LTCO") in the amount of $0, which is 0% of the Fund's overall brokerage commissions.
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees 
At the Board Meeting, the Trustees considered the approval of the New Agreement. The Trustees were assisted by independent legal counsel and fund counsel throughout the agreement review process. The Trustees relied upon the advice of independent legal counsel and fund counsel, and their own business judgment in determining the material factors to be considered in evaluating the New Agreement and the weight to be given to each such factor. The conclusions reached by the Trustees were based on a comprehensive evaluation of all of the information provided and were not the result of any one factor. Moreover, each Trustee may have afforded different weight to the various factors in reaching his conclusions with respect to the New Agreement.
Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. The Trustees noted that the Adviser and its affiliates currently managed approximately $2.3 billion in assets and was established in 1982 as a subsidiary of LTFS, which was a full service financial company founded in 1876. The Board noted that the Adviser provided a full complement of financial services including personalized investment strategies to a wide range of clients including individuals, families, foundations, endowments, retirement plans and profit sharing plans. The Board reviewed the background of the key investment personnel responsible for servicing the Fund taking into consideration their education, and the team's diverse financial industry experience which covered research and analysis, investment due diligence, fund selection, and asset allocation. The Board acknowledged the Adviser's expertise with Regulation D type investments and the continual research required to execute the strategy. The Board also noted that the Adviser utilized an investment committee to support the investment process and the portfolio manager, with fundamental research sourced internally and externally and due diligence on the macro-economy and sectors in the Fund. The Board further noted that the Adviser selected investments within each asset class that it determined to have an optimistic outlook as a business to grow or generate an attractive yield for the Fund. The Board also noted that the Adviser monitored compliance with the Fund's investment limitations by reviewing trades and investments daily. The Board noted that the Adviser had risk management processes and dedicated resources to monitor security and sector concentration, liquidity, valuation, and asset class. The Board further noted that the Adviser executed trades for the Fund through an affiliated broker-dealer at an industry competitive commission rates. The Board noted that the Adviser also reviewed a best execution report produced by an independent third party. The Board concluded that the change of ownership would not have any effect on the nature, extent and quality of service provided by the Adviser and it was expected that the Adviser would continue to provide the same level of quality services to the Fund for the benefit of its shareholders.
Performance.   The Trustees noted that the Fund had performed well when compared to the US CE Multi-Alternative category for all time periods presented, but did not perform as well when compared to the Credit Suisse Liquid Alternative Total Return Index, or the US OE Multi-Alternative Morningstar category. The Board further noted that the Fund's portfolio consisted primarily of Master Limited Partnerships, Business Development Companies, and Real Estate Investment Trusts, in which the peer group was not heavily weighted. They noted that the Fund maintained a stable distribution rate made up of both income and return of capital. The Trustees agreed that the Adviser had consistently executed the Fund's investment strategy and should be retained for the benefit of the shareholders.
Fees and Expenses. The Board noted the Adviser charged an annual advisory fee of 0.75% of the average net assets of the Fund. The Board compared the contractual management fee of the Fund to the fees and expenses of a peer group of funds selected by Broadridge. The Trustees noted that the Fund's contractual management fees were slightly lower than the median of the peer group. The Board further noted that the Fund's net expense ratio was higher than the peer group, but considered that the Adviser had contractually agreed to limit the total expenses of the Fund thereby making the Fund's net expenses more comparable to its peers. The Trustees concluded that the Fund's advisory fee, as well as its overall expense ratio, were reasonable in light of the services the Fund would receive from the Adviser under the New Agreement, and the level of fees paid by a peer group of similarly managed funds.
Economies of Scale. The Board considered whether the Adviser had realized economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund and whether there was potential for realization of any further economies of scale. The Trustees noted the Adviser's willingness to consider breakpoints as the Fund grows, that material economies were not expected to be reached during the initial two year term of the New Agreement, and agreed that the matter of economies of scale would be revisited as the Fund's size materially increased.
        Profitability. The Board considered the profits realized by the Adviser in connection with the operation of the Fund, based on materials provided to the Board, and whether the amount of profit was a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the Fund. The Board also considered the profits realized by the Adviser and its affiliate from other activities related to the Fund. The Trustees concluded the Adviser's level of profitability from its relationship with the Fund was not excessive.
 Conclusion.  Having requested and received such information from the Adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the New Agreement, and as assisted by the advice of Counsel, the Board concluded that the advisory fee structure was reasonable and that renewal of the New Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" approval of the New Agreement.
PROPOSAL II
APPROVAL OF PAYMENT OF ACCRUED BUT UNPAID ADVISORY FEES TO LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.
Since the date of the Transaction, fees that would have been earned by LTAM as adviser to the Fund have been withheld pending shareholder approval of the payment of the withheld fees to LTAM. LTAM's advisory fees have been accrued at its current investment advisory expense equal to an annual fee of 0.75% of the Fund's average daily net assets, subject to any required waivers pursuant to LTAM's expense limitation agreement, and withheld since December 24, 2018. As of February 4, 2019, the withheld fees with respect to the Fund totaled $6,394.22.
In connection with the approval of the New Agreement, the Trustees are requesting that shareholders approve the payment to LTAM of the investment advisory fees for LTAM's service to the Fund from December 24, 2018 until the New Agreement is approved by shareholders. Approval of payment to LTAM for its service as the investment adviser to the Fund since December 24, 2018 will not raise the fees paid by the Fund or the Fund's shareholders.
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees
At the Board Meeting, the Board discussed the appropriateness of ratifying the fees paid under the Current Agreement since December 24, 2018. The Board considered that LTAM had continued to manage the Fund with the same amount of resources and expertise as it had since the inception of the Fund. The Board noted that there had been no interruption in LTAM's management of the Fund since the date of the Transaction and that the Transaction did not appear to have had any effect on how LTAM managed the Fund. The Board further noted it would be unfair to LTAM to have to forfeit the accrued advisory fees and that the shareholders should not unjustly benefit from LTAM's management of the Fund's assets without paying for such services. Accordingly, the Trustees concluded that it was appropriate that any advisory fees withheld from LTAM, with respect to the Fund, since December 24, 2018 until the date on which the New Agreement is approved by the Fund's shareholders be paid to LTAM.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" approval of the payment of amounts withheld to LTAM for its service to the Fund since December 24, 2018.
OTHER INFORMATION
OPERATION OF THE FUND
The Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is operated as an interval fund. The Fund is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and formed by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust on June 15, 2010. The Trust's principal executive offices are located at c/o Gemini Fund Services, LLC, 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788. The Board supervises the business activities of the Fund. Like other closed-end funds, the Fund retains various organizations to perform specialized services. The Fund currently retains LTAM as investment adviser. LTCO, located at 277 Park Avenue, 26th Floor, New York, New York 10172, serves as principal underwriter and distributor of the Fund. Gemini Fund Services, LLC, with principal offices located at 17605 Wright Street, Suite 2, Omaha, Nebraska 68130 provides the Fund with transfer agent, accounting, compliance, and administrative services.  
THE PROXY
The Board solicits proxies so that each shareholder has the opportunity to vote on the proposals to be considered at the Meeting. A proxy for voting your shares at the Meeting is enclosed. The shares represented by each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the Meeting as specified. If no specification is made, the shares represented by a duly executed proxy will be voted for approval of the proposed New Agreement, the payment of accrued but unpaid advisory fees to LTAM, and at the discretion of the holders of the proxy on any other matter that may come before the Meeting that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (i) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, (ii) submitting a written notice to the President of the Trust revoking the proxy, or (iii) attending and voting in person at the Meeting.
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING
As of the Record Date, the following numbers of shares of beneficial interest of the Fund were issued and outstanding:
All shareholders of record of the Fund on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Meeting on Proposals I and II. Each shareholder is entitled to one (1) vote per share held, and fractional votes for fractional shares held, on any matter submitted to a vote at the Meeting.
An affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for the approval of Proposals I and II. As defined in the 1940 Act, a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund means the vote of (i) 67% or more of the voting shares of the Fund present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the Fund, whichever is less.
Broker non-votes and abstentions will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum and the number of shares of the Fund represented at the Meeting, but they are not affirmative votes for any proposal. As a result, with respect to approval of Proposals I and II, non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposals because the required vote is a percentage of the shares present or outstanding.
Security Ownership of Management AND Certain Beneficial Owners
To the best knowledge of the Trust, as a group, the Trustees and officers of the Trust owned no shares of the Fund as of the Record Date.
As of the Record Date, the following shareholders of record owned 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Fund:
Shareholders owning more than 25% of the shares of the Fund are considered to "control" the Fund, as that term is defined under the 1940 Act. Persons controlling the Fund can determine the outcome of any proposal submitted to the shareholders for approval.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
The Trust has not received any shareholder proposals to be considered for presentation at the Meeting. Under the proxy rules of the SEC, shareholder proposals may, under certain conditions, be included in the Trust's Proxy Statement and proxy for a particular meeting. Under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Trust's proxy materials must be received by the Trust within a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. The fact that the Trust receives a shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not ensure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion. You should be aware that annual meetings of shareholders are not required as long as there is no particular requirement under the 1940 Act, which must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting. Any shareholder proposal should be sent to Kevin Wolf, President, Alternative Strategies Fund, 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Shareholder proposals may also be raised from the floor at the Meeting without prior notice to the Trust.
COST OF SOLICITATION
The Board of Trustees is making this solicitation of proxies. The Trust has engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., a proxy solicitation firm (the "Proxy Solicitor"), to assist in the solicitation. The estimated fees anticipated to be paid to the Proxy Solicitor are approximately $11,800. The cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and proxy and any additional materials relating to the Meeting and the cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by LTAM. In addition to solicitation by mail, the Trust will request the insurance companies, banks, brokers and other custodial nominees and fiduciaries, to supply proxy materials to the respective beneficial owners of shares of the Fund of whom they have knowledge, and LTAM will reimburse them for their expenses in so doing. Certain officers, employees and agents of the Trust and LTAM may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, facsimile transmission, or mail, for which they will not receive any special compensation.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board knows of no other matters to be presented at the Meeting other than as set forth above. If any other matters properly come before the Meeting that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement, the holders of the proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment, and discretionary authority to do so is included in the proxy.
PROXY DELIVERY
If you and another shareholder share the same address, the Trust may only send one Proxy Statement unless you or the other shareholder(s) request otherwise. Call or write to the Trust if you wish to receive a separate copy of the Proxy Statement, and the Trust will promptly mail a copy to you. You may also call or write to the Trust if you wish to receive a separate proxy in the future or if you are receiving multiple copies now and wish to receive a single copy in the future. For such requests, call the Trust at 1-631-470-2600, or write the Trust at 80 Arkay Drive, Suite 110, Hauppauge, NY 11788.
