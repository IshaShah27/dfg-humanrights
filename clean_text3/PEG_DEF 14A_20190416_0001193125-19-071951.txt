Proxy Statement Summary 
In January 2019, Laura A. Sugg, an accomplished energy industry executive, joined our Board. In December 2018, Hak Cheol (H.C.) Shin resigned from our Board, ending his distinguished service following his acceptance of the chief executive officer position in a corporation headquartered in South Korea and his relocation to Seoul. 
We recognize the value of refreshment and succession planning, annual evaluation of effectiveness and continuing education for our directors. We believe that our directors are a diverse group of highly qualified leaders with a broad range of business, industry, academic and public service experience. Their skills in the areas of accounting/finance, construction/engineering, corporate governance, customer satisfaction and sales, environment/science, government/policy/regulatory, industry/generating plant operations, legal, management, manufacturing, product development, risk management and technology/cybersecurity serve us well. We benefit as well from the strong ethnic and gender diversity of our Board. 
For additional information about director education, evaluation, refreshment and tenure, please see pages 12 and 23. 
For additional biographical information about the diversity, experience, skills and qualifications of each individual nominee please refer to the charts on pages 22 and 27 and biographical data on pages 28-32. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
We have adopted what we believe are strong corporate governance standards and practices to assure effective management by our executives and oversight by our Board. We are committed to good governance because it promotes the long-term interests of stockholders, as well as accountability and trust in our company. These measures include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Independent Directors     Board Leadership     Risk Management     Standards of Conduct 
 Independent Directors     Board Leadership     Risk Management     Standards of Conduct 
   Established  standards for director independence are set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles (Principles). All of our current directors and nominees are independent under our Principles and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), except  Ralph Izzo, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is an employee of the Company. (Page 8)       Our Board leadership structure  consists of a Chairman (who is also our CEO), a Lead Director, who is elected by the independent directors, and strong committee chairs. This provides for independent Board leadership, while ensuring that the individual managing operations leads the  Board discussions on key business and strategic issues. (Page 9)       Risk management is a key part of  our strategic planning and business operations. We believe that we have an effective system of risk management with appropriate controls and Board and Committee oversight. (Page 10)       We are committed to operating in  accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Our Standards of Conduct (Standards) is a code of ethics that establishes a set of common expectations for behavior to which each director and employee must adhere. (Page 18)

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE 
In recent years we have transformed our business mix to include a significantly higher percentage contribution to earnings by PSE&G, as noted in the discussion of Pay for Performance in our CD&A Executive Summary on pages 40-41. 
Our business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand. We continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. These guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improving utility operations through growth in investment in transmission and distribution and other infrastructure  projects designed to enhance system reliability and resiliency and to meet customer expectations and public policy objectives; and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintaining and expanding a reliable generation fleet with the flexibility to utilize a diverse mix of fuels which  allow us to respond to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.    
[END TABLE]
During 2018, our Net Income decreased, as compared to 2017, due primarily to non-cash Net Income benefits in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 related to new tax legislation affecting Power and Energy Holdings, and the recognition in 2018 of net unrealized losses on equity securities in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund as required by new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2018. These decreases were partially offset by accelerated depreciation in 2017 that did not recur in 2018 related to the early retirement of our Hudson and Mercer coal/gas generation units, the favorable impact at Power from the lower federal tax rate effective January 1, 2018 and higher earnings at PSE&G due to investments in transmission and distribution programs and the favorable impact of new rates effective November 1, 2018 as a result of the approval of our distribution base rate case.

Proxy Statement Summary 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Our CD&A Executive Summary on pages 38-43, contains an overview of our executive compensation program, including discussion of say-on-pay, pay mix, peer group, best practices, pay for performance, engagement and key actions. We received approximately 93% approval on our Say-on-Pay proposal at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Compensation Philosophy 
We have designed a competitive executive compensation program benchmarked against our peers that we believe helps us recruit and retain top talent. Our executive compensation program closely links pay to performance with the ultimate goal of aligning our leadership team's interests with stockholders' interests. Our incentives put a significant portion of our executives' pay, including that of our CEO and Named Executive Officers (NEOs), at risk based on performance. These pay-at-risk incentives are targeted to pay out at approximately the median of our peer group when we deliver on our pre-established financial, operating and strategic goals. 
In overseeing executive compensation, our Board utilizes an independent compensation consultant who provides only executive compensation services to the Board. A detailed discussion of our executive compensation program, including its elements, the factors we use in determining compensation and our governance features, appears in the CD&A beginning on page 44. The key components of our executive compensation program are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Proxy Statement Summary 
Pay for Performance 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For 2018, the target annual and long-term incentive pay for our CEO and other NEOs as a group was 87% and 73%,  respectively, of target Total Direct Compensation, as discussed in the CD&A under Compensation Philosophy-Pay Mix (see page 46).    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We compared our recent financial performance and the compensation of our CEO and NEOs to that of our peer companies.  The financial measures we examined were above the median of our peer group while our executive compensation was closely aligned to the peer median. Thus, we have concluded that our performance and executive compensation are appropriately aligned  (see pages 40-41).    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Further, performance is reflected in the actual value paid upon vesting of the  one-year annual cash incentive payments and the three-year equity incentive compensation awards (see page 42).    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For SMICP we set performance ranges to align with our business plan. Approved SMICP payments for 2018 were above  target relative to internal goals, which were heavily weighted towards non-GAAP operating earnings. We continued to reward for strong financial performance and operational excellence (see pages 49-51).    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the PSUs granted under the LTIP for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018, actual  payout was above target, based on our TSR relative to peers and ROIC in relation to our peers and business plan (last grant for which comparison to plan is a measure). Our strong stock price performance and dividend payments have created value for  our stockholders over the three-year period (see pages 52-54).    
[END TABLE]

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board of Directors 
Our business and affairs are managed by or under the direction of the Board, which delegates certain responsibilities to its committees and to management consistent with our By-Laws. The Board has adopted and operates under the Principles which reflect our current governance practices in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and the NYSE. The Principles provide written guidelines for directors and management to effectively pursue and support the Company's business objectives. The Principles are reviewed periodically by the Corporate Governance Committee, which recommends appropriate changes to the Board. In 2018 we revised the Principles to provide more detailed guidance on conflicts of interest, oversight of risk management, refreshment, succession planning and director orientation among other items. You can request copies of our By-Laws and Principles or view them at https://investor.pseg.com/corporate-governance. 
The Board receives regular updates and actively engages in dialogue with our senior management. The Board has full and free access to all members of management and may hire its own consultants and advisors as it deems necessary. 
Board Effectiveness and Accountability 
Our Board, committees and directors undertake to perform their respective duties with the diligence and care required by law and expected of them by our stockholders, customers, employees and communities. We have adopted independence standards, standards of conduct and governance principles and implemented practices that are designed to reinforce our commitment to corporate and personal integrity. The Board monitors our dynamic and responsive stockholder engagement efforts as well as the broader outreach to our other stakeholders, with whom we maintain regular communications. The Board recognizes its role in 
6    PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement 
Corporate Governance continuing to contribute to the future success of our Company by promoting a corporate culture and values based on our core commitments of safety, integrity, continuous improvement, diversity and inclusion and customer service. 
Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship 
The Board understands that its continued oversight of our Company's commitment to principles of sustainability and corporate citizenship is of increasing importance to stockholders, as well as other constituencies. For more than 100 years we have been operating our business with a focus on sustainability, which reflects a deep recognition that our continued ability to prosper as a business depends on building strong relationships with our stakeholders. We produce an annual Sustainability Report, in accordance with the provisions of the Global Reporting Initiative, highlighting our commitments in the areas of Environmental, Social and Governance. In 2018, PSEG established an enhanced business function devoted to Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship, with the senior leader reporting directly to the CEO. This change recognizes the integral role of citizenship to the strategic business objectives of our company. In 2018, we also adopted a human rights practice, formalizing longstanding commitments. 
Environmental 
We have recognized for several decades that climate change is a real phenomenon that impacts our planet. PSEG is proud to be a leader in low carbon energy and have long advocated for comprehensive legislative solutions and public policies to cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gases. Over the past two decades, we have established and achieved carbon reduction goals through energy efficiency programs, deployment of renewable energy, increasing carbon-free nuclear output, building clean and efficient natural gas plants and shifting output from coal to natural gas. We believe that nuclear power, which currently meets approximately 40 percent of New Jersey's electric power needs, is a critical component of New Jersey's clean energy portfolio. We are also replacing aging cast-iron and unprotected steel natural gas infrastructure with new, more durable plastics to reduce leaks of methane, and we continue to enhance our water management practices to reduce potable water usage and concentration of pollutants in discharges. 
Social 
We invest in the communities we serve with a focus on the environment, safety, STEM education and workforce development and diversity and inclusion. Employee citizenship is reflected both on and off the job, through both dedicated service to and volunteerism in our communities. 
Our commitment to health and safety is our foremost priority, underscored through our emphasis on a strong safety culture and continual striving for excellence in every part of our operations. Through our human capital management practices, we promote an environment where employees are engaged, develop and utilize skills, feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns, and directly support key business objectives. PSEG provides employee benefits to promote physical, financial and emotional well-being. 
PSEG sees diversity and inclusion as a business imperative, as we operate and invest in our communities, and as we build a diverse, inclusive and purpose-driven workforce and culture essential to achieving business success. More than one third of the PSEG Foundation giving is focused on diversity and inclusion priorities in our communities and nearly one fifth of PSEG's total supplier spend is with minority, women and veteran-owned suppliers. PSEG enforces a zero-tolerance policy on harassment and fosters a culture of accountability, empathy and understanding. Unconscious bias education, courageous conversation and continuous improvement are areas of enterprise-wide focus. 
Governance 
The Board remains focused on shareholder value, long-term sustainability and strategic vision, in the context of our business environment, competitive landscape and regulatory climate. The organizational and leadership structures we have established, including the responsibilities of our Lead Director and the Board's oversight of our risk management program, executive compensation, talent management and succession planning, political contributions and adherence to company values and sustainability practices, serve to ensure that our Board and management operate effectively while maintaining a keen focus on long-term success. 
Political Participation and Board Oversight 
We are committed to participating in an ethical manner and in full compliance with all federal, state and local laws. We have established a Corporate Political Participation Practice that sets forth a controls process pursuant to which our senior management monitors, assesses and approves certain political contributions. The Corporate Governance Committee also oversees our political activities and contributions in accordance with this Practice. Stockholders may view our Practice at https://investor.pseg.com/sites/pseg.investorhq.businesswire.com/files/doc_library/file/corp_political_participation_practice.pdf.

Corporate Governance 
We prepare a political contributions report that is published annually. The report includes our corporate contributions to candidates, trade associations, other political and, for annual amounts totaling $25,000 or more, social welfare organizations. PSEG requests that trade associations to which it paid total annual payments of $50,000 or more identify the portion of dues or payments received from PSEG that were used for expenditures or contributions that, if made directly by PSEG, would not have been deductible under Section 162(e)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

Corporate Governance 
The Board annually reviews other commercial relationships of directors, and relationships directors have with charitable and other tax-exempt organizations, and determines whether any of those relationships are material relationships that impair a director's independence. Other than the payments by us, reported in this Proxy Statement in the Director Compensation Table, none of our directors have or will receive any compensation or have entered into any "golden leash" arrangements in connection with their service on our Board. 
The Board has determined that all of the current directors and nominees for election, are independent under the Principles and the requirements of the NYSE, except Ralph Izzo, our Chairman of the Board, President and CEO. These determinations were based upon a review of the responses submitted by each director to questionnaires we provided to them, relevant business records, publicly available information and applicable SEC and NYSE requirements. 
Leadership Structure 
Under our By-Laws, our senior leadership may include a Chairman of the Board, a President and a CEO, which positions may be held by one person or may be divided between two different people. As provided in its charter, the Corporate Governance Committee has the responsibility to assess the structure of the Board and periodically evaluate the Board's governance practices as well as the Principles. Building on the advice of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board applies its experience and knowledge of our business to establish what it believes to be the most effective form of organization. In doing so, it utilizes its understanding of the challenges and opportunities we face and its evaluation of the individuals who are involved. 
Based on that analysis and evaluation, the Board has determined that, at the present time and given our present officers and personnel, it is in the best interests of the Company and stockholders for a single individual to hold all three positions of Chairman of the Board, President and CEO. The Board believes that this strikes a desirable balance allowing us to benefit from the advantages of efficiency, coordination and accountability. Ralph Izzo currently holds these positions. As such, he has plenary powers of supervision and direction of our business and affairs and also presides at all meetings of the Board and of stockholders. The Board believes that Mr. Izzo possesses the attributes of experience, judgment, vision, managerial skill and overall leadership ability essential for our continued success. Mr. Izzo's in-depth knowledge and understanding of our strategy, operations, risk profile, regulatory and environmental circumstances and financial condition best position him to head our Board and provide leadership to management, employees, investors, customers, officials and the public. Our Board believes that the diverse experience and independence of the other directors along with a clearly defined and significant Lead Director and independent Committee Chair roles allows the Board to maintain effective oversight of operations, long-range planning, finances and risk management. 
Lead Director 
In addition to the Chairman, President and CEO, our leadership and governance structure is designed to rely on the contributions of our Lead Director. The Lead Director is an independent director designated annually by the independent directors with the expectation that he/she will typically serve in that capacity for four years. The Lead Director may be appointed to serve up to twelve additional months beyond the four years if approved by a majority of the independent directors. The Lead Director provides the independent directors with a key means for collaboration and communication regarding Board agendas and the information directors receive from management. All directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the Board and committee levels, bringing fresh and differing viewpoints. The Lead Director coordinates with the Chairs of our various Board committees in setting agendas for committee meetings. 
Thomas A. Renyi has served as Lead Director since April 2015. Mr. Renyi has decided to retire from our Board upon the completion of his current term, which ends following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Effective at that time, the independent directors have designated Shirley Ann Jackson to serve as Lead Director for a term expiring at the first meeting of directors after the 2020 Annual Meeting.

The Lead Director complements the talents and contributions of Mr. Izzo and promotes confidence in our governance structure by providing an additional perspective to that of management. In particular, the Lead Director leads discussions on certain matters that the Board believes are appropriately headed by an independent director, including CEO succession planning, CEO performance evaluation and compensation and Board self-evaluation. 
Independent Committee Chairs 
The independent Chairs of our Committees shape the agenda for each Committee meeting and provide oversight over matters assigned to the Committee. The Chairs receive preliminary agendas and associated materials in advance of each meeting and regularly conduct pre-meeting reviews of the agenda with members of management. The Chairs also lead the Committee's self-evaluation discussions.

The Board is responsible for the oversight of risk at PSEG, both as a whole and through delegation to Board committees, which meet regularly and report out to the full Board. All committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function. In particular: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the policies and processes by which the Company assesses  and manages enterprise risk. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the mapping of identified enterprise risks to the Board and its committees and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to such mapping. Our Chief Risk Officer and Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) report on risk management to the Corporate Governance Committee, as well as to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee also evaluates our governance and leadership structure, oversees our political participation  activities and expenditures and reputational risk.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee oversees risks related to the Company's financial statements, the financial reporting  process, accounting and legal matters and cybersecurity. The Audit Committee provides oversight on legal and business compliance, financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and reviews in a general manner the guidelines, policies and  processes by which the Company assesses and manages enterprise risk, consistent with the listing standards of the NYSE. Our Chief Risk Officer and CFO report on risk management to the Audit Committee at its in person meetings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Finance Committee oversees financing transactions and approves appropriate commodity portfolio risk tolerance  limits. The Finance Committee is responsible for monitoring risk related to our investments in our pension and post-retirement benefits and nuclear decommissioning trusts and receives periodic reports on their performance.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Organization and Compensation Committee (O&CC) considers the risks and rewards associated with executive  compensation and talent management. As discussed on pages 56-57, the O&CC has reviewed our compensation policies and practices as they relate to risk management and seeks to appropriately balance the  incentive nature of the compensation with mechanisms that serve to mitigate risk.

Risk Mapping 
We have mapped the key enterprise risks identified by management to the Board and committees based on the committees' respective areas of oversight. This mapping of risks serves to clarify the oversight responsibilities of each committee and ensure proper oversight of each identified risk. For example, the oversight of cybersecurity risk management has been expressly mapped to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Board and each committee have determined specific processes and schedules for performing their duties in connection with the mapped risks.

          Risk Management Policy and Program   
          Risk Management Policy and Program

Risk Management Committee Structure 
Under the Risk Management Policy, we have established a Risk Management Committee (RMC) consisting of senior executives. The RMC is charged with, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establishing and reviewing the framework for implementing the Risk Management Policy, including regularly reviewing  and updating key management practices related to risk management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Cybersecurity Council reviews prevalent cybersecurity issues, identifying the cyber risks to our critical  infrastructure and confidential information, including personally identifiable information, as well as the measures the Company is taking or should take to identify and address those risks.  
[END TABLE]
Our corporate compliance activities are centralized functions under our Chief Compliance Officer who has robust duties and responsibilities. Our Delegation of Authority provisions set forth the respective authority levels at which management and employees are authorized to conduct business. 
Cybersecurity 
The Board believes that cybersecurity is a critical component of the risk management program. We have established a comprehensive cybersecurity program that includes a Cybersecurity Council composed of members of senior management and others who are responsible for the Company's cybersecurity risk management practices. The Board and the Audit Committee receive periodic reports on areas such as the adequacy of personnel and resources to monitor and address cybersecurity threats, technological advances in cybersecurity protection, rapidly evolving cybersecurity threats that may affect our Company and industry, cybersecurity incident response and applicable cybersecurity laws, regulations and standards as well as collaboration mechanisms with intelligence and enforcement agencies and industry groups to assure timely threat awareness and response coordination. The Company's cybersecurity risk management practices, including protection of privacy, are fully integrated into our overall risk management program. 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    11 
Corporate Governance 
The Company has established a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our customers' information and our systems. The cybersecurity program is built on technical, procedural, and people-focused measures to detect, protect against, respond to, and recover from cyber threats to our systems and information including company, employee and customer data. Features of our program include: identifying critical information and systems; conducting cyber risk assessments of our and third party systems; maintaining awareness of cyber threats and vulnerabilities through partnerships with public and private entities, as well as industry groups; periodic industry best practice review and operational benchmarking; maintaining and testing our cybersecurity incident response plans and systems; training personnel on cybersecurity issues; and raising cybersecurity awareness throughout our Company with electronic notices and seminars. We have incorporated a cybersecurity escalation process into our cybersecurity program to ensure that senior management is promptly made aware of material cyber events that impact the Company and kept updated during the life of the event. 
Talent Management and Succession Planning 
Our business planning process includes key aspects of workforce planning and development. We believe that we utilize a rigorous and disciplined process to evaluate talent and provide for succession planning in relation to our business objectives. This starts at the local level and continues through senior management, with direct involvement of our CEO and Board. We periodically review our workforce priorities, progress on achieving our commitment to diversity and effectiveness of our organizational structure and staffing. 
The Board takes very seriously its responsibility to provide for an orderly process of succession within the ranks of our senior management. Periodically, the Board reviews with the CEO succession plans for key leadership positions and periodically meets with succession candidates to assure that highly qualified candidates are available, should the need arise to fill vacancies. The Board evaluates succession plans and organizational structure in the context of overall business strategy. Potential leaders are visible to Board members through formal presentations and informal events to allow the directors to personally assess individuals. We seek to maintain a continuity of management through appropriate recruitment and retention methods, including market-based and performance-measured compensation and career advancement and training opportunities. 
Director Education and Board Evaluation 
New directors receive comprehensive materials and an in-person orientation program that includes visits to corporate facilities and presentations by senior management to familiarize them with our strategic plans, operations, significant financial, accounting, and risk management issues, regulatory strategy, governance practices, compliance programs, including the Standards, principal officers and internal and independent auditors. Each year, the Board is briefed and continuing education is provided to all directors on corporate governance trends and best practices and topics of importance to our business, which may include the matters noted above, as well as regular appraisals of new developments and requirements that may impact us and emerging trends facing us and our industry. The Board is also provided with presentations and materials from external consultants and experts, including regulators, investors and legislators. Directors are encouraged to take advantage of other relevant educational programs. 
The Board believes that a robust and constructive evaluation process is an important component of good corporate governance. The Board and each committee conduct an annual assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of their processes and practices, including Board and committee performance, Board composition and culture, Board meetings and risk management. Among the items considered are the monitoring and oversight of policies, evaluation of the CEO and senior officers, consideration of stockholder value, understanding of the business, access to information and resources and opportunity to inquire of, or challenge, management. The process includes a survey of the directors and discussions at Board and committee meetings, as applicable, led by the Lead Director and each respective committee chair.

Meetings of the Board, Committees and Stockholders 
The Board holds regularly scheduled meetings and meets on other occasions when circumstances require. Board and committee meetings are usually scheduled over two days. Each committee executes its responsibilities, as described below, and the Board receives reports from the committee Chairs on the significant matters considered and actions taken. A Board meeting typically focuses on the strategic and more important issues facing us. Directors spend additional time preparing for Board and committee meetings they attend and they are called upon for counsel between meetings. 
Our Principles provide that the Board will meet at least six times each year and in executive session without management in attendance at every meeting, unless waived by the Board. When the Board meets in executive sessions, the Lead Director presides. In addition, each Board committee, except the Executive Committee, meets in executive session, with the independent Chair presiding, at each of its meetings, unless waived by the respective committee. 
Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairman of the Board, CEO, or a majority of the directors by written request at any time. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board or by the CEO or upon the written request of the holders of a majority of the capital stock entitled to cast votes.

Each director is expected to attend all Board meetings and all meetings of committees of which the director is a member. The Board recognizes that, on occasion, meetings will need to be scheduled on short notice and conflicts in schedules will arise that preclude director attendance. However, the Board expects each director will make every effort to keep absences to a minimum. The Board encourages personal attendance and discourages attendance telephonically, unless required by special circumstances. Unless a meeting is specifically designated as "telephonic", the chair should be physically present at the meeting. Each director is also expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. During 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which he/she served. All of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Committee Membership 
Current committee assignments are presented in the following table. Committee assignments and Chairs are regularly reviewed and periodically changed to best utilize the talents of our directors and meet the Company's evolving needs. We believe that rotating committee memberships strengthen our directors' understanding of the challenges we face while bringing greater diversity of perspective and experience to the work of each committee. The last such changes were effective in January 2019. Ongoing committee assignments for all directors typically are made at the organizational meeting of the Board following each Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Compensation Consultant 
The O&CC has the authority to retain advisors and compensation consultants, with sole authority for their hiring and firing. The O&CC is directly responsible for such appointment, compensation and oversight in accordance with the applicable SEC requirements and NYSE standards. Since September 2009, the O&CC has retained Compensation Advisory Partners LLC (CAP) as its independent compensation consultant to provide it with information and advice that is not influenced by management. CAP is an executive compensation consulting firm that does not perform any other services for us or our subsidiaries. CAP provides advice to the O&CC on executive compensation and may also provide advice to the Corporate Governance Committee on matters pertaining to compensation of directors who are not executive officers. CAP may not perform any other services for us without obtaining the prior approval of the Chair of the O&CC. 
In furtherance of CAP's independence, management receives copies of certain materials provided by CAP to the O&CC only under the direction of the O&CC Chair or the O&CC. The scope of CAP's assignment is to provide general advice relating to all aspects of executive compensation, including the review of our current compensation programs and levels, executive benefit plans, analysis of pay and performance alignment, the provision of comparative industry trends and peer data and the recommendation of program and pay level changes. Responsibility for assignment to and evaluation of work by CAP is solely that of the O&CC and, with respect to the compensation of non-employee directors, the Corporate Governance Committee. CAP meets with the O&CC and the Chair without management present when appropriate. 
We pay the fees of any compensation consultant retained by the O&CC. Additional information regarding any such services performed in the past year is included in the CD&A on page 56. The O&CC also utilizes the services of our internal compensation professionals.

Corporate Governance 
Determination of Compensation Consultant's Independence 
The SEC and NYSE require compensation committees to assess the independence of their advisors and determine whether any conflicts of interest exist. In July 2018, the O&CC reviewed CAP's independence relative to the following factors: (i) CAP's provision of other services to the Company; (ii) the amount of fees CAP receives from the Company as a percentage of CAP's total revenue; (iii) the policies and procedures of CAP that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship between O&CC members and CAP or its compensation consultants; (v) any PSEG stock owned by CAP or its compensation consultants; (vi) any business or personal relationship between our executive officers and CAP or any of its compensation consultants; and (vii) other factors that would be relevant to CAP's independence from management. On the basis of such review, the O&CC concluded that CAP is independent and no conflicts of interest exist. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During 2018, each of the following individuals served as a member of the O&CC: Willie A. Deese, William V. Hickey, Shirley Ann Jackson, David Lilley (Chair), Barry H. Ostrowsky, and Richard J. Swift, as well as former directors Albert R. Gamper, Jr. and Hak Cheol (H.C.) Shin. No member of the O&CC was an officer or employee or a former officer or employee of any PSEG company. None of our executive officers served as a director of or on the compensation committee of any of the companies for which any of these individuals served as an executive officer. No member of the O&CC had a direct or indirect material interest in any transaction with us, other than as described on page 19 under Transactions with Related Persons with respect to Barry H. Ostrowsky. 
Standards of Conduct 
We have a long-established corporate culture of emphasizing integrity and honesty with an expectation of adherence to the highest ethical standards. We have embodied these principles in the Standards, our code of ethics. We have substantially revised the format to simplify the presentation by focusing on key concepts and emphasizing the importance of value driven compliance. The Standards are posted on our website, https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/leadershipandgovernance/standardsofintegrity.We will send you a copy upon request. 
The Standards establish a written set of common expectations of behavior for all directors, officers and employees regarding business relationships, personal conduct (including, among other things, corporate opportunities, conflicts of interest and supplier, competitor and governmental relations), safeguarding of Company property, business controls and compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, the Standards mandate procedures for seeking ethical guidance, reporting concerns, investigation and discipline. We require every employee to complete a training program on the Standards and to certify as to compliance with the Standards annually. We provide a hotline by which complaints can be brought to the attention of the Company. Our Chief Compliance Officer has overall responsibility for administering the Standards under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board. 
The Compliance Program establishes an organizational structure and validates the Standards and its mandated procedures, practices and programs. The Audit Committee of the Board has overall responsibility for oversight of the Compliance Program and has delegated to our Compliance Committee overall responsibility for the design, implementation and execution of the Compliance Program. The Compliance Committee's duties include assurance that we take all reasonable steps to coordinate organization-wide ethics and compliance activities, consistent enforcement of the Standards, including the detection and prevention of wrongdoing as a result of compliance investigations and otherwise foster a culture for ethical behavior and a commitment to legal compliance. The Compliance Committee, comprised of members of senior management, is chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer, who has overall responsibility for administering the Compliance Program. 
We will post on our website:

A waiver of any provision of the Standards may be granted in exceptional circumstances, but only for substantial cause. A waiver for any director or executive officer may be made only by the Board and, if granted, will be promptly disclosed to our stockholders. In 2018, we did not grant any waivers to the Standards.

Our Standards, Compliance Program, Related Person Transactions Practice and Conflicts of Interest Practice described below, establish policies and procedures regarding personal and business conduct. Our written management practices provide that any capital investment with a non-PSEG entity or its affiliate, for which one of our directors or officers serves as a director or executive officer, must be approved by our Board. These are our only written policies and procedures regarding the review, approval or ratification of transactions with related persons. 
Transactions with Related Persons 
Our policies and procedures with regard to transactions with related persons, including the review and taking appropriate action regarding any such transactions, the standards applied and the responsibilities for application are set forth in our Related Person Transactions Practice. 
Under the Related Person Transactions Practice, the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board reviews related person transactions with PSEG (including its subsidiaries) in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect interest. In general, related persons are directors, executive officers, their immediate family members, and stockholders beneficially owning 5% or more of our outstanding stock. PSEG must be notified prior to entry into a transaction in which PSEG is or will be a participant and a related person has or will have an interest. 
The Corporate Governance Committee considers related person transactions and material changes to previously approved related person transactions. The Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration a variety of factors and approves or ratifies those related person transactions that are in the best interests of PSEG and its stockholders. The Committee may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate in connection with the approval of the related person transactions. 
When it is impracticable or undesirable to wait until a Committee meeting to consummate a related person transaction, the Committee Chair may review and approve a related person transaction. The Committee Chair reports any approved transactions to the Corporate Governance Committee. 
A list of all existing related person transactions is presented to the Corporate Governance Committee at least annually for review. 
Except as noted below, there were no transactions during 2018, and no transaction currently proposed, in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any related person (director, nominee, executive officer, any person known to us to beneficially own in excess of 5% of our Common Stock, or their immediate family members) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
PSEG Director Barry H. Ostrowsky is the President and CEO of RWJBarnabas Health, Inc. (RWJBarnabas), a non-profit corporation incorporated in New Jersey. 
As part of the Company's philanthropic activities and commitment to invest in the communities in which we do business, the Company, directly or through a subsidiary, and PSEG Foundation, a separate, 501(c)(3) organization that is funded by the Company but whose donations are not determined by the PSEG Board, have periodically made charitable contributions to facilities operated by RWJBarnabas. In 2018, the Company donated approximately $69,000 to facilities affiliated with RWJBarnabas. PSEG Foundation donated approximately $137,000. It is expected that PSEG and PSEG Foundation each will make future contributions to facilities affiliated with RWJBarnabas.
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    19 
Corporate Governance 
Since 2013, the Company's subsidiary, Services, has had a contractual arrangement with an RWJBarnabas affiliate, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton (RWJ Hamilton), pursuant to which RWJ Hamilton provides medical care, medical testing and related services to the Company and its subsidiaries. In 2018, the Company paid a total of approximately $240,000 for services provided pursuant to this arrangement. The Company expects to pay a similar amount in 2019. 
Since 2008, the Company's subsidiary, PSE&G, has engaged in an ongoing Hospital Energy Efficiency Program (HEE Program), through which PSE&G provides funds for energy efficiency upgrades to hospitals throughout the PSE&G service territory. The HEE Program was approved, and is overseen, by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU). As of January 1, 2019, PSE&G has committed to invest approximately $199 million in a variety of hospitals through the HEE Program. PSEG had made commitments of approximately $37.7 million to RWJBarnabas facilities. These projects are in various stages of completion, with several fully completed and others in progress or in the planning stage. The aggregate portion that RWJBarnabas facilities have committed to repay to PSE&G through utility bills in accordance with the BPU-approved terms of the program is equal to approximately $13.3 million. Because the HEE Program is ongoing, the investment and repayment figures are subject to change in the coming years. 
Christopher LaRossa, brother of Ralph A. LaRossa, President and Chief Operating Officer of Power and one of the Company's executive officers, is an employee of, and receives compensation from, PSE&G. During 2018, Christopher LaRossa served and currently serves as District Manager – Regulatory Policy and Procedure. The approximate total compensation paid to Christopher LaRossa during 2018 was within the range set for employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities who hold similar positions at the Company (salary of $111,500 to $223,100 plus incentive compensation targeted at 20% of salary). He also received health insurance and other benefits available to all other employees in a similar position. His compensation was determined in accordance with our compensation practices applicable to employees who hold similar positions. Ralph A. LaRossa did not and does not have any direct responsibility for directing or reviewing his brother's work or any influence over his brother's compensation or the other terms of his employment. 
Conflicts of Interest 
Our Conflicts of Interest Practice applies to all employees, contractors, suppliers and any third party working on behalf of PSEG and covers situations where individual interests are or could be at odds or in conflict with PSEG's interests. Such situations are required to be reported to our Office of Ethics and Compliance, which may conduct an investigation or take actions it deems appropriate. 
The Principles provide that a director must notify the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee if he/she encounters a conflict of interest or proposes to accept a position with an entity which may present a conflict of interest, so that the issue may be reviewed. Potential conflicts of interest include positions that directors or immediate family members hold as directors, officers or employees of other companies with which we do business or propose to do business and charitable and other tax-exempt organizations to which we contribute or propose to contribute.

Nominees and Election 
NOMINEES AND ELECTION 
Election 
Directors elected at each annual meeting are elected to serve one-year terms. Directors whose terms are to expire are eligible for re-nomination and will be considered by the Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with its policies and the retirement policy for directors, which are summarized in this Proxy Statement. Each of the current directors has been nominated for re-election, with the exception of Thomas A. Renyi, who is retiring from the Board at the expiration of his term at the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Our By-Laws currently provide that the Board shall consist of not less than three nor more than 16 directors as shall be set from time to time by the Board. The number of directors is currently set at eleven and will be reduced to ten upon the retirement of Mr. Renyi.  
The nominees listed below were selected by the directors upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee. As discussed on pages 78-80 under Annual Meeting, Voting and Procedures, proxies will be voted in accordance with your instructions as indicated on the enclosed proxy card, voting instruction form or when voting by telephone or Internet. 
If at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting any of the nominees listed below should be unable to serve, which is not anticipated, it is the intention of the persons designated as proxies to vote, in their discretion, for other nominees, unless the number of directors constituting a full Board is reduced. 
Majority Voting for Election of Directors 
Our By-laws provide that in an uncontested election, each director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. We do not include as votes cast (i) shares which are marked withheld, (ii) abstentions and (iii) shares as to which a stockholder has given no authority or direction. 
As provided in the Principles, the Board has adopted a policy whereby any incumbent director receiving a majority vote "against" must promptly tender an offer of resignation. As a result, in uncontested elections, the Board will nominate for election or re-election as a director only candidates who have agreed promptly to tender a letter of resignation in the event that the number of shares voted "for" that director does not exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director. If an incumbent director fails to receive the required "majority" vote, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider the matter and then make a recommendation to the Board as to whether or not to accept the resignation. The Board will make the determination on whether or not to accept the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee. 
Failure to Receive a Majority Vote 
The Principles further provide that no director who fails to receive a majority vote in an uncontested election shall participate in either the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee or the determination of the Board with respect to his/her resignation letter or that of any other director in regard to that year's Annual Meeting election. Any such director may, however, participate in any and all other matters of the Board and its various committees to the fullest extent to which he/she would otherwise be permitted in accordance with applicable law and the Principles. If a majority of the Corporate Governance Committee fails to receive a majority vote, then the remaining independent directors will determine whether to accept one or more of the applicable resignations. If three or fewer independent directors do not receive a majority vote in the same election, then all independent directors may participate in any discussions or actions with respect to accepting or rejecting the resignation offers (except that no director will vote to accept or reject his/her own resignation offer). 
In evaluating tendered resignations, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider all factors they deem relevant, including, but not limited to, the stated reason(s) for the "against" vote, the impact that the acceptance of the resignation would have upon our compliance with applicable law or regulation, the potential triggering of any change in control or similar provision in contracts, benefit plans or otherwise, the qualifications of the director and his/her past and anticipated future contributions to us. 
The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider possible remedies or actions to take in lieu of or in addition to accepting or rejecting of the resignation, such as development and implementation of a plan to address and cure the issues underlying the failure to receive a majority vote. 
Following the Board's determination, we will publicly disclose the decision and, as applicable, the reasons for accepting or rejecting the resignation. To the extent that the Board accepts one or more resignations, the Corporate Governance Committee may recommend to the Board, and the Board will then determine, whether to fill any vacancy. 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    21 
Nominees and Election 
Ability and Diversity 
The Board believes that a nominee for director should be selected on the basis of the individual's ability, diversity of background and experience and soundness of judgment, from among candidates with an attained position of leadership in their field of endeavor. As noted above, a majority of the Board must consist of independent directors in accordance with our Principles and NYSE requirements. 
The Board is guided by its consideration of how to best enhance its capability to oversee the affairs of the Company. It analyzes the skills it believes are necessary for effective governance of a leading company in our industry and the particular attributes and abilities of each individual. The Board does not believe that adopting arbitrary or inflexible policies or requirements will achieve that purpose. Rather it looks to promote better governance through a more dynamic examination and understanding of its members' abilities to meet evolving challenges. It values the mix of skills and experience, independence from management, fresh perspectives and seasoned knowledge that collectively help to guide the Company.

       Diversity is  a factor for consideration of nominees for director pursuant to the diversity policy contained in our Principles and the charter of the Corporate Governance Committee. In considering diversity, the Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a broad  meaning to include not only factors such as ethnicity and gender, but also background, experience, leadership positions, skills, accomplishments, financial expertise, professional interests, personal qualities and other traits desirable in achieving  an appropriate group of qualified individuals. The Corporate Governance Committee considers and assesses the effectiveness of this policy in connection with the annual nomination process to assure the Board contains an effective mix of people to  best further our long-term business interests.

The Board recognizes the value to the Company of directors with varied backgrounds.

Similarly, refreshment of the Board brings new ideas and viewpoints and tenure is considered in light of our current policy to limit a director's term of service following attainment of age 75.

22    PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement 
Nominees and Election 
Refreshment and Tenure 
The Corporate Governance Committee is very aware of the benefits of the refreshment of Board members to assure that new perspectives and ideas are considered. In selecting individuals for our Company, with its long investment horizon, the Corporate Governance Committee weighs the need for both director refreshment and institutional knowledge. It believes that the appropriate mix of varied levels of tenure and experience can help mitigate risk. This includes replenishing desired skills and experience as directors leave the Board. We also refresh Board committees through rotation of memberships, as noted under Committee Membership. 
The Corporate Governance Committee does not believe it is appropriate to set absolute term limits on the length of a director's term, but rather seeks to achieve a balance in the longevity of service through appropriate Board refreshment. Directors who have served on the Board for an extended period of time are able to provide valuable insight into the operations and future of the Company based on their experience with and understanding of our history, policies and objectives. 
The Corporate Governance Committee is cognizant of the many years of service of some Board members. In evaluating that factor when making its nominating recommendations, it believes that average tenure is a better measure than the individual time served by any one member or another. Average tenure recognizes the refreshment that takes place as long-serving members retire and new directors join the Board. At the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting, upon election of the nominees, the average tenure of the members of our Board for their current term of service will be approximately ten years. In the past three years, we have refreshed our Board with three new members along with three retirements, the last of which will be effective as of the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting. At that time, as shown in the table below, upon the election of the nominees presented in this Proxy Statement, the tenure of our directors will be balanced across a spectrum of experience on our Board. Further, pursuant to our policy on director age under our Principles, we expect that two of our current directors in the 11+ years category below will not be standing for re-election in 2020. 
Director and Nominee Qualifications and Availability 
The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board periodically review the skills and qualifications that they determine are necessary for the proper oversight of the Company by the directors in furtherance of their fiduciary duties. The Committee and the Board remain focused on ensuring that the individual and collective abilities of the directors continue to meet the governance needs of the Company. They are committed to nominating individuals who satisfy the applicable criteria for outstanding service to our Company and who together comprise the appropriate Board membership composition in light of evolving business demands. The Board evaluates the effectiveness of each director in contributing to the Board's work and the potential of each new nominee. 
It is the Board's policy that a nominee recommended initially for election be able to serve at least five years, consistent with the Board's retirement policy. The Board believes that the ability of a director to serve for at least five years is a reasonable expectation in order for us to receive an appropriate benefit from the individual's abilities. This is especially so in light of the time invested by a director to become knowledgeable about our complex business operations. The Board believes that these service limitations provide it with a means for achieving a reasonable balance of veteran and new directors. 
The Corporate Governance Committee also considers the amount of time that a person will likely have to devote to his/her duties as a director, including non-PSEG responsibilities as an executive officer, board member or trustee of business or charitable institutions and the contributions by directors to our ongoing business. The Corporate Governance Committee considers the qualifications of incumbent directors and potential new nominees, as well as the continuity of service and the benefit of new 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    23 
Nominees and Election ideas and perspectives, before making recommendations to the Board for election or re-election. The Board then selects nominees based on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation. 
Prior to accepting an invitation to serve as a director of another public company, the CEO and any directors must submit a letter to the Corporate Governance Committee so as to allow it to review potential conflicts and time demands of the new directorship. Any director who undertakes or assumes a new principal occupation, position or responsibility from that which he/she held when he/she was elected to the Board must submit a letter to the Corporate Governance Committee volunteering to resign from the Board. The Board does not believe that in every instance a director who undertakes or assumes a new occupation, position or responsibility from that which he/she held when the director joined the Board should necessarily leave the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the relevant details of such director's new position and determines the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the circumstances. 
The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe that the experience gained through other directorships provides us with a breadth of valuable knowledge and insight. Exposure to other industries, management and issues gives a director a perspective not necessarily otherwise available to him/her from a more limited range of experience. The Corporate Governance Committee carefully monitors the attendance and participation of each director to assure that he/she demonstrates an appropriate level of commitment and effort in serving on our Board. In renominating the current directors, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board determined that each director had successfully balanced the demands on his/her time and attention in meeting the fiduciary obligations to us. 
Director Terms of Service 
The Board seeks to maintain an orderly transition for phased termination of service and proper succession planning. Under the Board's policy, set forth in our Principles, directors who have never been employees of the PSEG group of companies may not serve as directors beyond the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in the calendar year following their seventy-fifth birthday. 
We believe that the current retirement age allows us to benefit from long-serving directors, including their industry expertise, institutional knowledge, historical perspective, stability and continuity and comfort with challenging Company management, while maintaining our ability to refresh the Board through the addition of new members. Our Board has a high level of diversity in tenure and qualifications. 
Directors who are former PSEG CEOs may not serve as directors beyond the Annual Meeting of Stockholders following termination of active employment with the PSEG group of companies, unless otherwise determined by the Board, and may not serve beyond their seventy-fifth birthday. Directors who are former employees, other than CEOs, may not serve as directors beyond the Annual Meeting of Stockholders following termination of active employment with PSEG. 
Stock Ownership 
We believe that it is an important aspect of Board service for the interest of each individual member of our Board to align with the interests of our stockholders. Our Principles require that directors own shares of our Common Stock (including any restricted stock, whether or not vested, any stock units under the Directors' Equity Plan and any phantom stock under the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan) equal to five times the annual retainer (currently $95,000) within five years after election to the Board. We believe that this requirement is competitive with market practice. All incumbent directors currently meet this stock ownership level except for Mr. Ostrowsky, who joined the Board in February 2018 and Laura A. Sugg, who joined the Board in January 2019. Additional details can be found in the table under Security Ownership of Directors, Management and Certain Beneficial Owners on page 33.

Nominees and Election 
Nomination Process and Proxy Access 
The Corporate Governance Committee considers the qualifications of Board members, evaluates prospective nominees and recommends candidates to the Board of Directors, in thoughtful recognition of the criteria discussed in this Proxy Statement. The Board's evaluation is focused on aligning the skills, qualifications and experience of our Board with the strategic development of our Company. Individual and collective competencies, personal characteristics, diversity of experience and backgrounds and commitment to the Company are assessed. The Corporate Governance Committee on occasion may pay a fee to an executive search firm to assist it in identifying and evaluating potential director nominees meeting our criteria, which are described further in this Proxy Statement. Any such firm's function would be to assist the Committee in identifying potential candidates for its consideration. During 2018, we engaged a third-party firm to assist in identifying and evaluating potential candidates, including those brought to our attention by members of the Board. One of the identified candidates, Laura A. Sugg, was elected to the Board at a meeting held in December 2018, effective on January 1, 2019. 
The Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholders' recommendations for nominees for election to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee utilizes the same criteria to evaluate all potential nominees, including those recommended by stockholders or other sources. Our By-Laws require that stockholder nominations must be delivered to the Company's Secretary at least 90 days in advance of an Annual Meeting of Stockholders. With respect to an election to be held at a special meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, such advance notice of the nomination must be delivered to the Company's Secretary no later than the close of business on the seventh day following the date on which notice of such meeting is first given to stockholders. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the advance notice procedure contained in our By-Laws. 
In order for a stockholder's proposed nominee to be included in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our By-Laws, such proposal must be received by the Company's Secretary no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing date of the Company's proxy statement in the prior year. The proxy access provisions of our By-Laws permit an eligible stockholder (or a group of no more than 20 eligible stockholders) owning 3% or more of the Company's common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate director candidates representing up to 25% of the Board, and, upon the eligible stockholder's satisfaction of certain conditions as outlined in our By-Laws, require us to include such nominees in our proxy statement and proxy card for the annual meeting of stockholders. These proxy access provisions were adopted by the Board in 2015.

Director Compensation 
Director Compensation 
Board Compensation 
As provided in our Principles, director compensation is reviewed periodically by the Corporate Governance Committee, which makes recommendations to the Board for changes. The Board may periodically modify compensation of Board members, Committee Chairs and the Lead Director as appropriate. It is the Board's intention to provide compensation to non-management directors that is comparable to median director compensation among our peer companies, in order to be able to attract and retain high quality Board members. This compensation is expected to include a retainer, and may include PSEG Common Stock, meeting fees, restricted stock compensation and reimbursement for expenses for attending Board and Committee meetings and related functions. Directors who are compensated as officers or employees do not receive any additional compensation for Board membership. In accordance with PSEG's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company provides indemnity and reimbursement of expenses to the full extent permitted by law. PSEG provides directors' and officers' insurance to cover responsibilities of directors and officers. 
Every two years, CAP assesses the competitiveness of director compensation for the Corporate Governance Committee. 
As an employee of PSEG, Mr. Izzo receives no additional compensation for services as a director. His compensation as an employee is shown in this Proxy Statement in the executive compensation tables and CD&A. 
Directors are compensated in accordance with the schedule below. All amounts are paid in cash, except the equity grant, which is paid in Common Stock units equal to the amount shown. All payments to the Chairs and Committee members, as indicated, are per assignment and incremental to the annual retainer and equity grant. Following a review of peer company market data conducted by CAP, the fee schedule was last revised effective for May 1, 2016.

Directors' Equity Plan 
The Directors' Equity Plan is a deferred compensation plan and, under its terms, each outside director is granted an award of "stock units" each May 1st (in an amount determined from time-to-time by the Board) which is recorded in a bookkeeping account in his/her name and accrues credits equivalent to the dividends on shares of our Common Stock. If a director fails to remain a member of the Board (other than on account of disability or death) until the earlier of the succeeding April 30th or the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the award for that year will be prorated to reflect actual service. Distributions under the Directors' Equity Plan are made in shares of our Common Stock after the director terminates service on the Board in accordance with distribution elections made by him/her, which may be either in a lump-sum payment or, with respect to grants made prior to 2012, in annual payments over a period of up to ten years. 
Under the Directors' Equity Plan, with respect to grants made beginning in 2012, directors may elect to commence distribution of a particular year's deferrals either upon termination of service or after a specified number of years thereafter. A director may elect to receive distribution of such deferrals in the form of a lump-sum payment, or annual installments over a period of three to fifteen years. Distribution elections must be made prior to the date that the services giving rise to the awards are performed. 
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may elect to defer any portion of their director fees by making appropriate elections in the calendar year prior to the year in which the services giving rise to such compensation being deferred is rendered. At the same time he/she elects to defer such compensation, the participant must make an election as to the timing of the distribution from his/her Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan account. Distributions are made in cash. Deferred amounts are invested on behalf of each director as described below under Investments. 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    35 
Director Compensation 
For amounts deferred prior to 2012, distributions may commence (a) on the thirtieth day after the date he/she terminates service as a director or, in the alternative, (b) on January 15th of any calendar year following termination of service elected by him/her, but in any event no later than the later of (i) January of the year following the year of his/her 71st birthday or (ii) January following termination of service. Participants may elect to receive the distribution of their Directors' Deferred Compensation account in the form of one lump-sum payment, or annual distributions over a period selected by the participant, up to ten years. 
With respect to compensation deferred beginning in 2012, directors may elect to commence distribution of a particular year's deferrals, either (a) within 30 days of termination of service, or (b) a specified number of years following termination of service. They may elect to receive distribution of such deferrals in the form of a lump-sum payment, or annual installments over a period of three to fifteen years. 
Participants may make a distribution election for each year's deferred compensation. Participants may also make changes regarding the timing of distribution elections with respect to prior deferred compensation as long as any such new distribution election is made at least one year prior to the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred and the revised commencement date is at least five years later than the date that the commencement of the distribution would otherwise have occurred. 
Investments 
Participants may choose to have amounts deferred under the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan credited with earnings based on (i) the performance of one or more of investment portfolio funds, (ii) at the rate of Prime plus 1/2%, capped at 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, or (iii) by reference to the performance of our Common Stock, in such percentages designated by the participant. These are the same investment options offered under our 401(k) plan to employees (except the Fidelity Brokerage Link Account). A participant who fails to provide a designation will accrue earnings on his/her account at the rate of Prime plus 1/2%, capped at 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate. A participant may change fund selection daily, except for the Common Stock Fund, for which selection may be made only prior to deferral. 
The one-year rates of return as of December 31, 2018 for the offered funds as computed by the record keeper for the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan were as follows:

Executive Compensation 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing you with an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on our executive compensation programs as described in this Proxy Statement. This is commonly referred to as "say-on-pay." We plan to do this each year, in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC. 
This vote is advisory and, thus, it is non-binding on us and the Board. However, management, the O&CC and the Board intend to carefully review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation. In accordance with applicable SEC requirements, we will disclose to you in our future proxy statements how our compensation policies and decisions have taken into account the results of the most recent stockholder advisory vote on our executive compensation. 
We have disclosed in this Proxy Statement an overview of the philosophy and elements of our executive compensation program, as well as the details of the individual compensation paid or awarded to each of our NEOs and our process for making those determinations. We have provided below the Report of our O&CC, the CD&A and the compensation tables. In our CD&A, we have explained the reasons supporting our executive pay decisions as reported in the various tables and accompanying narrative included in this Proxy Statement. We have summarized the highlights in our CD&A Executive Summary. 
We believe our executive compensation is reasonable and appropriate, reflecting market conditions and performance. We are asking you to indicate your support of our executive compensation program as described in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific individual. Rather, it is an indication of your agreement with the overall philosophy, policies, practices and compensation of our executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, as recommended by the Board, we ask for you to vote in favor of the following resolution: 
Resolved, that the stockholders hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the applicable rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, compensation tables and narrative discussion. 
Vote required: We will tally the votes cast in person or by proxy, excluding abstentions and shares withheld or for which no instructions are given. 
  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RESOLUTION IN THIS PROPOSAL.

Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation program is designed to closely link pay and performance and align the interests of our executives with stockholders. We are focused on connecting executive compensation design with corporate strategy and results. We have structured our program to tie executive compensation to the successful execution of our strategic plans, meeting our financial and operational goals and delivering strong returns while balancing the interests of our multiple stakeholders, which include our stockholders, the customers we serve, our employees and the communities in which we operate. This translates into higher compensation in years of strong performance and stockholder returns and lower compensation when performance is not as strong. 
We provide a peer-competitive compensation package to attract and retain exceptional executive talent needed for long-term success, with incentives for our executives to achieve outstanding individual performance and business results. 
The O&CC annually reviews and evaluates the objectives, design and effectiveness of our compensation program. The O&CC maintains the flexibility to make decisions about the program and actual compensation levels and awards based on achievement of our business objectives and relevant circumstances affecting our Company. In addition to the established performance measures, these may include economic, market and competitive conditions, regulatory and legal requirements, internal pay equity considerations and peer group or market best practices. The O&CC and the Board seek to align strong pay for performance with long-term stockholder value creation without encouraging excessive risk taking. Our directors are committed to acting in the best interest of stockholders as responsible stewards overseeing our executive compensation program. 
We take great care in making any adjustments to incentive plans. We use metrics that we believe more directly relate to the ongoing operations of our industry, as these are primary indicators for evaluating performance, allocation of resources and planning and forecasting in the future. Our commitment to employee accountability and the importance of integrity and ethical behavior on the part of all employees is reflected in our Company core commitments and values embedded throughout our compensation philosophy and programs. 
Total Direct Compensation (base salary plus target annual incentive and target long-term incentive) is targeted at the median of our peer group with variation from median recognizing differences in roles, performance, job scope, experience and volatility of market data from year to year. An overwhelming portion of our CEO's and NEOs' compensation (i.e., annual and long-term incentives) is performance-based and tied to stockholders' interests rather than to base salary.

The left column outlines the practices we believe are conducive to encouraging sound performance by our senior executives and good governance.

              Stretch Performance Goals.

PSUs emphasize relative performance to link above-target payouts to when we outperform peers.                      No Guaranteed Compensation. No target adjustments and limited  guaranteed bonuses.

Pay for Performance 
Our long-range strategy, with its emphasis on business fundamentals, is designed to deliver shareholder value. We focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment to achieve growth while managing risk. Our strategy has been to deliver long-term value to our stockholders as we confront market pressures and regulatory uncertainty. We strive to set stretch goals. For 2018, we set SMICP targets that were higher than actual 2017 results for the PSEG and PSE&G earnings components. Recognizing that our business is highly sensitive to factors outside our control, including energy prices and weather, in some years our goals in the SMICP may be below the prior year's results. We believe that this is common among our peers. Accordingly, Power's SMICP earnings target was set slightly below 2017 actual results. Current PSU awards are based entirely on relative performance vs. peers to ensure we only payout above target when we outperform peers. Performance on the PSUs vested in 2018 includes an additional metric for ROIC vs. business plan. We have emphasized utility growth and mitigation of merchant generation risk while operating in a cost-efficient manner. We have aligned our compensation structure with the performance results we expect our executives to attain in carrying out this strategy.

          Alignment of Performance and Compensation   
     We compared our financial performance  with the compensation of our CEO and NEOs relative to our peer companies. The financial measures we examined were above the median of our peer group of companies while our executive compensation was closely aligned to the peer median. Accordingly,  we concluded that our performance and executive compensation are appropriately aligned.     We continue to reward for strong  financial performance and operational excellence. Our SMICP payouts for 2018, heavily weighted towards earnings, were above target relative to internal goals. Our PSU payouts for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018, were  above target as our ROIC vs. peers was above target, ROIC vs. plan was below target and TSR vs. peers was above target.

The charts below compare the relative contributions to earnings of PSE&G and Power over the past five years and show our steady earnings and consistent dividend growth in those years. We believe that these graphs demonstrate the successful implementation of our business strategy that continues to deliver value to our shareholders. This impact on our earnings is reflected in the realized pay of our NEOs, since our executive compensation program links incentive payouts to earnings measures over multiple time frames. Accordingly, we show below the annual TSR and ROIC in the last three years compared to our 2018 peer group. Our financial highlights are presented on page 3. You can find a more comprehensive discussion of our 2018 business and financial performance in our 2018 Form 10-K.

Strategic Long-Term Management Focus 
The judgment and operational and managerial abilities that we expect of our senior executives are critical factors in positioning us for a successful future. Their performance in improving our operating efficiencies, actively influencing legislative and regulatory policies and adjusting our business mix by shifting investment to best take advantage of emerging opportunities for growth, particularly in connection with utility rate-regulated returns are reflected in our results. The success of these actions cannot be measured over a single year, which is why we use multiple time horizons in our incentive structure. As a result of the continued focus on operational excellence, financial strength, continuous improvement and disciplined investment, the O&CC believes that our management team has effectively responded to challenging conditions. 
Stockholder Engagement and Transparent Disclosure 
We have a long-standing practice of engaging in constructive dialogue with our stockholders on various matters of interest to them, including corporate governance, executive compensation, business performance and strategy, risk management and sustainability. Our CEO and CFO meet periodically with our major stockholders and groups of investors at conferences and elsewhere and our Investor Relations team maintains regular written communications with these institutions and individuals. 
In recent years, we have enhanced both our visibility and our efforts with regard to matters of executive compensation and corporate governance to keep pace with evolving investor priorities and expectations. 
We strive to be clear and transparent in the information we provide to investors in our Proxy Statement, Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC and in our investor communications. We believe our executive compensation disclosure addresses the issues considered most important to, and provides the useful information desired by, our stockholders, as evidenced by the feedback we receive at our meetings throughout the year. We always welcome stockholders' comments and suggestions. We have enhanced our proxy statement disclosure in both content and presentation format and will continue to consider the outcome of the say-on-pay vote when making future compensation decisions regarding executive compensation.

Executive compensation is governed under the direction and authority of the O&CC. The O&CC is made up of directors who are independent under NYSE rules and our requirements for independent directors. The O&CC receives advice from its independent compensation consultant, CAP, which provides only compensation consulting services to the Board and not to management. 
Our CD&A describes our executive compensation program, including 2018 total compensation for our NEOs, who are listed below. The CD&A explains our:

In the CD&A Executive Summary beginning on page 38, we specifically address those areas which we believe are of utmost interest to our stockholders. A complete reading of the CD&A provides a more thorough description of our compensation program and explanation of our recent activities. 
Compensation Philosophy 
Pay for Performance 
We believe it is important to link pay with performance and long-term stockholder value. We utilize compensation to further align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders as well as other stakeholders. However, we believe that it is crucial to our stockholders' long-term interests that we not measure performance too narrowly on merely a single year's results. Our compensation programs are designed to reward for performance over varying time horizons with our incentives linked to successful implementation of our corporate strategic objectives. 
44    PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our SMICP annual incentive focuses on financial and operating performance over a one-year period while our LTIP focuses on multi-year performance. Similarly, the goals of individual NEOs, including our CEO, place a high value on strategic initiatives, long-range planning, disciplined investments and operational excellence which drive value and ensure we meet our responsibilities as a public utility. While the impact of this approach may not necessarily be seen in any single year, over time the actual value of compensation, especially equity grants, reflect our Company's performance. 
When we establish performance targets, we consider internal and external factors and set stretch goals to reflect an appropriate degree of difficulty. Our incentive compensation payouts are determined largely based on financial measures that align CEO and NEO compensation with stockholder interests, as non-GAAP EPS, TSR and ROIC are used in calculating the amounts. 
Each year, the O&CC, with the assistance of CAP, considers the pay for performance relationship not just from a target pay perspective, but also considering the actual realizable pay, which reflects our stock price performance. 
If you would like additional information about our 2018 performance, including our financial statements and a more complete description of our business, please see our 2018 Form 10-K. 
Peer Comparison and Benchmarking 
During 2018, the O&CC reviewed relative financial performance data comparing us to those companies in our peer group for whom data was available. Included in the metrics were operating income margin, EPS growth, ROIC and TSR, all versus peers. Total Cash Compensation included base salary and SMICP. Total Direct Compensation included those two items plus the target value of LTIP awards. These performance metrics were broader than the measures we use in determining award payouts under the SMICP and LTIP in order to provide a more holistic view of overall Company performance. 
In evaluating the compensation of the NEOs and in particular the CEO, we assessed the amount relative to the performance delivered and continue to conclude the two are aligned. 
How We Choose Peers 
We evaluate and set executive compensation to be competitive within an identified peer group comprised of similarly-sized energy companies. In doing so, we considered our peers' revenues, earnings and market capitalization. Given the nature of the industry, in recent years there have been limited comparable integrated companies with a mix of regulated utility and merchant generation operations. Therefore, the peer group is made up primarily of regulated utilities, with three integrated companies and one pure merchant power company included. 
Each year, we re-evaluate the peer group to assess its appropriateness. Effective in 2018, we removed NiSource Inc. as its business mix is no longer comparable to ours and Calpine Corp., as it was acquired. We added CenterPoint Energy, Inc. based on its business mix and market capitalization. Our peer companies for 2018 are listed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Ameren Corporation     American Electric Power Co., Inc.     CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 
   Ameren Corporation     American Electric Power Co., Inc.     CenterPoint Energy, Inc. 
 Consolidated Edison, Inc.     Dominion Resources, Inc.     DTE Energy Company 
 Duke Energy Corporation     Edison International     Entergy Corporation* 
 Eversource Energy     Exelon Corporation*     FirstEnergy Corp. 
 NextEra Energy, Inc.*     NRG Energy, Inc.**     PG&E Corporation 
 PPL Corporation     Sempra Energy     Southern Company 
[END TABLE]
*Integrated company 
**Pure merchant power company 
How We Use Peer Data 
The 2018 peer group was used as a reference point for setting pay levels for 2018. The O&CC targets the median (50th percentile) of the peer group for positions comparable to those of our officers for Total Direct Compensation. The peer group is also used for comparison in assessing our performance under our LTIP, the alignment between pay and performance and reviewing incentive plan design, equity usage and governance practices. 
Pay Governance LLC assists in analyzing the annual Willis Towers Watson Energy Services Executive Compensation Survey–U.S. assessment of the market using the peer companies. We use the peer group data to the extent each position is reported in the survey data. CAP also reviews the outcome of the competitive assessment.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Compensation Benchmark 
The O&CC considers a range of approximately +/-20% of the 50th percentile of benchmark positions to be within the competitive range, with an emphasis on Total Direct Compensation. 
Base salary, target Total Cash Compensation and target Total Direct Compensation of each of the NEOs as a percentage of the comparative median benchmark levels of the peer group are noted below, along with each individual's time in position when these decisions were made in December 2017.% of Comparative Median Benchmark Levels (2018) 
Note: Reflects decisions made for 2018 components and excludes Mr. LaRossa's 2018 retention grant. 
Pay Mix 
The O&CC believes that target Total Direct Compensation is a better measure for evaluating executive compensation than focusing on each of the elements individually and they do not set a formula to determine the mix of the various elements. We consider that the majority of a senior executive's compensation should be performance-based and the more senior an executive's position is in the organization, the more his/her pay should be oriented toward long-term compensation. 
The mix of base salary, target annual cash incentive and target long-term incentives for 2018 are presented below for the CEO as well as for the other NEOs excluding the CEO. We have also provided a peer group comparison. Value at risk represents performance-based incentive awards of cash, RSUs and PSUs.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Performance and Goals 
We have provided detailed calculations of the payouts under our SMICP and LTIP, including a discussion of the pre-established goals for these incentive plans and the performance achieved by our NEOs. 
We do not disclose forward looking targets for our incentive plans, as the disclosure could result in competitive harm and be detrimental to our operating performance. On an annual basis, the O&CC and CAP, our independent consultant, review the degree of difficulty of the targets to ensure we are driving performance. 
Targets are set based on the proposed business plan and a rigorous process is undertaken at the start of each year to determine the range of performance for each measure. The corporate and business unit performance goals are set at levels we believe require strong performance for a target payout, and superior performance for a greater than target payout.

The table does not include actual SMICP payouts, change in pension values and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings and all other compensation, which are shown in the Summary Compensation Table. SMICP and LTIP amounts in the graph above reflect the target values. Actual payouts are reported in the CD&A following the applicable performance period. 
After meeting in executive session, without the CEO present, the O&CC recommended CEO compensation to all the independent directors for their approval. 
Mr. Izzo's salary, annual cash incentive and long-term incentive exceed that of the other NEOs due to his tenure in role, greater level of duties and responsibilities as the principal executive officer to whom the other NEOs report, and whom the Board holds fully accountable for the execution of corporate business plans. Executive compensation for 2018 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table reflects an improved balance and lower ratio in the comparison of CEO pay to the average pay of the other NEOs.

Base Salary 
Each NEO's base salary level is reviewed annually by the O&CC. 
The O&CC considers base salaries and salary adjustments for individual NEOs, other than the CEO, based on market data and: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recommendations of the CEO: Considering the respective NEO's level of responsibilities, experience in  position, performance results, and peer market data.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance metrics: Including achievement of financial targets, safety and operational results, customer  satisfaction, regulatory outcomes and other factors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additional factors: Leadership ability, managerial skills and other personal aptitudes and attributes. For  2018, the O&CC set the merit increase budget at 3%. When an executive is promoted into a new role, we do not necessarily bring him/her to median immediately. Instead, we will bring him/her to median over a multi-year period, which can lead to  annual salary increases greater than the budgeted merit increase. Conversely, long-tenured executives may exceed the median of peers due to experience and performance in their role.

Annual Cash Incentive 
Our NEO's are eligible for an annual cash incentive under our SMICP. Any payout is subject to achievement of applicable corporate, business unit, and strategic goals, as well as individual performance. The Corporate Factor for 2018 was Operating EPS (non-GAAP). We use Operating EPS (non-GAAP), which excludes mark-to-market activity, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) and other material one-time items. Management believes this provides a consistent comparison of earnings. While other companies' definitions of operating earnings may differ, most peers using EPS as a factor for annual cash incentive purposes are using non-GAAP EPS. 
The business unit earnings targets for 2018 for PSE&G and Power were based on non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), respectively. We used these non-GAAP measures because we believe they better reflect operating performance and more directly relate to ongoing operations of the businesses. PSE&G's non-GAAP Operating Earnings results are adjusted for variances between actual interest expense and the business plan. Power's non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as non-GAAP Operating Earnings, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We further adjusted Power's non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to exclude tax credit purchase costs which directly impact income tax expense. 
See Appendix A on pages 81-82 for reconciliation to GAAP of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. 
The SMICP was approved by stockholders. If appropriate, the Board will recommend for stockholder approval any material changes to the SMICP required to align the plan with our compensation objectives. The corporate-level goals and those for the CEO are developed by the O&CC with input from the entire Board. The goals and measures are established by the CEO for the NEOs reporting to him, and for each other participant by the individual to whom he/she reports. 
The SMICP sets a maximum award fund in any year of 2.5% of Net Income. The CEO's maximum award cannot exceed 10% of the award fund. The maximum award for each other participant cannot exceed 90% of the award fund divided by the number of participants, other than the CEO, for that year. For 2018 performance under the SMICP, these limits were $35,950,000 for the total award pool, $3,595,000 for the CEO's maximum award and $2,488,846 for each other participant's maximum award. Of the total award pool, $6,510,500 was awarded for 2018. 
Impact of Performance on Incentive Compensation 
Each NEO's incentive compensation is evaluated based on his/her achievement of specific performance goals relating to the Company's and the applicable business unit's earnings, a business unit scorecard and strategic goals. Mr. Izzo's incentive

Compensation Discussion and Analysis compensation is evaluated based on corporate earnings and corporate strategic goals. Messrs. LaRossa's and Daly's performance goals include a business unit (BU) earnings goal to more align their incentive compensation with their functional responsibilities. The incentive compensation for each of Messrs. Cregg, LaRossa, Daly and Ms. Linde was based in part on the achievement of BU scorecard metrics which are comprised of goals based on financial, operational and strategic performance of their respective business units. The focus is on performance and continuous improvement measured against benchmarked targets. 
All participants had strategic goals: for Mr. Izzo, operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, with multiple scorecard metrics and goals; for all NEOs, leadership visibility, continuous improvement and leading practices in support of strategic initiatives. Each NEO's performance under each applicable factor - corporate EPS, BU earnings, BU scorecard and strategic goals could range from zero to 2.0 (200%) based on the achievement of pre-determined goals.

NEOs, other officers as determined by the Committee and other key employees, as selected by the CEO within guidelines established by the O&CC, are eligible to participate in the LTIP. 
The LTIP, as amended and restated, was approved by our stockholders at the 2013 Annual Meeting. As noted below, the LTIP provides for different forms of equity awards: restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and stock options to achieve various objectives. The maximum number of shares that may be awarded under grants to any one individual under the LTIP is 500,000 during any calendar year. In general, since 2010, we have been granting only PSUs and RSUs. Our CEO is the only recipient of prior year LTIP awards who still holds stock options that have not expired. None of the NEOs have any outstanding restricted stock awards. The LTIP prohibits the repricing of stock options and the buy-out by us of underwater stock options for cash.

In general, when making LTIP grants, the O&CC considers the individual's prior LTIP awards as a reference point in applying these factors. The value of an executive's current holdings is not a consideration, though it is reviewed periodically by the O&CC. With respect to the CEO, the O&CC develops a recommended award opportunity in consultation with CAP and submits the proposal to the Board. Grants are typically made each February. 
RSUs are denominated in units of Common Stock and cliff vest at the end of three years. However, for retirement eligible employees, RSUs vest one-twelfth for each month of service beginning in the year of the grant of the RSUs and are fully vested at the end of that year. RSUs are payable in shares of our Common Stock at the end of the three-year period. PSUs are denominated in units of Common Stock and are subject to achievement of certain performance goals over a three-year period. PSUs are payable as determined by us in shares of our Common Stock. PSUs vest at the end of the performance period. However, for retirement eligible employees, PSUs vest one-thirty sixth for each month of service beginning in the year of the grant of the PSUs and are fully vested at the end of the performance period. Unvested RSUs and PSUs are forfeited upon retirement or termination of service. Any PSU payments are made following the conclusion of the performance period.

Impact of Company Performance on Prior Year's Performance Awards 
LTIP awards of PSUs made for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018 were reported in our Proxy Statements (other than for Mr. Daly who was not an NEO at the time of such report) at fair value at the time of the grants. These PSU grants were subject to the achievement of goals related to relative TSR and absolute and relative ROIC. 
Based on the performance results for that period, as approved by the O&CC, Messrs. Izzo, Cregg, LaRossa and Daly and Ms. Linde will receive payment in 2019 of shares of our Common Stock equal to 127% (see table below) of the grant target amounts. Although Mr. Daly was not an NEO at the time he received his LTIP award in February 2016, we have included his payout in 2019 for the performance period. 
These PSUs are earned on three metrics, including ROIC vs. plan (which we eliminated as a metric in grants made in subsequent years). We determine ROIC by dividing Net Income (adjusted for interest expense, excluding amounts related to securitized debt) by debt and equity (adjusted for securitized debt). In determining actual results, we adjusted ROIC vs. plan for compensation purposes to exclude from results the impact of the early retirement and sale of our Hudson and Mercer coal/gas units and charges related to certain Energy Holdings leveraged leases. We also adjusted our ROIC vs. plan to exclude the impacts of the federal tax legislation signed into effect in December 2017 that was not factored into our 2016 plan targets. We did not make these adjustments in measuring ROIC vs. peers. 
The performance schedule for relative TSR, which comprises 40% of this PSU grant award, is based on the relative rank within the peer group. Shown below are the ranks and payout factors at threshold, target and maximum levels and our actual rank for this period:

2018 Grants 
The structure of the long-term incentive is consistent with the prior grants as described above, in the form of 70% PSUs and 30% RSUs vesting at the end of three years. The greater emphasis on PSUs places more of our NEOs' potential compensation payouts at risk. 
The grants included in our Summary Compensation Table were approved in February 2018 for the NEOs. These grants are for the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2020 and are shown in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. These awards are also reported in the Summary Compensation Table at the grant date fair value. Payouts, if any, will be based on TSR vs. peers and ROIC vs. peers and will be disclosed when the applicable performance period is completed. 
2018 Retention Award 
As described above in the CD&A, a primary goal of our executive compensation program is to attract, retain and reward exceptional talent. Led by our CEO and under the guidance of our Board and with the advice of our compensation consultant, we extensively review our talent and succession plans. In particular, we evaluate retention of executives with a demonstrated track-record of superior performance in light of responsible succession planning and the roles that key individuals play in the future success of the Company. Accordingly, in February 2018, in connection with his election to President and COO of Power in October 2017, Mr. LaRossa was awarded a retention grant having a target value of $3,000,000. This retention award was granted concurrently with our 2018 annual LTIP awards in equal amounts of PSUs and RSUs. The PSUs and RSUs will vest in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and are not subject to acceleration of vesting for retirement eligibility or retirement. The PSUs and RSUs shall vest upon Mr. LaRossa's death or disability, upon involuntary termination without cause or in the event that Mr. LaRossa is terminated, whether voluntary or involuntary, in connection with a change in leadership. The RSUs shall vest in the event that Mr. LaRossa is terminated, whether voluntary or involuntary, upon change in control and the PSUs shall vest upon a change in control. These provisions differ from our standard grant provisions to address the specific objectives of this retention award. 
Deferred Compensation Plans 
We offer a deferred compensation plan to our officers, so they can more effectively manage their personal tax obligations. Participants may elect to defer all or any portion of their cash compensation and may choose from among several different investment options based upon the choices available in our 401(k) Plan (except the Company Stock Fund and the Fidelity Brokerage Link Account), as well as a market-based rate of Prime plus 1/2%, capped at 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate. 
54    PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
We also have a plan that provides officers with the opportunity to defer equity compensation. Generally, the election to defer shares underlying an equity award must be made before the services giving rise to the equity award are performed. Deferred shares are held in a Rabbi Trust. 
Additional details about these deferred compensation plans are provided in the descriptions following the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
Perquisites 
We provide certain perquisites that we believe are reasonably within compensation practices of our peers or provide benefit to us, such as providing an appropriate degree of personal security to executives with a high public profile and allowing the executive to be productive while commuting. These include an automobile use (and for the CEO, a driver) stipend, parking, reimbursement of relocation expenses, annual physical examinations, limited personal and spousal travel, including use of aircraft (in accordance with the policy we have established and with CEO approval), home security, limited personal technology, charitable contributions on behalf of the individual, limited club memberships, limited credit card annual fees and limited personal entertainment. These perquisites are described in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, as applicable. 
We do not provide a tax gross-up of personal benefit amounts deemed to be taxable income under federal or state income tax laws and regulations, except for certain relocation expenses, primarily in the case of newly-hired executives. 
Retirement Benefits 
All employees, including the NEOs, receive certain qualified retirement benefits under the Pension Plan of PSEG (Pension Plan), which provides either a traditional defined benefit pension (Final Average Pay Component) or a cash balance defined benefit pension (Cash Balance Component). The nature of the individual's Pension Plan benefit depends upon the date of hire. Messrs. Izzo, Cregg, LaRossa and Daly and Ms. Linde participate in the Final Average Pay Component as they each began employment before January 1, 1996. 
In addition to the qualified plan, we provide certain nonqualified retirement benefits under the Retirement Income Reinstatement Plan (Reinstatement Plan) and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Income Plan (Supplemental Plan). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Reinstatement Plan is an unfunded non-qualified retirement plan that  provides retirement benefits that would have been paid under our qualified retirement plan but for the limitations of the IRC which caps the amount of an employee's compensation that may be considered for qualified plan purposes. All employees  who are affected by the compensation limit are eligible to participate in this plan. SMICP amounts and deferred amounts are also included in computing benefits under this plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Supplemental Plan is an unfunded non-qualified retirement benefit plan  that provides supplemental limited retirement and death benefits to participants nominated by the CEO and designated by our Employee Benefits Policy Committee. It also provides retirement benefits based upon additional credited years of service for  prior allied professional or industrial experience to employees selected by the CEO. In 2011, the O&CC determined that we will no longer offer any additional years of credited service under the Supplemental Plan to individuals not previously  provided with that benefit.  
[END TABLE]
All of our NEOs participate in the Reinstatement Plan and Messrs. Izzo and LaRossa participate in the additional limited benefit provisions of the Supplemental Plan. As described in the Pension Benefits Table, Mr. Izzo is eligible to receive additional years of credited service. 
Additional information is provided in the Pension Benefits Table and the accompanying narrative, below. Amounts reported for 2018 reflect changes in the discount rate, as well as actuarial changes, which impacted the benefit calculations. 
We also maintain a defined contribution 401(k) Plan and provide a partial employer matching contribution for 401(k) Plan participants. We provide retirees with the opportunity to receive medical benefits with a subsidy available to participants in the Final Average Pay Component of the Pension Plan who meet the eligibility requirements. 
Severance and Change-In-Control Benefits 
We provide severance benefits in the event of certain employment terminations. These benefits are available to officers, including the NEOs, in order to be competitive with the companies in our industry and provide a level of financial security to the executive in periods of uncertainty in the event of a termination without cause. All of our NEOs participate in our Key Executive Severance Plan. Mr. Izzo is also eligible for certain other severance benefits, as described under Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change-In-Control. 
We provide severance benefits upon a change-in-control to officers. A change-in-control is by its nature disruptive to an organization and its executives. Executives are frequently key players in the success of organizational change. To assure the continuing performance of such executives and maintain stability and continuity in the face of a possible termination of 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    55 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis employment in the event of a change-in-control, we provide a competitive severance package. In addition, some executives, who may be key parties to such transaction, may have their employment terminated following its completion. 
Neither our Key Executive Severance Plan nor Mr. Izzo's severance agreement provide for gross-up payments from us in the event that any NEO or other participant is subject to an excise tax related to receipt of a change-in-control payment. Both the Key Executive Severance Plan and Mr. Izzo's severance agreement include a "double-trigger" provision on benefits, which are paid only in the event of termination of employment following a change-in-control. Performance share unit payments, if any, are prorated. No benefits are paid in the event of a termination for cause. 
Severance and change-in-control benefits are described under Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change-in-Control. 
Executive Compensation Governance Features and Controls 
Independent Compensation Consultant 
The O&CC has retained CAP to provide information, analyses and advice regarding executive and director compensation. CAP reports directly to the O&CC and the O&CC has established procedures that it considers adequate to ensure that CAP's advice is objective and not influenced by management. These procedures include an agreement specifying what information can and cannot be shared with management. In addition, CAP regularly meets with the O&CC in executive session, without the presence of management. CAP provides only executive compensation consulting services. This consisted of analysis and advice about our executive compensation program including our peer group, pay for performance alignment and disclosure in this CD&A. For additional information see page 17. 
In the course of conducting its services, CAP attended four meetings of the O&CC in 2018 and presented its findings and recommendations for discussion. 
Management also retains a compensation consultant, Pay Governance, to provide market compensation data for our officers, including the NEOs. This data is made available to CAP. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
In 2018, CAP, in consultation with management, reviewed our compensation programs to assess the potential of whether they encourage individuals to take excessive risks. The risk assessment included a full inventory of all incentive compensation plans in the organization, including their design, metrics, goals and operation and a review of business and operational risks and governance and oversight practices and internal controls. Our Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, as well as our internal compensation professionals under the supervision of our Senior Vice President—Human Resources, participated in this process. Management and CAP reviewed this assessment with the O&CC. In addition, final decisions regarding our executive compensation policies and programs, as well as specific approval of individual NEO compensation, are determined by the O&CC, and, as appropriate, the full Board. Based on this review, the O&CC determined that the programs are appropriately structured and do not create an incentive for individuals to take excessive risks which are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on us.

Role of CEO 
The CEO attends O&CC meetings, other than executive sessions. The CEO recommends changes to the salaries of his direct reports (who include the NEOs). The CEO develops and the O&CC considers these recommendations in the context of the respective executives' individual performance, experience in role, competitiveness of salary and internal equity among executives. The CEO recommends incentive compensation targets (expressed as a percentage of base salary) for the SMICP and LTIP grants for his direct reports as well as the associated goals, objectives and performance evaluations. The CEO participates in the O&CC's discussions of those recommendations. 
The CEO reviews the design and effectiveness of compensation policies and programs and the analyses and recommendations of CAP in light of general industry practices and in comparison to the peer group trends. The CEO also reviews such compensation matters with our internal compensation professionals. Recommendations for changes are made to the O&CC as deemed appropriate by the CEO. The O&CC believes that the role played by the CEO in this process is appropriate because the CEO is uniquely suited to evaluate the performance of his direct reports. 
Standards of Conduct 
Our Standards set expectations of behavior in line with our commitment to adhere to the highest ethical standards and along with our Compliance Program, Related Person Transactions Practice and Conflicts of Interest Practice establish policies and procedures regarding personal and business conduct. The Audit Committee of the Board has oversight of our legal and business conduct compliance. 
Hedging and Pledging 
We have a policy that prohibits all employees, including NEOs and other officers, and directors, from hedging, short-selling or pledging our Common Stock. 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    57 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Trading Pre-clearance 
Under our Insider Trading Practice, all of our officers, including the NEOs, are required to obtain pre-clearance from the Office of the General Counsel prior to engaging in any transaction involving our Common Stock. In addition, our Insider Trading Practice does not permit any such transactions except during "open window" periods or pursuant to pre-established plans. These are limited times following the public release of earnings and disclosure of material information. 
Clawbacks 
We have codified our policies/practices into a Clawback Practice with a three-year look-back, which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Applies to all incentive compensation for all non-represented employees;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Applies in the event of (i) a restatement of financial statements, or (ii) recalculation of incentive  compensation, in each case resulting from the employee's misconduct, or (iii) an employee's act or omission which constitutes a material violation of our Standards that results or would have resulted in termination of employment; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Is administered by the O&CC as to officer compensation.  
[END TABLE]
We revised this Clawback Practice in February 2018 to cover violations that would have resulted in termination had we known them prior to the end of employment. 
Actual grants may contain additional provisions, such as recoupment for violations of non-compete, non-solicitation or confidentiality agreements. We anticipate adjusting the terms of our Clawback Practice as may be needed to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act once final guidance is released from the SEC. 
Employment Agreements 
We have entered into a severance agreement with Mr. Izzo. This is discussed following the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Policy 
In order to strengthen the alignment of the interests of management with those of stockholders, we have established a Stock Ownership and Retention Policy (Policy) applicable to selected officers, including the NEOs. Each officer must maintain ownership of a sufficient number of shares of our Common Stock having a market value equal to the applicable prescribed multiple of such officer's annual base salary. The required amount must be acquired within five years.

The Senior Vice President - Human Resources reports annually to the O&CC on the status of each officer's compliance with the Policy. In the event an officer is not in compliance with any provision of the Policy, the O&CC may take such action as it deems appropriate, consistent with the provisions of our compensation plans and applicable law and regulations, to enable the officer to achieve compliance at the earliest practicable time or otherwise enforce the Policy. Such action may include establishing conditions with respect to requiring all or part of any SMICP or LTIP award to be held in shares. The O&CC may vary the application of the provisions of the Policy for good cause or exceptional circumstances. 
Messrs. Izzo, Cregg, and LaRossa, and Ms. Linde each have met their respective requirement. Mr. Daly was elected to his current position in October 2017 and has until January 2023 to meet his ownership requirement.

Effective for 2018, we increased the percentage of ownership required for the CEO and certain other executive officers and eliminated for all, the requirement to retain until retirement or termination of employment 25% of shares that vest after the ownership level is reached. This action was taken after benchmarking against peers and leading practices.

The O&CC has considered the effect of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (see Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K) regarding the expensing of equity awards in determining the nature of the grants under the LTIP. 
The O&CC considers the tax-deductibility of our compensation payments as one factor in determining executive compensation. In addition, the O&CC considers other factors in making decisions, as noted in this CD&A, and retains the flexibility to award compensation consistent with our compensation philosophy and program in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders even if not deductible. IRC Section 162(m) generally denies a deduction for United States federal income tax purposes for compensation in excess of $1 million for the CEO and certain other persons named in the proxy statement. At the time that the O&CC made its decisions as to the 2016 and 2017 incentive awards, an exemption existed for PSUs granted under the LTIP, as qualifying performance-based compensation pursuant to stockholder-approved plans. 
However, due to adjustments we made for the performance criteria for the PSUs granted in 2016, we expect the payouts of those awards will not be deductible. In addition, effective for 2018, the Section 162(m) exemption applicable for qualifying plans was repealed in the federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017, except for certain arrangements in place on November 2, 2017. We believe that PSUs granted in 2017 will be deductible but that SMICP amounts earned for 2018 and the PSUs awarded in 2018 will not be deductible. In 2018, a portion of the compensation reported in this Proxy Statement exceeded the limit and is not deductible.

Material Factors Concerning Awards Shown in Summary Compensation Table, Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and Employment Agreements 
SMICP 
The plan-based awards for annual cash incentive compensation included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table were paid in 2019 with respect to 2018 performance under the terms of the SMICP. The range of possible awards for each NEO in relation to his/her target award is set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. An explanation of the SMICP and performance goals, measures and performance factors achieved are described under Annual Cash Incentive in the CD&A. 
LTIP 
LTIP awards were made to NEOs in February 2018 in the form of RSUs and PSUs. The RSUs cliff vest after three years. The three-year performance period for the PSUs ends December 31, 2020, with payment, if any, made the following year. As explained in the CD&A, for retirement eligible employees, RSUs vest 1/12th per month in the year awarded and PSUs vest 1/36th per month over the three-year performance period. The range of possible payouts for each NEO in relation to his/her target award is set forth in the table above. Payments of awards granted in February 2016 will be made in 2019 based on performance for the three-year period that ended on December 31, 2018. Further explanation of PSU payment determination is set forth under Long-Term Incentive in the CD&A. For further information about vesting for Mr. LaRossa's 2018 retention award please refer to page 54. For additional information about vesting, see Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change-In-Control. 
No stock options have been granted since 2009. Some options granted in previous years are still outstanding as reported in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Year-End Table. Grants were made with an exercise price equal to the NYSE closing price on the date of grant for a ten-year term. No discounted options may be granted and no repricings may be done without stockholders' approval. 
Employment Agreements 
The CEO and each NEO receive an annual salary review and participate in the SMICP, LTIP, Reinstatement Plan and Key Executive Severance Plan. Mr. Izzo has entered into a severance agreement, the terms of which are discussed below under Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change-in-Control. Messrs. Izzo and LaRossa participate in the Supplemental Plan.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  PSUs in the table above are shown at target. PSUs awarded under the LTIP are earned based on a three-year  performance period. Payment, if any, is made in the first quarter of the year following the end of the performance period. The vesting schedule below shows the number of unvested PSUs at target and maximum and includes accrued dividend equivalents.  Each of the NEOs is retirement eligible. PSUs for retirement eligible NEOs vest 1/36th in their awards each month over the three-year performance period. The amounts shown for those individuals  represent 12/36th of their 2017 awards that vest in 2019, 12/36th of their 2018 awards that vest in 2019 and 12/36th of their 2018 awards that vest in 2020. The vesting schedule also includes Mr. LaRossa's 2018 retention award which vests as described in the CD&A. All such amounts are summed in the  total. For further explanation of PSUs, see the CD&A.

(2)  The table above shows the total payout value distributed for each of the NEOs for the 2016 grants based on the  results of the three-year performance period and our Common Stock price, as described further in the CD&A. Each NEO became retirement eligible prior to 2018. Under the LTIP, PSUs vest one-thirty sixth per  month of service for retirement eligible participants. We show below for each NEO the number of PSUs, including accrued dividend equivalents, at both target and maximum values, that vested in 2018 with respect to their 2017 and 2018 grants. No  dollar values are shown for these as payouts, if any, are dependent on the actual results of the performance metrics and applicable stock prices for the respective performance periods. The number of PSUs, including dividend equivalents, earned, if  any, will be determined at the conclusion of the applicable performance periods and reported in the relevant proxy statements. PSUs under Mr. LaRossa's retention award are not included, as they are not subject to retirement eligible  vesting.

Executive Compensation 
Qualified and Non-Qualified Pension Plans 
All of our employees are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan in either the Final Average Pay Component or the Cash Balance Component, depending upon date of hire. 
Final Average Pay Component 
The Final Average Pay Component covers non-represented employees hired prior to January 1, 1996 and represented employees hired prior to January 1, 1997 and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement (age 65) pursuant to a formula based upon (a) the participant's number of years of service and (b) the average of the participant's five or seven highest years of compensation up to the limit imposed by the IRC. We amended the Final Average Pay Component effective January 1, 2012, to change the benefit formula for non-represented participants. The effect of the change is to reduce projected pension payments. Under the new formula, the average of the participant's seven highest years of compensation up to the limit imposed by the IRC will be used rather than the average of the participant's five highest years of compensation. 
A participant's benefit under the Final Average Pay Component is equal to A plus B: 
A. The accrued benefit calculated under the five-year final average pay formula as of December 31, 2011, as follows: 
(i) 1.3% of the lesser of 5-year final average earnings (determined as of December 31, 2011) or $24,600 times years of credited service (determined as of December 31, 2011) not exceeding 35 years; 
(ii) 1.5% of the amount by which 5-year final average earnings (determined as of December 31, 2011) exceeds $24,600 times years of credited service not exceeding 35 years; and 
(iii) 1.5% of 5-year final average earnings times years of credited service (determined as of December 31, 2011) in excess of 35 years. 
B. The accrued benefit calculated under the seven-year final average pay formula, as follows: 
(i) 1.3% of the lesser of 7-year final average earnings beginning on January 1, 2012 or $24,600 times years of credited service not exceeding 35 years less the number of years as of December 31, 2011; 
(ii) 1.5% of the amount by which 7-year final average earnings beginning on January 1, 2012 exceeds $24,600 times years of credited service not exceeding 35 years less the number of years as of December 31, 2011; and 
(iii) 1.5% of 7-year final average earnings times years of credited service in excess of 35 years less the number of years in excess of 35 years as of December 31, 2011. 
An additional benefit equal to $4.00 per month (effective January 1, 2018, $5.00 per month for represented employees) for each year of credited service is payable until the retiree reaches age 65. 
All active participants are fully vested in their Final Average Pay Component benefit. Benefits are payable on an unreduced basis (i) at age 65, (ii) at age 60, if the participant's age, plus years of service, equals or exceeds 80 or (iii) at age 55, if the participant has 25 or more years of service. Participants whose age, plus years of service, equals or exceeds 80, but who have not yet met the criteria in (ii) or (iii) may commence their Final Average Pay Component benefits on a reduced basis.

Executive Compensation 
Cash Balance Component 
The Cash Balance Component covers non-represented employees hired or rehired after December 31, 1995 and represented employees hired after December 31,1996 and provides each participant with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement (age 65) equal to the actuarial equivalent of a notional amount maintained for him/her. Participants are eligible for retirement under the Cash Balance Component upon the attainment of age 55 with five or more years of service. Participants' accounts are credited each year with a percentage of compensation, which is determined based on the participant's age plus years of service measured at year-end.

[END TABLE]
Each participant's notional amount grows each year with interest credits based on a 6.0% annual rate of interest. Participants become immediately fully vested in their Cash Balance Component benefit. 
Reinstatement Plan 
Certain management and highly compensated employees participate in a nonqualified excess benefit retirement plan, the Reinstatement Plan, designed to replace earned pension benefits as determined under the Pension Plan formula, but which cannot be paid from the Pension Plan as a result of the IRC mandated limits for qualified plans or the terms of the Pension Plan. The benefits payable under this plan mirror those of the Pension Plan described above except that the compensation considered in computing the benefit (i) will not be limited by qualified plan limits, (ii) will include any amounts that the participant deferred under deferred compensation plan, (iii) will include amounts earned under the SMICP and, as applicable, the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (which are not considered under the Pension Plan), (iv) will be limited to 150% of average base salary for the applicable five or seven years for Final Average Pay Component participants and will be limited to 150% of base salary each year for Cash Balance Component participants and (v) will be offset by any benefits received by the participant under the Pension Plan (Final Average Pay Component or Cash Balance Component). 
Supplemental Plan 
Certain employees receive supplemental limited retirement and death benefits in a nonqualified plan, the Supplemental Plan. In addition, certain employees receive additional years of service for the purpose of retirement benefit calculations in recognition of prior allied work experience. However, we have determined, effective January 1, 2011, to no longer offer additional credited service to those who do not already have this benefit. Such benefits are paid from the Supplemental Plan. Benefits payable under the additional service provisions of the Supplemental Plan mirror those payable under the Reinstatement Plan, except that the additional years of service are considered in calculating the Supplemental Plan benefit amount. Any benefit payable under the Supplemental Plan is offset by benefits payable under the Pension Plan and the Reinstatement Plan. 
Certain participants in the Supplemental Plan receive additional limited benefits. This portion of the Supplemental Plan provides a total target replacement income percentage equal to credited service for qualified pension plan calculation purposes, plus any applicable additional credited service, plus 30, to a maximum of 75%, of an average of covered compensation. Covered compensation used for determining limited benefits under the Supplemental Plan is the same as the covered compensation used under the Reinstatement Plan. The target replacement amount under the limited benefit portion of the Supplemental Plan is reduced by any pension benefits from any previous employers accrued and vested at the time of hire, by the participant's Social Security benefit at normal retirement age and by the pension benefits provided by each other PSEG retirement benefit plan (qualified plans and non-qualified plans). The additional limited benefits provision of the Supplemental Plan also provides a death benefit equal to 150% of base compensation if death occurs while the participant is actively employed. Participants designated for the additional limited benefit become entitled to this benefit only upon (a) retirement under the terms of the component of the Pension Plan in which they participate (Final Average Pay Component or Cash Balance Component), or (b) death. 
PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement    69 
Executive Compensation 
The change in the benefit formula under the qualified Final Average Pay Component from a five-year final average pay formula to a seven-year final average pay formula impacts the limited benefits under the Supplemental Plan. Accordingly, we amended the Supplemental Plan as of January 1, 2012 to reflect this change.

Deferred Compensation 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants, including the NEOs, may elect to defer any portion of their cash compensation by making appropriate elections in the calendar year prior to the year in which the services giving rise to the compensation being deferred are rendered. A participant may change an election to defer compensation not later than the date that is the last date that an election to defer may be made. 
At the same time he/she elects to defer compensation, the participant must make an election as to the timing and the form of distribution of that year's deferrals from his/her Deferred Compensation Plan account. For compensation deferred in 2011 and earlier years distribution may commence (a) on the thirtieth day after the date he/she terminates employment or, in the alternative, (b) on January 15th of any calendar year following termination of employment elected by him/her, but in any event no later than the later of (i) the January of the year following the year of his/her 70th birthday or (ii) the January following termination of employment. Notwithstanding the forgoing, however, for NEOs and other specified employees, distribution of his/her account may not occur earlier than six months following the date of his/her termination of service. Participants may elect to receive the distribution of their Deferred Compensation account in the form of one lump-sum payment, annual distributions over a five-year period or annual distributions over a 10-year period. 
With respect to compensation deferred in 2012 and future years, participants may elect to commence distribution of a particular year's deferrals (a) six months following his/her termination of employment, or (b) a specified number of years following his/her termination from employment. Participants may elect to receive distribution of such deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan in the form of a lump-sum payment or annual distributions over a period of three to fifteen years. 
70    PSEG 2019 Proxy Statement 
Executive Compensation 
Under the scheduled future date distribution feature, participants may elect to receive a specific plan year's deferral balance on a specified date as early as three years after the beginning of the year in which the deferrals are made. Distributions are paid in a lump sum within 90 days from the date elected regardless of whether the participant is employed by us on the payment date. 
Participants may change their distribution elections as to future year's deferrals. Participants may also make changes of their distribution elections with respect to prior years' deferrals provided that (a) any such new distribution election is made at least one year prior to the previously selected commencement date or (b) the new commencement date is at least five years later than the previously selected commencement date. 
Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings based on (a) the performance of one or more of the investment portfolio funds available to employees under our 401(k) plans (except the Company Stock Fund and the Fidelity Brokerage Link Account) or (b) at the rate of Prime plus 1/2%, capped at 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, in such percentages as selected by the participant. A participant who fails to provide a designation of investment funds will accrue earnings on his/her account at the rate of Prime plus 1/2%, capped at 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate. A participant may change his/her investment election on a daily basis.

Equity Deferral Plan 
Participants in our Equity Deferral Plan may defer receipt of all or a portion of the shares of our Common Stock underlying future equity awards under the LTIP. Deferral elections must be made during an annual enrollment period prior to the date that services giving rise to the awards are performed. Deferral elections under the Equity Deferral Plan are irrevocable. 
Generally, at the time a participant elects to defer he/she must make an election as to the timing of payment of the deferred shares. Distributions will be made in a lump sum. Distributions may commence (a) on a specified date occurring between the third anniversary and the fifteenth anniversary of the date that the shares otherwise would have been distributed to the participant (b) upon termination of employment, or (c) the earlier of (a) and (b). Notwithstanding the forgoing, however, for NEOs and other specified employees, distribution may not occur earlier than six months following the date of his/her termination of employment. Participants will receive shares on the applicable distribution date. We hold the deferred shares in a Rabbi Trust. The dividends attributable to the deferred shares are reinvested in Common Stock and distributed at the same time that the deferred shares are distributed to the participants. Participants are not permitted to direct the trustee of the Rabbi Trust to vote the deferred shares.

Executive Compensation 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL 
Termination without Cause 
Mr. Izzo's severance agreement provides for certain benefits if he is terminated without "cause" (a willful failure to perform his duties) or resigns for "good reason" (a reduction in pay, position or authority) during the term of such agreement. He would be paid a benefit of two times base salary and target bonus, as well as a prorated payment of SMICP target incentive award for the year of termination. His welfare benefits would be continued for two years, unless he is sooner employed. Any unvested equity awards would be forfeited. The agreement provides that Mr. Izzo will be prohibited from competing with and from recruiting employees from us or our subsidiaries or affiliates, for certain periods after termination of employment. Violations of these provisions require a forfeiture of certain benefits. 
Our Key Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits to Messrs. Izzo, Cregg, LaRossa and Daly and Ms. Linde, and to certain of our other key executive-level employees whose employment is terminated without cause. Participants must agree to restrictive covenants including confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation. Termination for cause includes certain violations of our performance, behavioral and value expectations for executives. 
Also under the Key Executive Severance Plan, Messrs. Cregg, LaRossa and Daly and Ms. Linde would be entitled to certain severance benefits in the event that their employment was terminated without cause other than in a change-in-control situation. In such event they would be entitled to 1.0 times their annual base salary plus their target bonus, as well as a prorated payment of their SMICP target incentive award for the year of termination and certain outplacement services, educational assistance, health care and life insurance coverage. The Key Executive Severance Plan further provides that any unvested equity awards would be accelerated or forfeited in accordance with the terms of the individual's grants under the LTIP and/or employment agreement. 
In accordance with Mr. LaRossa's retention award, upon termination, voluntary or involuntary, following a change in leadership, Mr. LaRossa would become fully vested in his retention award as described in the CD&A on page 54. 
Assuming a termination without cause or for a reduction in force or reorganization had occurred on December 31, 2018, each of the NEOs would have received the following benefits as a lump sum payment:

Executive Compensation 
PAY RATIO 
We have calculated the ratio of our CEO's compensation to that of our median employee. In doing so, we reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 to that of all other employees in 2018, using the same methodology and elements of compensation as we used in determining the total compensation shown for our CEO in the Summary Compensation Table that appears on page 60. Our calculation is based on the same median employee previously identified for our 2018 proxy statement disclosure and includes all employees as of December 31, 2017. There have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. The median employee was determined using internal payroll records of income reported on IRS Form W-2, which is a consistently applied compensation measure, as provided by the applicable SEC provisions. We believe that the pay ratio shown below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with those provisions. We note that our calculation does not include all elements of our employee compensation package, such as health insurances and other benefits generally applicable to all employees. 
For 2018, for purposes of this pay ratio disclosure, the compensation of our median employee was $133,067 and the compensation of our CEO was $10,419,291. The ratio of CEO to median employee pay was approximately 78:1.

Ratification of Auditor 
The Audit Committee of the Board, each member of which is independent, has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP of Parsippany, NJ, as independent auditor to make the annual audit of our books of account and supporting records for 2019, subject to the ratification of the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. The responsibilities of the independent auditor include performing an audit of, and expressing an opinion on, our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting as well as discussing with the Audit Committee any matters deemed appropriate.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhanced audit quality due to a deep understanding of our business, accounting policy and practices and internal  controls,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Efficient fee structures due to experience and a familiarity with our company and industry expertise; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

OVERSIGHT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
The appointment, termination, compensation and oversight of the quality of the work of the Independent Registered Public Accountants, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent auditor, is the direct responsibility of the Audit Committee of our Board, which reviews its independence, the services provided and its fees, the selection of the lead engagement partner, as well as Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and peer review reports of its performance. The Audit Committee meets with the independent auditors and discusses the audit and as necessary any issues that may be encountered in connection with the audit. Additional information about the Audit Committee appears above in Proposal 1 Election of Directors-Board Committee Responsibilities on page 14. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews the independence and performance of Deloitte & Touche LLP in connection with the Committee's determination as to whether to retain that firm or engage another as our independent auditor. Among other things, it considers various safeguards for auditor independence, including regulatory requirements and limits on non-audit services. Under applicable accounting requirements, there is a mandatory rotation of the lead engagement partner every five years. The current lead engagement partner was appointed in 2018. In evaluating Deloitte & Touche, LLP, the Committee considers, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Quality of work and performance, both recent and historical;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Professional qualifications, capabilities and expertise;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Level and appropriateness of fees;

Ratification of Auditor 
Pre-Approval of Services 
Annually, in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee reviews, in detail, the particular services in each of the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other categories that the independent auditor will perform subject to predetermined limits set by the Audit Committee for each category of service. The annual pre-approval of services and predetermined limits is documented in a Committee resolution. 
During the year, circumstances may arise when it becomes necessary to engage the independent registered public accountants for additional services not contemplated in the annual Committee resolution. For those instances, the Chairman of the Committee has been authorized by the Audit Committee to approve Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other in excess of the amounts and different from the types of service authorized in the Committee resolution, as well as the scope and amount of services with regard to the annual audit that may be necessary or advisable provided that any such authorizations are reported to the Audit Committee at the next meeting following such authorization. 
Fees Billed by Deloitte & Touche LLP for 2018 and 2017 
The fees billed by Deloitte & Touche LLP are negotiated by management under the direction of the CFO, with the oversight and ultimate approval of the Audit Committee. The table below shows the fees paid to Deloitte and Touche LLP for Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services during or in connection with 2018 and 2017, all of which were approved, as described above.

Ratification of Auditor 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the PSEG Board of Directors is comprised solely of independent directors. It operates under a written charter adopted by the PSEG Board of Directors which is posted on PSEG's website, https://corporate.pseg.com/aboutpseg/leadershipandgovernance/boardofdirectors/committeedescriptions. The Audit Committee Charter is annually reviewed and assessed for adequacy by the PSEG Audit Committee. 
Management is responsible for PSEG's financial statements and internal controls. The independent auditor of PSEG, Deloitte & Touche LLP, reports directly to the PSEG Audit Committee and is responsible for performing an independent audit of PSEG's annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) (U.S.) and on PSEG's internal controls and for issuing reports thereon. The Audit Committee's overall responsibility is to assist the PSEG Board of Directors in overseeing the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. 
Management has represented to the Audit Committee that PSEG's Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. In performance of its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed PSEG's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and discussed these financial statements with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditor. 
The Committee periodically meets in executive session with the independent auditor, the Vice President - Internal Auditing Services, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer. At all of its meetings (except those held telephonically) the Audit Committee meets in executive session with only Audit Committee members present. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditor: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSEG's critical accounting policies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New accounting standards and policies affecting PSEG;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• That there were no disagreements with management over the application of GAAP;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant accounting estimates made by management and the disclosures in the financial statements;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accounting and reporting for significant transactions; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The other matters required to be discussed as described in PCAOB Auditing Standards No.16 Communications with Audit  Committees, which relate to the audit, financial statements, significant risks and critical accounting estimates, among others.  
[END TABLE]
The independent auditor also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by the PCAOB's standards in PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committee Concerning Independence, and current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for auditor independence. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditor the firm's independence with respect to PSEG, internal quality control procedures, and any material issues raised and any steps taken to deal with such issues by the most recent internal quality control review or by any review, inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years, with respect to one or more independent audits carried out by the firm. The Audit Committee has also reviewed the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to auditor independence and has defined the amount and scope of services that may be performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP consistent with maintaining that firm's independence. The Audit Committee requires that all services of Deloitte & Touche LLP be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chair. The Audit Committee has considered whether the independent auditor's provision of non-audit services to PSEG and the total fees paid for non-audit services relative to fees paid for audit services are compatible with maintaining the independent auditor's independence. On the basis of its review, the Audit Committee determined that the independent auditor has the requisite independence. 
Based on the Audit Committee's discussions with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditor, the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements, the representations of management to the independent auditor regarding the audited financial statements and the independent auditor's report to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in PSEG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

Management uses Operating Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) in addition to its Net Income reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Operating Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that differ from Net Income. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA excludes the same items as our non-GAAP Operating Earnings measure as well as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. 
Management uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG's financial performance to previous financial results. Management believes non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. Management also believes that non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure operating performance without regard to items such as income tax expense, interest expense and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon, among other things, the book value of assets, capital structure and whether assets were constructed or acquired. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA also allows investors and other users to assess the underlying financial performance of our fleet before management's decision to deploy capital. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to, the presentation of Net Income, which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as presented in the tables above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
