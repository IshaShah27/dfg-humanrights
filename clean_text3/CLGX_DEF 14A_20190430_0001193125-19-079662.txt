We delivered strong operating and financial results in 2018 despite significant US mortgage market headwinds. In the face of these headwinds, we reduced our overall cost structure by more than $20 million through productivity initiatives and cost management, continued to invest in future growth and productivity initiatives, and completed targeted acquisitions to enhance our business mix by increasing our non-mortgage and international footprints while driving higher technology platform revenues. We invested in next generation technology capabilities focusing on data structures and visualization, technology platforms, and advanced automation techniques, which we expect will set a foundation for future growth and margin expansion. Finally, we enhanced our infrastructure capabilities as we initiated our migration to the Google Cloud platform. 
Notable financial accomplishments in 2018 include:

• Significant market outperformance as our 2018 revenues were down 3%, as compared with a 15% estimated drop in overall US  mortgage market unit volumes.

 STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM 
The Board and executive management are committed to engaging with our stockholders. Throughout the year, executive management proactively and consistently meets with current and prospective stockholders to discuss our strategic priorities, operational performance, and financial results. Also, through these discussions or separate outreach efforts, we seek to engage our top stockholders to solicit feedback on corporate governance, our compensation program, and related matters. In 2018, we conducted such outreach to our top stockholders representing a majority of our outstanding shares; these stockholders did not express concerns over our corporate governance practices or compensation program design. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
We Pay for Performance. Our philosophy is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified executive officers critical to our long-term success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward executive officers for achieving pre-defined rigorous financial goals and  strategic objectives that may not yield current-period financial results but are expected to position us for enhanced results in future periods;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• encourage strategic long-term development and profitable investment in the  business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• motivate and reward appropriate risk-taking to grow the business; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• support pay practices with strong corporate governance and independent board oversight.  
[END TABLE]
We aligned annual incentives to rigorous financial targets. The Company's underlying pay-for-performance approach is intended to reward management appropriately in light of below- and above-expected performance results through use of a weighted combination of three performance metrics—revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FCF. 
We assessed and rewarded our most significant strategic accomplishments. Our decisions on ICP awards took into consideration a number of key accomplishments in 2018 across our three strategic areas of focus—growth and innovation, operational excellence, and high performing organization. 
We did not make across-the-board increases in base salaries for the 6th consecutive year. Notwithstanding strong results, consistent with our practices in recent years, our Compensation Committee did not increase NEO base salaries for market trends. The Compensation Committee adjusted Mr. Martell's salary in recognition of his strong leadership and management of the business through a challenging US mortgage market environment. Our Compensation Committee also adjusted the salary for Mr. Balas in recognition of his continued strong leadership in his CFO role. The new salaries for Mr. Martell and Mr. Balas move each of them to more competitive pay levels.

[END TABLE]
General Our Bylaws require that directors be elected annually, and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Board shall consist of such number of directors, as is determined from time to time, exclusively by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. Pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board, our Board consists of 11 directors, all of whom, other than Frank D. Martell, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is "independent" pursuant to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
The Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has nominated the 11 individuals set forth under "Nominees" below for election at the Annual Meeting, to serve until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Voting Standard Under our Bylaws, in an uncontested election, each director nominee will be elected to the Board to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, if the nominee receives a majority of votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee) with respect to such director nominee's election. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each director nominee who was in office prior to the election (each, an "incumbent director") is required to submit, and has submitted, to the Board an irrevocable letter of resignation from the Board and all committees thereof, which will become effective if the director does not receive a majority of votes cast and the Board determines to accept the resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. The Board will act on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee within 90 days from the date the election results are certified and thereafter promptly disclose its decision in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
The majority voting standard does not apply, however, in a contested election, where the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In a contested election, directors are instead elected by a plurality of shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors (meaning that the number of director nominees who receive the highest number of shares voted "for" their election are elected). The election of directors at the Annual Meeting will not be contested. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and, therefore, will not be counted in determining the outcome of the election of the director nominees. 
Nominees Set forth below is information concerning each person nominated and recommended to be elected as a director by our Board. The information set forth below is as of the date of this proxy statement. All of the nominees currently serve as our directors and were previously elected to the present term of office at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
All of the director nominees listed below have consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serve as directors if elected. If any nominee should become unable or unwilling for good cause to serve as a director, the proxies will be voted for such substitute nominee(s) as shall be designated by our Board or our Board may reduce the number of directors on our Board. Our Board currently has no knowledge that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve. 
See the section entitled "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters" for information pertaining to stock ownership of the nominees. There are no family relationships among any of the nominees or any of our executive officers. In addition, there were and are no arrangements or understandings between any director and any other person pursuant to which any director was or is to be selected as a director.

   OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS   
[END TABLE]
We are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, or NEOs. We urge stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section below, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and practices are designed and operate to achieve our pay for performance compensation philosophy, as well as the "Summary Compensation Table" and other related compensation tables and narratives. 
Our compensation program is heavily weighted toward performance-based compensation that provides a direct link between rigorous goals for corporate performance and pay outcomes for our executive officers. Our annual incentive plan also ties pay outcomes to the achievement of key strategic objectives that we believe will drive longer-term value to stockholders. We believe that our compensation program provides effective incentives for strong operating results by appropriately aligning pay and performance. 
In the advisory vote at our 2018 annual meeting, 98% of the votes cast by our stockholders supported our executive compensation policies and practices. While we have regularly received strong support for our executive pay practices, the Compensation Committee, with advice from independent third-party advisors, continues to engage in periodic reviews of our executive compensation and benefits programs and makes changes as appropriate to reflect our compensation philosophy and objectives, with consideration given to evolving trends and stockholder feedback. 
Accordingly, the Board requests your advisory vote to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion that accompanies the compensation tables), is hereby APPROVED." 
This proposal to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs is advisory only and will not be binding upon us or the Board, and will not be construed as overruling a decision by us or the Board or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty for us or our Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
Our policy is to provide stockholders with an annual opportunity to approve the compensation of the NEOs. The next advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs will occur at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Voting Standard Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (meaning that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, a majority of them must be voted "for" the proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" this proposal, and broker-non votes will not be counted in determining the outcome of this proposal.

The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance, and independence. The Audit Committee exercises sole authority to approve all audit engagement fees. In addition to ensuring the regular rotation of the lead audit engagement partner at least every five years as required by law, the Audit Committee is involved in the selection of, and reviews and evaluates, the lead audit engagement partner. 
The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PwC has audited the historical consolidated financial statements of our Company since June 2010, and of our predecessor, FAC, for all annual periods since 1954. To help ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they wish and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted for stockholder approval by our Bylaws, but the Audit Committee is seeking ratification of its selection of PwC from our stockholders as a matter of good corporate governance. If the stockholders do not ratify this selection, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, reconsider its selection of PwC and will either continue to retain PwC or appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our and our stockholders' best interests. 
Voting Standard Ratification of the selection of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (meaning that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, a majority of them must be voted "for" the proposal for it to be approved). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" this proposal. We do not expect any broker non-votes on this matter.  Report of the Audit Committee 
The following report of the Audit Committee is not soliciting material, is not deemed filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and is not incorporated by reference in any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), whether made before or after the date of this proxy statement and irrespective of any general incorporation language in such filing. 
The Audit Committee consists of five non-management directors: Messrs. Walker, Chatham, Dorman and Folino and Ms. Widener. All of the members meet the independence criteria and financial literacy requirements of the SEC and NYSE rules. The Audit Committee has certain duties and powers as described in its written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the charter can be found on the Investors section of our website under Leadership & Governance—Highlights at www.corelogic.com. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Company's accounting policies and financial reporting and disclosure practices, system of internal controls, internal audit process and the process for monitoring compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies on behalf of the Board. The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, for preparing the financial statements and for the public reporting process. The Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and discussed them with management, although the Audit Committee members are not the auditors or certifiers of the Company's financial statements. 
PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by applicable auditing standards, including Auditing Standard 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee, and has discussed with PwC its independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and be filed with the SEC.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor 
The Audit Committee retained PwC (along with other accounting firms) to provide non-audit services in 2018. We understand the need for PwC to maintain objectivity and independence as the auditor of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has established the following policies and processes related to audit and non-audit services. 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all engagements of our independent registered public accounting firm for audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee's pre-approval policy identifies specific services and assigns pre-approved spending thresholds for each group of non-audit services. This policy works in conjunction with our independent registered public accounting firm's annual audit services fee schedule, which is also approved by the Audit Committee. Any services not pre-approved or not covered by the policy or the audit services fee schedule are submitted to the Audit Committee's chairman, as the Audit Committee's designee, for review and approval and are subsequently ratified by the Audit Committee at its next meeting, as appropriate. 
All services provided by PwC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its designee. 
The Audit Committee has concluded that PwC's provision of audit and non-audit services to the Company is compatible with PwC's independence.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND

Pay Governance did not perform any services for the Company and the Compensation Committee does not believe that the services performed by Pay Governance raised any conflict of interest. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the services provided by its independent compensation consultant. 
Committee Independence. Our Board has determined that each member of our Compensation Committee is "independent" under applicable listing standards of the NYSE. In making its independence determination for each member of the Compensation Committee, our Board considered whether the director has a relationship with us that is material to the director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member. In addition, our Board has determined that each of Messrs. Chatham, Folino, O'Brien and Ms. Studenmund is a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and satisfies the requirements of an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.  Equity Awards Committee. The Equity Awards Committee was created by the Board in 2016 and has been delegated limited authority to approve and establish the terms of equity awards granted to eligible participants under our equity incentive plans. Mr. Martell is the sole committee member.

Board Diversity. We do not have a formal policy for the consideration of diversity in identifying nominees for director. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recognizes the benefits associated with a diverse board and, as indicated above, considers diversity as a factor when identifying and evaluating candidates for membership on our Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a broad conception of diversity, including professional and educational background, prior experience on other boards of directors (both public and private), political and social perspectives as well as race, gender and national origin. Utilizing these factors, and the factors described below under "Evaluation of Director Nominees", the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes recommendations, as it deems appropriate, regarding the composition and size of the Board. The priorities and emphasis of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and of the Board may change from time to time to take into account changes in business and other trends and the portfolio of skills and experience of current and prospective Board members. 
Stockholder Recommendations for Director Nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted procedures by which certain of our stockholders may recommend director nominees to the Board. In particular, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has established a policy whereby it will accept and consider, in its discretion, director recommendations from any stockholder holding in excess of 5% of our outstanding common stock. Such recommendations must include the name and credentials of the recommended nominee and should be submitted to our Secretary at our address included in this proxy statement. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate director candidates recommended by stockholders for election to our Board in the same manner and using the same criteria as used for any other director candidate (as described below). If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that a stockholder-recommended candidate is suitable for membership on our Board, it will include the candidate in the pool of candidates to be considered for nomination upon the occurrence of the next vacancy on our Board or in connection with the next annual meeting of stockholders.  Evaluation of Director Nominees. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has no specific minimum qualifications in evaluating a director candidate, it takes into account all factors it considers appropriate in identifying and evaluating candidates for membership on our Board, including some or all of the following: strength of character, an inquiring and independent mind, practical wisdom, mature judgment, career specialization, relevant industry experience, relevant technical skills, reputation in the community, diversity and the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes recommendations to the full Board as to whether or not incumbent directors should stand for re-election. However, if we are legally required by contract or otherwise to provide third parties with the ability to nominate directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may adjust its evaluation process for the designated candidates to reflect our contractual obligations with respect to their nomination. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts all necessary and appropriate inquiries into the background and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a search firm to assist in identifying potential candidates for nomination.

Independence of Directors 
Pursuant to the listing rules of the NYSE, a majority of the Board must be independent. A director will not qualify as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us). To assist in its determination of director independence, the Board has adopted categorical director independence standards, which are contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available to stockholders on the Investors section of our website under Leadership & Governance—Highlights at www.corelogic.com. 
In accordance with applicable NYSE listing rules and our categorical director independence standards, the Board has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Chatham, Curling, Dorman, Folino, O'Brien, Raina and Walker, and Mses. Munce, Studenmund and Widener is "independent". Mr. Martell is not considered independent because he is employed by us as a senior executive. 
During 2018, each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was determined by the Board to be independent in accordance with the applicable NYSE listing rules and in accordance with our categorical director independence standards. The Board further determined that each member of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee met the additional independence standards applicable to those committees under the NYSE listing rules and the SEC.  Board Leadership Structure 
The offices of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman are separate. Mr. Folino has served as Chairman of our Board since July 2014. Our Board believes that the separation of the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer continues to be appropriate as it allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus primarily on his management responsibilities and the Chairman to oversee and manage the Board and its functions. Having an independent Chairman promotes the independence of our Board and provides appropriate oversight of management and ensures free and open discussion and communication among the non-management members of our Board. The Chairman also chairs and coordinates the agenda for executive sessions of the non-management directors. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board shall annually elect a lead director by a majority vote of the independent directors unless the Chairperson of the Board is an independent director, in which case the Chairperson of the Board will perform the functions of a lead director and no lead director shall be elected. Mr. Folino, an independent director, is the Chairman and, as a result, we do not currently have a lead director. 
Director Education 
Directors are strongly encouraged to attend educational seminars regarding the Company's business, corporate governance and other issues pertaining to their directorship. We also provide the Board with educational training from time-to-time on subjects applicable to the Board and the Company, including with regard to industry and regulatory developments, accounting, financial reporting, and corporate governance, using both internal and external resources. 
Succession Planning 
Among the Compensation Committee's responsibilities described in its charter is to oversee development and succession planning for executive officers, and the Compensation Committee also oversees this for other key members of senior management. The Board plans for succession of the CEO and periodically reviews senior management selection and succession planning that is undertaken by the Compensation Committee. As part of this process, the non-management directors annually review the Compensation Committee's recommended candidates for senior management positions to see that qualified candidates are available for all positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of the candidates. The criteria used when assessing the qualifications of potential CEO successors include, among others, strategic vision and leadership, operational excellence, financial management, executive officer leadership development, ability to motivate employees, and an ability to develop an effective working relationship with the Board.  Risk Oversight 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Full Board To maximize  long-term stockholder value, the Board's responsibilities in overseeing our businesses include oversight of our key risks and management's processes and controls to regulate them appropriately. Our management, in turn, is responsible for  the day-to-day management of risk and implementation of appropriate risk management controls and procedures. Although risk oversight permeates many elements of the work  of the full Board, the Board has delegated to certain committees specific risk oversight matters.

Although risk oversight permeates many elements of the work  of the full Board, the Board has delegated to certain committees specific risk oversight matters. 
   Audit  Committee The Audit Committee has the most direct and systematic responsibility for overseeing risk management. The Audit Committee charter provides for a  variety of regular and recurring responsibilities relating to risk, including:     having responsibility for the internal audit function, with that function having a direct line of  communication to the  Audit Committee;     receiving reports from management and the internal audit function regarding the adequacy and effectiveness  of various internal controls;     reviewing periodically with internal counsel legal and regulatory matters that could have a significant  impact on us and could indicate emerging areas of risk;     overseeing accounting and risk management processes, including receiving regular reports from our Chief  Legal Officer; and     discussing with  management our guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and enterprise risk management, including our major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.   In performing these functions, the Audit Committee regularly receives reports from management  (including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Controller and the Chief Legal Officer) and internal auditors regarding our risk management program (which incorporates our compliance, information & cyber security,  and business continuity programs), extraordinary claims and losses, and significant litigation. The Board receives updates on risk oversight from the Audit Committee and members of management.        Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation  policies and practices and has assessed whether our compensation policies encourage excessive risk-taking. The Compensation Committee has concluded that these policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.  In arriving at that conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered, among other factors:     the metrics used to determine variable compensation;     the portion of variable compensation  paid in equity, which is either time-vested or tied to the achievement of long-term Company objectives;     the amount of compensation paid as sales commissions and the number of people to whom such compensation is  paid; and     controls, such as pricing  limits, a recoupment policy and financial reconciliation processes for sales crediting, quality checks that we employ and the approval process for certain compensation-related activities.

[END TABLE]
Our Board held six meetings during 2018 and our non-management directors also met five times in executive session without management present. Each director attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the Board and meetings of the committees (if any) on which the director served during his or her respective tenure on the Board during 2018. From time to time, our Board and committees also act by unanimous written consent as permitted by our Bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
Retention of Outside Advisors 
The Board and all of its committees have authority to retain outside advisors and consultants that they consider necessary or appropriate in carrying out their respective responsibilities. The independent accountants are retained by, and report directly to, the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for the selection, assessment, and termination of the internal auditors to which we have outsourced our internal audit function. Similarly, the consultant retained by the Compensation Committee to assist in the evaluation of senior executive compensation reports directly to that committee.  Code of Conduct 
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct (the "Code") that applies to all employees, including our directors, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and persons performing similar functions, which has been posted under "Investors—Leadership & Governance—Highlights" on our website www.corelogic.com. If we waive or amend any provisions of the Code that apply to our directors and executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and persons performing similar functions, we will disclose such waivers or amendments on our website, at the address and location specified above, to the extent required by applicable SEC and NYSE rules. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which have been posted under "Investors—Leadership & Governance—Highlights" on our website www.corelogic.com. In addition to stating the standards that the Board applies in determining whether or not its members are independent, these guidelines address, among other items, the qualifications and responsibilities of our directors and describe fundamental aspects of our Board and certain of its committees. 
Director Overboarding Policy 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our directors may not serve on more than five public company boards (including our Board), and our Audit Committee members may not serve on more than three public company audit committees (including our Audit Committee), in each case, without prior Board approval. In each case, in determining whether to grant such approval, the Board will consider the director's ability to devote sufficient time to the activities of the Board and/or Audit Committee and the director's qualifications and contribution, or potential contribution, to the Board and/or Audit Committee. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of our directors are in compliance with the overboarding policy. 
Board and Committee Evaluations 
To increase their effectiveness, the Board and each of its committees perform an annual self-evaluation under the direction of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The evaluation addresses, among other items, attendance, preparedness, participation, candor and other measures of performance selected by the Board. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
We encourage our directors to attend the annual meetings of our stockholders, either in person or telephonically. All eleven directors attended the 2018 annual meeting. 
Communicating with Directors 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with members of the Board, including the Chairman of the Board or any of the other non-management directors of our Company (individually or as a group), by writing to such director(s) at: 
CoreLogic, Inc. 
c/o Chief Legal Officer and Secretary 
40 Pacifica, Suite 900 
Irvine, CA 92618 
Our Corporate Secretary reviews and promptly forwards communications to the directors, as appropriate. Communications involving substantive accounting or auditing matters are forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee. Certain items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board will not be forwarded such as: business solicitation or advertisements; product- or service-related inquires; junk mail or mass mailings; resumes or other job-related inquires; and spam and inappropriately hostile, threatening, potentially   illegal or similarly unsuitable communications. Directors receiving communications will respond as such directors deem appropriate, including the possibility of referring the matter to management of our Company, to the full Board or to an appropriate committee of the Board. 
Transactions with Management and Others 
The Board has adopted a written policy regarding transactions with related persons that requires the approval or ratification by the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of any transaction exceeding $120,000 in which we are a participant and any related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A related person includes a director, nominee for election as a director, executive officer, person controlling over 5% of our common stock and the immediate family members of each of these individuals. Once a transaction has been determined to require approval, the transaction will be reviewed and approved by either the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and consider the terms, business purpose and benefits of the transaction to the Company and the related person. 
If a related party transaction is not pre-approved, then it must be brought to the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for ratification as promptly as possible. No member of the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may participate in the review or approval of a related party transaction in which he or she has a direct or indirect interest, unless the Chairman of the Board or the chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee requests such individual to participate. 
The following types of transactions do not require pre-approval: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensatory arrangements for service as an officer or director of ours, provided such compensation is approved by the  Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions between us and our affiliates (other than directors and officers);

Director Share Ownership Guidelines 
We require our non-management directors to own a fixed amount of Company stock. The guidelines are based on a multiple of the annual retainer and, beginning in 2018, require a value of at least $400,000 be held by each director. Directors have five years from their date of election to the Board to reach the ownership requirement. All Company securities owned outright or earned and subject only to time-based vesting restrictions, including deferred awards, are credited toward the requirement. 
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy 
The Company maintains a policy that prohibits director transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities on an exchange or in any other organized market, as well as holding Company securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

For purposes of this CD&A, the Committee refers to the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 
Our compensation program is designed to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders through execution in three areas of strategic focus: growth and innovation, operational excellence, and high performing organization. In 2018, a majority of our NEOs' compensation continued to be based upon our financial performance and execution against these strategic priorities. 
As we set our 2018 performance goals early in the year, we anticipated the potential for a high degree of volatility and unpredictability based on expectations for the economic environment such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An increasing interest rate environment due to a strong US economy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A decline in overall US mortgage origination unit volumes by approximately 10% compared to 2017 levels as the onset of  rising interest rates would unfavorably impact mortgage refinance activity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continuing impact on mortgage origination purchase volumes due to multiple factors such as tight inventory supply,  insufficient supply of new housing stock, and affordability, all of which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.  
[END TABLE]
We delivered strong operating and financial results in 2018 despite significant US mortgage market headwinds. In the face of these headwinds, we reduced our overall cost structure by more than $20 million through productivity initiatives and cost management, continued to invest in future growth and productivity initiatives, and completed targeted acquisitions to enhance our business mix by increasing our non-mortgage and international footprints while driving higher technology platform revenues. We invested in next generation technology capabilities focusing on data structures and visualization, technology platforms, and advanced automation techniques, which we expect will set a foundation for future growth and margin expansion. Finally, we enhanced our infrastructure capabilities as we initiated our migration to the Google Cloud platform. 
Notable financial accomplishments in 2018 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant market outperformance as our 2018 revenues were down 3%, as compared with a 15% estimated drop in overall US  mortgage market unit volumes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased adjusted EBITDA by 3% and adjusted EPS by 15%, supported by our productivity and cost initiatives.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generated $258 million of free cash flow while reinvesting to drive future growth and margin expansion.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delivered more than $20 million in cost management and productivity benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Repurchased approximately 3% of our outstanding common shares.  
[END TABLE]
We attribute these results to management's ability to navigate market volatility and maintain focus in a time of significant change, with strong leadership from Mr. Martell.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
Since 2011, we have grown revenues at an annual compounded rate of 7%, operating margin by 821 bps and adjusted EPS by 24%. 
We aligned annual incentives to rigorous financial targets. The Company's underlying pay-for-performance approach is intended to reward management appropriately in light of below- and above-expected performance results through use of a weighted combination of three performance metrics. For 2018, the Company exceeded its adjusted EBITDA target by 2.7%, but fell below target for revenue (-4.6%) and FCF (-2.4%). Combined results for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and FCF generated funding for corporate participants in our annual cash bonus plan, the ICP, of 96.7% of target. 
We assessed and rewarded our most significant strategic accomplishments. Our decisions on ICP awards took into consideration a number of key accomplishments in 2018 across our three strategic areas as noted below. Based on overall strong strategic accomplishments in the face of a challenging revenue environment, and individual contributions to those accomplishments, the Committee awarded our four NEOs from 110% to 131% of target. Total resulting payouts for our NEOs ranged from 95% to 100% of the overall ICP target for 2018.

Our Board and management are committed to maintaining sound and effective compensation and governance policies and programs designed to build value for our stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, 98% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve our executive compensation paid in 2017. With this support in favor of our existing compensation program, absence of negative feedback from our stockholder outreach effort, and following its regular review of our practices, the Committee determined to continue our 2017 compensation program in 2018 with only minor adjustments.  Active Engagement with Our Stockholders 
The Board and executive management are committed to engaging with our stockholders. Throughout the year, executive management proactively and consistently meets with current and prospective stockholders to discuss our strategic priorities, operational performance, and financial results. Also, through these discussions or separate outreach efforts, we seek to engage our top stockholders to solicit feedback on corporate governance, our compensation program, and related matters. In 2018, we conducted such outreach to our top stockholders representing a majority of our outstanding shares; these stockholders did not express concerns over our corporate governance practices or compensation program design. 
We did not make across-the-board increases in base salaries for the 6th consecutive year. Notwithstanding strong results, consistent with our practices in recent years, the Committee did not increase NEO base salaries for market trends. The Committee adjusted Mr. Martell's salary in recognition of his strong leadership and management of the business through a challenging US mortgage market environment. The Committee also adjusted the salary for Mr. Balas in recognition of his continued strong leadership in his CFO role. The new salaries for Mr. Martell and Mr. Balas move each of them to more competitive pay levels. 
GOOD PAY GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
The Committee oversees the design and administration of our compensation program and evaluates it against competitive practices, legal and regulatory developments and corporate governance trends. The Committee has incorporated the following governance features into our compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 PAY PHILOSOPHY 
We pay for performance. Our compensation program is heavily weighted toward performance-based compensation that provides a direct link between rigorous goals for corporate performance and pay outcomes for our executive officers. Our annual ICP also ties pay outcomes to the achievement of key strategic objectives that we believe will drive longer-term value to stockholders. We believe that our compensation program provides effective incentives for strong operating results by appropriately aligning pay and performance. Our philosophy is designed to:

Our compensation program emphasizes performance-based incentives. 86% of our CEO compensation and 75% of the compensation for the other NEOs is performance-based. The chart below illustrates our pay mix.  We increase base salaries based on performance or promotion. Our practice is to benchmark compensation annually but to increase an NEO's base salary only when warranted by sustained performance, an increase in the scope of responsibilities or significant gaps to competitive pay levels. Only Messrs. Martell and Balas received base salary increases in 2018 to recognize performance and move their respective salaries to more competitive levels. 
We set rigorous goals in our incentive plans. We set challenging goals for both our annual incentive and long-term equity plan. We outperformed US mortgage market trends and delivered single-digit top line growth in our core operations, resulting in the achievement of our adjusted EBITDA target and near-achievement of our revenue and FCF targets. 
We use strategic goals in our ICP. Results on strategic goals represent 25% of the annual ICP opportunity for our executive officers. We believe this approach rewards the accomplishment of key objectives that will drive future performance. The Committee separately determines the portion of the funded amount that should be paid as a result of achievement of the assigned objectives. The Committee carefully evaluates management's accomplishments relative to the goals, as further described below. 
We focus on long-term stockholder value. Nearly 70% of the total compensation opportunity for our CEO is based on achievement of stockholder-aligned performance and the value of our shares. For other NEOs, over half of their total target compensation opportunities are tied to these stockholder results. 
Our equity grants are tied to performance. In 2018, 50% of the target value of our long-term incentive awards for our CEO and other NEOs was granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") that vest based on achievement of adjusted EPS results relative to target and TSR relative to the companies in our Peer Group (as described and defined later in this section). The remaining 50% of the target value of our long-term incentive awards was granted in the form of RSUs that require us to achieve a threshold adjusted net income level in order to be eligible to vest. We set rigorous goals in our PBRSU awards, as reflected in the variability of payouts in the last three awards. The payouts above target reflect improved performance. In addition, to further incentivize the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin between 2018 and 2020, we granted certain key executives, including our NEOs but excluding our CEO, an additional performance-based long-term incentive award in 2018 (see the description of the A30 Award below).

 Determining Pay 
Generally, in determining base salary, target annual ICP and guidelines for long-term equity awards, the Committee considers several factors including, but not limited to, the executive officer's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• role, including the scope and complexity of responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience and capabilities, including institutional knowledge;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contributions or responsibilities beyond the typical scope of the role;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• individual performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• positioning relative to our other executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• difficulty in recruiting a replacement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• competitive compensation opportunities provided by our peers and other competitors for similar executive talent.   
[END TABLE]
Our philosophy is to incentivize and reward executive officers for future performance. While the Committee regularly reviews executive officer equity grants and vesting, it does not consider prior stock compensation gains (PBRSU payouts or restricted stock awarded in prior years) in setting future compensation levels. 
Peer Group and Benchmarking 
To monitor competitive compensation practices, the Committee relies primarily upon data compiled from public filings of selected companies (our "Peer Group") that it considers to be competitors or appropriate comparators for executive talent. The Committee reviews and approves the Peer Group annually. Criteria for Peer Group selection include firms that operate in data, information and analytics and related businesses. Our 2018 Peer Group is presented in the table below.

 The Committee reviews executive officer pay relative to the median pay of comparable positions in Peer Group companies and, as appropriate, relevant survey data from nationally-recognized consulting and data firms such as Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Equilar, scoped to a comparable revenue size for us, from both general industry and the high technology sector. 
2019 Peer Group Considerations 
Historically, the Company's peer group has been challenging to construct as there are few firms that operate with highly comparable business mixes. Peers have generally been information and service providers, with some financial technology firms also included. For 2019, the Company refreshed its peer group to provide greater alignment with businesses that are sensitive to mortgage origination volumes and interest rates. As was evident in 2018, despite our diversification efforts, there continues to be a strong relationship between the Company's stock performance and these volatile demand factors. 
The following organizations will be added to the 2019 compensation peer group: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Realogy Holdings Corporation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Cooper Group, Inc. (Formerly Nationstar Mortgage Holdings)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Radian Group, Inc.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PennyMac Financial Services, Inc.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Zillow Group, Inc.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• MGIC Investment Corporation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Altisource Portfolio Solutions  
[END TABLE]
Furthermore, four peers in the 2018 compensation peer group were acquired in 2018 and, therefore, will be removed: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• DST Systems  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dunn & Bradstreet  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Convergys Corporation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acxiom Corporation  
[END TABLE]
The new 2019 compensation peer group is intended to better reflect the Company's business portfolio and provide greater alignment with mortgage origination volumes and interest rate movements. 
Base Salary 
The Committee reviews base salaries annually and adjusts them, if appropriate, to recognize performance, promotions, expansion in scope of responsibilities, and gaps relative to base salaries of similar individuals in the Peer Group and survey data described above. To increase the weighting of variable, performance-based pay in the compensation mix, in recent years the Committee has not increased salaries for executive officers, except where there has been a promotion, expansion of role and responsibilities, or to recognize performance. 
In 2018, the Committee increased the base salaries for Mr. Martell and Mr. Balas, as both made major contributions to the successful execution of the Company's strategic plan in 2018. In addition, there were significant gaps between their salaries and the competitive market rate. No other NEO received a base salary increase in 2018.  Annualized base salaries of the executive officers for 2017 and 2018 are set forth in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    2017      2018   
 Frank D. Martell    $ 725,000      $ 780,000   
 James L. Balas    $ 425,000      $ 450,000   
 Barry M. Sando    $ 550,000      $ 550,000   
 Arnold A. Pinkston (1)      —      $ 425,000   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Pinkston was hired in January 2018 as the Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
Annual Incentives (ICP) 
The ICP rewards executive officers for financial and operating performance relative to rigorous, predetermined financial goals and strategic objectives. As part of our business planning process, management prioritizes a range of value drivers based on anticipated market demand including estimated mortgage origination volumes, prior year performance, business strategy and risk factors. The Committee then evaluates management's recommendations in light of stockholder expectations and establishes final ICP financial and strategic goals, including performance and payout ranges. 
2018 Target Incentives. The Committee established the following 2018 target bonus opportunities for our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Title    Base Salary      ($000s)% of Salary    Target ($000s)    Maximum ($000s)      
 Frank D. Martell    President and CEO      $ 780         140%      $ 1,092       $ 2,184      
 James L. Balas    Chief Financial Officer      $ 450         100%      $ 450       $ 900      
 Barry M. Sando    Managing Director, Underwriting and Workflow Solutions      $ 550         100%      $ 550       $ 1,100      
 Arnold A. Pinkston    Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary      $ 425         80%      $ 340       $ 680      
[END TABLE]
ICP Performance Metrics. For 2018, the Committee selected the following three performance measures for the ICP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue (GAAP metric)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDA — a non-GAAP metric calculated as net income from  continuing operations adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, non-operating gains/losses and other adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Free Cash Flow — a non-GAAP metric calculated as net cash provided by  continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee selected these measures in order to reflect a balanced perspective on performance including growth, profitability and cash management. The Committee believes these measures drive the valuation of our stock. Please see Appendix A for a detailed reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  For 2018, 75% of the ICP opportunity was based on our financial performance goals and 25% on established strategic objectives for each executive officer. Results for achievement of revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FCF goals were weighted as follows in determining ICP funding: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Revenue      34%   
 Adjusted EBITDA      33%   
 Free Cash Flow      33%   
[END TABLE]
Threshold Performance Requirement. For 2018, no award was payable unless our 2018 adjusted net income exceeded $62.5 million. 
Funding Formula for Financial Results. At least 80% of targeted performance (threshold) for a metric must be achieved to generate any funding for that metric. The funding formula is set out in the table below. For performance levels between threshold and target or between target and maximum, the funding is determined by linear interpolation. Notwithstanding the actual ICP funding results, the Committee retains the discretion to decrease the actual payment for an ICP participant. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Level    Less than Threshold      Threshold      Target      Maximum and Above   
 Performance as% of Target      < 80%        80%        100%        120%   
 Payout as a% of Target      0%        34%        100%        200%   
[END TABLE]
The sum of the weighted results of the three financial metrics funds the ICP awards. For 2018, NEOs received 75% of the funded amount based on financial results. Awards for the remaining 25% of the funded amount were based on an evaluation of performance on strategic goals. For outstanding performance on strategic objectives, the ICP structure permits the strategic goal payment percentage of up to 200% of target. 
Financial results were measured at the corporate level for NEOs except for Mr. Sando, whose financial results were weighted 33.3% on the corporate metrics previously outlined and 66.7% on segment-level revenue and adjusted EBITDA results for the segment he manages. Funding for his strategic objectives component was determined by corporate results alone in alignment with the other NEOs. 
Determining Awards for Strategic Goal Achievement. The Committee determined that three major areas of our business strategy should be used for ICP strategic goals: (1) growth and innovation, (2) operational excellence, and (3) high performing organization. The Committee believed that these were the critical strategic focal areas for accelerating achievement of our long-strategy which are not otherwise measurable through annual financial performance metrics. 
The CEO provides the Committee with his assessment of individual results on strategic goals for the other executive officers and the Committee assesses the achievement level of the CEO. Based on these assessments, the Committee determines strategic goal achievement awards for each of the NEOs. 
2018 Financial Results and Funding. As set out in the table below, 2018 corporate financial performance resulted in 96.7% of target funding. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Performance Metric    Weight    Target ($000)    Actual 2018 Results ($000)    Percentage Achieved    Funding Percentage 
 2018 Revenue        34%        $ 1,875        $ 1,788          95.4%          84.7%   
 2018 Adjusted EBITDA        33%        $ 480        $ 493          102.7%          113.5%   
 2018 Free Cash Flow        33%        $ 264        $ 258          97.6%          92.1%

[END TABLE]
 Strategic Goal Results and Awards. For Messrs. Martell, Balas, Sando and Pinkston, the Committee determined that each of these executive officers demonstrated performance above a targeted expectation on the achievement of strategic objectives. An overarching factor was management's success in achieving strong financial results against the backdrop of a more difficult economic environment than had been anticipated. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name   ($000)% of Target   75% Weight% of Target   25% Weight% of Target    Award ($000)

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Financial goals for Mr. Sando are calculated based on a split between corporate targets (25%) and segment revenue and  adjusted EBITDA targets (50%), together accounting for 75% of his total ICP award. Unadjusted funding results for the segment were 92.8% of target resulting in blended achievement level of 86.5%.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives (LTI) 
Our LTI program is designed to motivate and reward profitable growth and stockholder value creation through awards of performance-based and time-vested equity. The Committee believes that using performance-based and time-vesting equity vehicles reinforces both performance and retention of key executives while aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and encouraging an appropriate level of risk-taking. 
Long-term incentives represent the largest component of executive officer compensation. In 2018, we granted 50% of total LTI value in PBRSUs, and 50% in RSUs. As outlined in more detail below, we also granted a special performance-based incentive of one-times base salary for Messrs. Balas, Sando, and Pinkston, the A30 Awards, focused on achievement of aggressive EBITDA margin expansion from 2018 to 2020. 
In determining the amount of the equity compensation awarded to each executive officer, the Committee primarily considered company and individual performance. However, the Committee may also evaluate any factor it considers relevant including competencies, skills, prior experiences, scope of responsibility and accountability within the organization, and the LTI awards made by Peer Group companies to similarly-situated executive officers. 
LTI Targets. The Committee established the following 2018 LTI targets for our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Title    ($000s)% of Salary     ($000s)  
 Frank D. Martell    President and CEO      $ 780         475%      $ 3,705

PBRSUs Granted in 2018. The 2018 PBRSUs are earned based on adjusted EPS achieved relative to annual targets for each of the three years of the performance period 2018 through 2020. 
Shares earned are calculated as described below. Participants earn the greater number of PBRSUs resulting from Step 1 or Step 2 (described in Step 3). 
Step 1: Calculate PBRSUs Earned Annually 
As illustrated in the graphic below, adjusted EPS and relative TSR results determine the portion of the PBRSUs that are earned each year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(A)  For the PBRSUs granted in 2018, 30% of the PBRSUs may be earned based on 2018 performance, 50% based on 2019 performance,  and 20% based on 2020 performance.

Step 2: Calculate PBRSUs Earned at End of 3-Year Performance Period 
Calculations of PBRSUs earned at the end of the 3-year performance period use the same schedules as for annual calculations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EPS earnout schedule (calculation B above) measured using cumulative adjusted EPS over 3 years relative to  the 3-year EPS target  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TSR Modifier schedule (calculation C above) measured over 3 years  
[END TABLE]
Step 3: PBRSUs earned equals the greater of cumulative PBRSUs earned in the 3 annual calculations during the grant cycle (from Step 1) or the 3-year calculation (from Step 2) 
2018 Performance for 2018 PBRSU Grant. We achieved strong financial and operating results in 2018 despite the macro-economic headwinds, as evidenced by adjusted EPS outcomes at above-target performance levels. As adjusted EPS performance did not trigger a payout above 150%, there was no modification from the TSR Modifier.

PBRSUs Settled After 2018. PBRSUs granted in 2016 were paid out after the end of the 2016-2018 performance period. The calculation of the payout is presented in the table below. Three-year adjusted EPS resulted in above-target performance on both the annual and 3-year calculation basis. As performance did not trigger a payout above 150% of target, there was no modification from the TSR Modifier and the payout was set at the 3-year cumulative result of 141.07%.

Timing of Equity Awards. After Committee approval, we generally issue annual equity awards to executive officers on the second day on which the NYSE is open for trading following the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, using the last sale price reported for a share of our common stock on the NYSE on that date. Grants to new hires or other grants outside the annual grant cycle follow the same methodology, except that awards are generally issued on the 20th day (or the next succeeding business day if the market is closed on the 20th day) of the third month of the calendar quarter that follows the date on which the Committee approved the awards.  Special One-Time A30 Award. In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a special one-time award (the "A30 Award") to provide a focused incentive for achievement of an aggressive adjusted EBITDA margin expansion between 2018 and 2020. The award is also intended to enhance executive retention and promote the achievement of major strategic initiatives (e.g., workflow automation and adoption of related technologies). The special one-time award was granted to senior leaders (including our NEOs but excluding the CEO) and leaders of our centers of excellence. For each of the NEO recipients, the target award value was equal to 1.0x the executive's 2018 salary. The awards are presented in the table below for the NEO recipients. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name        2018 A30 Special Award         Target  Value

[END TABLE]
A30 Award Performance Metric and Targets. The A30 Award consists of units that are settled and vest at the end of 2020. Each unit converts to one share. The units have a target grant value equal to 100% of base salary and are earned based on achievement of pre-determined 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin targets. 
Retirement and Employee Benefit Plans 
Executive officers are entitled to the same benefits generally available to all full-time employees (subject to fulfilling any minimum service requirement) including the 401(k) plan, healthcare, life insurance and other welfare benefit programs. In designing these benefits, we seek to provide an overall level of benefits that is competitive with those offered by similar companies in the markets in which we operate. We believe that these employee benefits provide a valuable recruiting and retention mechanism for our executive officers and enable us to compete more successfully for qualified executive talent. 
Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan and the Pension Restoration Plan. Mr. Sando became a participant in our Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan (the "Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan") prior to its closure to new participants in 2010. On November 18, 2010, we amended the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan to freeze benefits effective as of December 31, 2010. As a result, compensation earned after 2010 is not considered in determining covered compensation and final average compensation; service after 2010 is not recognized, except for vesting purposes. Mr. Sando is also a participant in the Pension Restoration Plan, which is limited to individuals who became participants before 1995. Explanation of these plans can be found in the Pension Benefits table below. 
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified retirement plan that allows eligible participants to defer up to 80% of their salary and annual incentive bonus. Participation is limited to executive officers and certain other key employees. In 2010, we amended the Deferred Compensation Plan to provide additional Company contributions in the form of 401(k) restoration.  Other Benefits. We also maintain an executive life insurance program for executive officers and other key employees. This program provides the participant with up to two times their annualized base salary (up to a maximum of $1 million) in group universal life insurance. 
Further details regarding perquisites are found in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and accompanying footnotes. 
Role of the Committee and the Chief Executive Officer 
The Committee is composed solely of independent members of our Board. The Committee reviews and approves executive officer base salaries, annual incentive bonus programs, long-term incentive compensation and other incentive and executive benefit plans. The Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, analyzes the reasonableness of executive officer compensation, in part by reviewing compensation data from comparable companies and from relevant other industry sources. 
Decisions regarding compensation of the CEO are made solely by the Committee based on its deliberations with input from its independent compensation consultant. Decisions regarding other executive officers are made by the Committee after considering recommendations from the CEO as appropriate, as well as input from the Committee's independent compensation consultant. Our CEO and, as appropriate, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, may attend the portion of the Committee's meetings where individual executive officer performance is discussed. Only Committee members may vote on executive officer compensation decisions. 
The Committee regularly meets in executive session with its independent compensation consultant. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Committee retained Pay Governance LLC as its independent compensation consultant to advise on executive officer compensation for 2018. The consultant generally advises the Committee on all aspects of the executive compensation program design and governance process. During 2018, as part of its engagement with the Committee, the independent compensation consultant: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• advised on the selection of a peer group of companies for executive officer compensation comparison purposes;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provided guidance on industry best practices, emerging trends and developments in executive officer compensation, and  investor views of compensation design and practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consulted on incentive design;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• advised on determining the total compensation of each of our executive officers and the material elements of total  compensation, including (1) annual base salaries, (2) target cash bonus amounts, and (3) the structure and target amount of long-term incentive awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consulted on non-employee director compensation; and,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assisted on a compensation risk assessment.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee retained its independent compensation consultant directly, although in carrying out assignments, the consultant also interacted with Company management on behalf of the Committee. Pay Governance performed no services for the Company, and the Committee does not believe the independent compensation consultant's work has raised any conflict of interest. The Committee has the sole authority to select, retain, and terminate the independent compensation consultants. 
Adjustment or Recovery of Awards (Claw-backs)
The Company maintains a recoupment policy that enables recovery of performance-based compensation to the extent that it is later determined that applicable performance goals were not actually achieved taking into account a financial restatement or ethical misconduct. We also added claw-backs in termination agreements for all executive officers. This policy applies to all performance-based incentive plans including but not limited to the annual incentive cash bonus and performance-based equity awards described above.  Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy 
The Company maintains a policy that prohibits executive officer transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market as well as holding Company securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements 
We require our executive officers to own a fixed amount of our stock. The rigorous guidelines are based on a multiple of base salary as outlined below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position    Ownership Guidelines 
 Chief Executive Officer    6x base salary 
 Chief Financial Officer    3x base salary 
 Managing Directors    3x base salary 
 Other Executive Officers    1x base salary 
[END TABLE]
Covered officers have five years from their date of hire or promotion to the covered position to reach the ownership requirement. All Company securities owned outright or earned and subject only to time-based vesting restrictions count toward the requirement; stock options do not count toward the ownership requirement. Furthermore, we have adopted a share retention requirement which provides that all covered executives must hold at least 50% of net (after tax) shares until the stock ownership guidelines described above are achieved. All NEOs have met their ownership requirements. 
Actual Share Ownership vs. Minimum Share Ownership Requirement 
(As multiple of base salary) 
President and CEO 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x 6x 7x 8x 9x 10x >10x F. Martell CFO J. Balas Managing Director, UWS B. Sando Other Named Executive Officers A. Pinkston Holdings as of December 31, 2018 as a multiple of base salary using stock price of $33.42 Minimum ownership requirement Current actual holdings as of December 31, 2018 
Employment Agreements and Severance Arrangements 
Each currently employed executive officer is party to an employment agreement with us. The Committee believes that offering employment agreements to key executive officers is consistent with peer practices and serves as an effective retention tool. Each agreement is individually negotiated and terms may vary. For additional information regarding the terms of the employment agreements, including severance arrangements that we have entered into with our executive officers see "Employment Agreements" below. 
Change in Control Agreements 
Equity awards are currently issued under the 2018 Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting held in May 2018. Prior to the approval of the 2018 Plan, we issued share-based awards under the 2011 Plan, as amended. The 2011 Plan and 2018 Plan do not include an automatic "single trigger" change in control vesting provision. Instead, both plans include a change in control provision where automatic   accelerated vesting of an award in connection with a change in control will only occur if an acquirer or successor to us fails to assume or continue the awards or the awards otherwise do not survive the transaction. Additionally, award agreements include "double-trigger" severance protections and provide for accelerated vesting of awards that remain outstanding following a change in control transaction in the event of a termination without cause following a change in control. 
The Deferred Compensation Plan generally provides for accelerated vesting of awards or benefits, as the case may be, in the event of a change in control of the Company. In addition, the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan provides that when a participant incurs an involuntary separation from service without good cause subsequent to a change in control, payment of benefits will commence in the same manner and in the same amount as if the participant had attained his or her normal retirement age on the date of termination. 
In addition to the plan and award agreement provisions described above, we have entered into a change in control agreement (a "Change in Control Agreement") with each of our NEOs. Under the Change in Control Agreement, a "change in control" means the consummation of any one of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a merger or consolidation of the Company in which our stockholders end up owning less than 50% of the voting securities of  the surviving entity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or the complete liquidation or  dissolution of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a change in the composition of our Board of Directors over a two-year period as a  result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are incumbent directors, as defined in the agreement; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group, subject to certain limited exceptions, of at least 30% of our  voting securities.  
[END TABLE]
If the termination of our executive officer's employment occurs without cause or if the executive officer terminates his employment for good reason within the twenty-four-month period following a change in control, we will pay the following benefits in one lump sum in the month following the month in which the date of the termination occurs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive officer's base salary through and including the date of termination and any accrued but unpaid annual  incentive bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• between two and three times the executive officer's target annual cash bonus amount established for the fiscal year in  which the termination occurs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• between two and three times the executive officer's annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of  termination.  
[END TABLE]
Furthermore, under the Change in Control Agreement, for a period ranging from twenty-four to thirty-six months and subject to the covered executive officer's continued payment of the same percentage of the applicable premiums as the executive officer was paying immediately prior to the date of termination or, if more favorable to the executive officer, at the time at which the change in control occurred, we will provide medical and dental coverage pursuant to COBRA for the executive officer (and if applicable, the executive officer's dependents). To the extent that the executive officer cannot participate in the plans previously available, we will provide such benefits on the same after-tax basis as if they had been available. These obligations are reduced by any welfare benefits made available to the executive officer from subsequent employers. 
The Change in Control Agreement provides that if any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax), applies to the payments, benefits or other amounts payable under the agreement or otherwise, including without limitation, any acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stock options, restricted stock or performance shares (collectively, the "Total Payments"), then the Total Payments will be reduced (but not below zero) so that the maximum amount of the Total Payments (after reduction) will be $1.00 less than the amount which would cause the Total Payments to be subject to the excise tax; provided that such reduction to the Total Payments will be made only if the after-tax benefit to the executive officer is greater after giving effect to such reduction than if no such reduction had been made. This type of provision is often referred to as a "modified cut-back," and is included because the Change in Control Agreement does not provide for any type of "gross up" or similar benefit.  The Change in Control Agreement had an initial term through December 31, 2011 and is automatically extended for additional one-year periods unless either party notifies the other not later than the preceding January 1 that it does not wish to extend the term for an additional year. All agreements with current executive officers have since been extended through December 31, 2019. For a description of the calculations and further explanation of the payments due to the executive officers upon termination of employment and/or a change in control, see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control tables below. 
Impact of Tax and Accounting 
As a general matter, the Committee considers the various tax and accounting implications of the compensation vehicles we employ. When determining amounts of long-term incentive grants to executive officers and employees, the Committee examines the accounting cost associated with the grants. Under accounting guidance, grants of stock options, RSUs and PBRSUs result in an accounting charge for the Company. The accounting charge is equal to the fair value of the instruments being issued. For RSUs, the cost is generally equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant times the number of shares granted. This expense is amortized over the requisite service period. With respect to stock options, we calculate the fair value of the option and take that value into account as an expense over the vesting period, after adjusting for forfeitures. For PBRSUs, we calculate the fair value of the award upon grant and adjust the value to be expensed on a quarterly basis over the performance period based on expected award payouts, after adjusting for forfeitures. 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally prohibits a publicly-held company from deducting compensation paid to a current or former NEO that exceeds $1.0 million during the tax year. Certain awards granted before November 2, 2017 that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures that were set by the Committee under a plan approved by the Company's stockholders, as well as amounts payable to former executive officers pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1.0 million deductibility limit. 
As one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the Committee noted this deductibility limitation. However, the Committee has the flexibility to take any compensation-related actions that it determines are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, including awarding compensation that may not be deductible for tax purposes. There can be no assurance that any compensation will in fact be deductible.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing CD&A with management. Based on its review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and in the Company's proxy statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders.

(4)  For 2018, reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards, consisting of RSUs and PBRSUs, computed in  accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. We valued the RSUs as of the grant date by multiplying the closing  price of our common stock on that date by the number of RSUs awarded. We valued the PBRSUs as of the grant date by multiplying the closing price of our common stock on that date by the target number of PBRSUs that will vest upon achievement of the  target performance. The RSUs were granted and vest contingent upon the satisfaction of certain performance criteria through December 31, 2018, which criteria were satisfied, and thereafter vest based on continued employment through  December 31, 2020. The PBRSUs were granted and vest contingent upon satisfaction of certain performance criteria and continued employment through December 31, 2020. If the highest performance target is met or exceeded, the value of the  awards at grant date would be as follows: Mr. Martell $3,704,964; Mr. Balas $1,799,880; Mr. Sando $2,199,861; and Mr. Pinkston $1,699,856.

Employment Agreements 
Effective March 6, 2017, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Martell, which superseded the prior agreement and amendments thereto. On April 8, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Balas. In May 2011, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Sando, as amended June 16, 2014 and October 6, 2014. Effective January 2, 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Pinkston. The material terms of the employment agreements, which are substantially similar in form, are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Term: One-year term through December 31 of each calendar year, with  automatic renewal for an additional year unless either party provides 60 days prior written notice before the expiration of the current term. Neither party to the NEO employment agreements provided such notice in 2018, and accordingly the term  of each automatically extended through December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay: Sets initial base salary at current salary at the time the agreement was entered into or amended and provides  that base salary will be reviewed annually and may be increased (but not decreased) during the term at our discretion.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance: Provides for severance pay if the NEO is terminated without "cause" as defined in the  employment agreement. The severance amount is a multiple of base pay and target annual bonus. For Messrs. Martell and Sando, the multiple is two and COBRA reimbursement is provided for 24 months. For Messrs. Balas and Pinkston, the  multiple is one and COBRA reimbursement is provided for 12 months. The NEOs are also entitled to receive payment of a pro-rata portion of any annual bonus actually earned based on performance that they  would have otherwise received had their employment not terminated.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance Payment Timing: Severance will be paid in installments as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Martell and Sando — First payment is made in the seventh month after separation of employment and is  7/24th of the total severance and equal installments thereafter for the remainder;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Balas and Pinkston — First payment is made in the seventh month after separation of employment and is  7/12th of the total severance and equal installments thereafter for the remainder.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Release of Liability: The employment agreement requires the NEO to sign a release in exchange for severance.  Moreover, the NEOs are covered by restrictive covenants such as indefinite confidentiality, cooperation in litigation and non-competition.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Claw-backs: The employment agreement provides that the agreement is  subject to "claw-back" under applicable law or under our claw-back policy in effect from time to time. We adopted such a recoupment or "claw-back" policy in March 2012 as further described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Adjustment or Recovery of Awards  (Claw-backs)".

Pension Benefits for 2018 
The following table shows the actuarial present value of the accumulated retirement benefits payable upon normal retirement age to each of the NEOs who participate in a pension plan, computed as of December 31, 2018. The amounts disclosed are based upon benefits provided to the NEOs under our Pension Restoration Plan and our Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan. Benefit accruals were frozen under the Pension Restoration Plan as of April 30, 2008 and the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2010. We previously maintained a pension plan, which was assumed by First American Financial Corporation ("FAFC") in connection with spinning off our financial services businesses now known as FAFC on June 1, 2010 (the "Separation"). Messrs. Balas, Martell and Pinkston were not eligible to participate in the Pension Restoration Plan or the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan and therefore they are not included in the following table. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Name    Plan Name     Number of Years Credited Service (1)(#)       Present Value of Accumulated Benefits (2)($)       Payments During Last Fiscal Year   
(1)  Credited years of service for the Pension Restoration Plan and the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan is the time between  the participant's deemed participation date under the plan and December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The Pension Restoration Plan benefits generally accrue from the date of employment through the normal retirement age (as  discussed below). The following assumptions were used for calculating present values: interest rate of 4.23%, post-retirement mortality per RP-2014 Table for Healthy  Annuitants with mortality projection starting in 2006 using Fully Generational Scale MP-2018, and benefit is payable as a single life annuity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan eligibility requires 10 years of service and 5 years of participation in the  plan with the benefit dependent on age at retirement between 55 and 62, rather than credited years of service. The following assumptions were used for calculating present value: interest rate of 4.15%  post-retirement mortality at December 31, 2018; RP-2006 "Healthy Annuitants" table with generational projection based on  MP-2018 Order 2 Graduation Alternative Projection Scale. Benefit is payable as a 50% joint and survivor annuity.  
[END TABLE]
Pension Restoration Plan 
During 1996, we adopted the Pension Restoration Plan. This plan is an unfunded, non-qualified plan designed to make up for the benefit accruals that were limited under our tax-qualified pension plan based on compensation in excess of the amount of compensation that may be considered under federal tax law limits for qualified plans. However, in order to limit its expense, the Pension Restoration Plan does not make up for benefit accruals on compensation exceeding $275,000. The Pension Restoration Plan also makes up for benefits that could not be paid from a qualified plan because of limitations imposed by the federal tax laws. Vesting of benefits payable to an employee under the Pension Restoration Plan generally occurs upon employment through "normal retirement age." "Normal retirement age" is defined as the later of the employee's attainment of age 65 or three years of service with us. The Pension Restoration Plan was effective as of January 1, 1994, but only covers selected employees who were participants in the tax-qualified pension plan formerly sponsored by us which was assumed by FAFC in connection with the Separation. The Pension Restoration Plan excludes pay earned after December 31, 2001. The Pension Restoration Plan was amended in February 2008 to eliminate benefit accruals for service after April 30, 2008. 
Effective January 1, 2009, to comply with Section 409A of the Code, payment of benefits under the Pension Restoration Plan commences the first of the month following a participant's separation from service or six months following a participant's separation from service if he is considered a specified employee. Also, benefit options under the Pension Restoration Plan include various actuarial equivalent annuity options. A participant with at least three years of service with us may elect to retire after attaining age 55, but prior to age 65, and receive reduced benefits. Benefits are reduced 1/180th for each of the first 60 months and by 1/360th for each of any additional months by which the benefit commencement date precedes the participant's normal retirement date. Mr. Sando is the only NEO who participates in the Pension Restoration Plan, and he was eligible for early retirement but not normal retirement at December 31, 2018. 
On June 1, 2010, in connection with spinning off the businesses now known as FAFC, the sponsorship of a portion of the Pension Restoration Plan and the liabilities under the plan were transferred to FAFC with respect to the accrued benefits for employees and former employees who were transferred to FAFC. We remain responsible for liabilities under the Pension Restoration Plan relating to the accrued benefits of employees who were not transferred to FAFC, which are now payable pursuant to the terms of the CoreLogic, Inc. Pension Restoration Plan, the successor plan to the original Pension Restoration Plan. The new plan is intended to govern the benefits payable to participants under the plan as of June 1, 2010 and is not intended to grant additional benefits to the participants in excess of their benefits accrued under the original Pension Restoration Plan. 
Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan 
The Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan provides retirement benefits for, and pre-retirement death benefits with respect to, certain key management personnel. The plan was originally adopted in 1985 and has been amended a number of times since then. Under the plan, as originally adopted, upon retirement at normal retirement date (the later of age 65 or completion of 10 years of service) the participant received a joint life and 50% survivor annuity benefit equal to 35% of "final average compensation." "Final average compensation" was determined for those three calendar years out of the last 10 years of employment preceding retirement in which final average compensation is the highest. Final average compensation includes base salary and commissions, cash bonuses and stock bonuses that are granted to compensate for past services (such as annual incentive bonus RSUs).  Under the original plan, the benefit was reduced by 5% for each year prior to normal retirement date in which retirement occurs and, until age 70, increased by 5% (compounded in order to approximate the annuitized value of the benefit had retirement occurred at age 65) for each year after such date in which retirement occurs. With respect to such postponed retirement, the plan took into account covered compensation received until age 70, so that the retirement benefit of an executive who retires after normal retirement date is determined as the greater of the annuitized benefit or the benefit calculated using final average compensation until age 70. 
To be eligible to receive benefits under the plan, a participant must be at least age 55, have been an employee of us or one of our subsidiaries for at least 10 years and covered by the plan for at least five years. A pre-retirement death benefit is provided consisting of 10 annual payments, each of which equals 50% of final average compensation. Subject to applicable legal rules, the Board can, in its discretion, pay the participant or beneficiary in an actuarial equivalent lump sum or other form of benefit. In the event of a "change in control" (as defined in the plan) of us, a participant who retires after the change in control shall receive the same benefits as if he were retiring upon the attainment of normal retirement date. 
The Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan was amended in September 2005 to provide that participants who thereafter engage in competition with us, either during their employment with or following their departure, forfeit their right to receive any vested benefits under the plan. Competition includes the misappropriation, sale, use or disclosure of our trade secrets, confidential or proprietary information and solicitation of our customers. 
To reduce the costs of the plan to us, the plan was further amended in October 2007. Among other changes, this amendment (i) reduced the normal retirement date to the latest of age 62, the date on which the participant completes 10 years of service with us and the date on which the participant was covered, in combination, by the plan or FAC Management Supplemental Benefit Plan for five years; (ii) changed the period over which "final average compensation" is determined to the five calendar years preceding retirement; (iii) reduced the maximum benefit payable to a joint life and 50% survivor annuity benefit equal to 30% of final average compensation; (iv) eliminated any increased benefit for postponed retirement beyond the normal retirement date; and (v) provided for accelerated vesting only upon a change in control that is not approved by our incumbent Board. The benefit is reduced by 5.952% for each year prior to age 62 in which retirement actually occurs. Participants who were vested as of the effective date of the amendment, November 1, 2007, are entitled to receive the higher of the benefit as calculated under the amended plan and the benefit to which the participant would have been entitled had he retired on October 31, 2007. 
In connection with the Separation, we transferred sponsorship and administration of a portion of the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan to FAFC. As part of this transfer, FAFC assumed the liabilities under the portion of the plan covering employees and former employees who were transferred to FAFC. Following the Separation, we remained responsible for the liabilities under the portion of the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan relating to our employees and former employees who were not transferred to FAFC. We maintain the CoreLogic, Inc. Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan as the successor to the original Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan in satisfaction of its liabilities to such employees who were participants and accrued benefits under the Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan, but were not transferred to FAFC. The CoreLogic, Inc. Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan is intended to provide future benefits for our employees on and after June 1, 2010 and is intended to govern the benefits payable to such employees both before and after June 1, 2010. 
Effective December 31, 2010, the CoreLogic, Inc. Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan was frozen and amended to, among other things: (i) close the plan to new participants; (ii) freeze the average pay calculation as of December 31, 2010 (compensation after December 31, 2010 will not be taken into consideration in calculating benefits); (iii) amend the amount and form of the pre-retirement death benefit to provide for payment to a participant's designated beneficiary in an amount equal to the survivor portion of a 50% joint and survivor annuity for the life of the beneficiary, or if the participant's beneficiary is someone other than the participant's spouse or domestic partner, for a maximum of twenty years; and (iv) apply a proration factor to the benefit amount payable, the numerator of which is a participant's service at December 31, 2010 and the denominator of which is the participant's service that would have accrued as of his or her early retirement date if the participant was not early retirement eligible as of December 31, 2010.  In addition to the amendments described above, the change of control provisions were amended to provide that participants will become 100% vested in all plan benefits upon an involuntary separation from service without good cause following a change of control. Prior to the amendment, participants became 100% vested in all plan benefits upon a change of control, regardless of whether they incurred a separation of service for any reason. Furthermore, the retirement income benefit provided to participants and commencing upon a separation from service following a change of control on the same basis as though they had attained normal retirement age is limited to participants who experience an involuntary separation from service without good cause following a change of control. 
As of December 31, 2018, there remained three active employees, including Mr. Sando, who participate in the plan. The plan is closed to new participants. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Sando was eligible for early retirement but not normal retirement. The plan is unfunded and unsecured. We have previously purchased insurance, of which we are the owner and beneficiary, on the lives of certain plan participants. This insurance is designed to offset, over the life of the plan, a portion of our costs incurred with respect to the plan.

(2)  Represents earnings or losses on participant-selected investment options. None of  the amounts are reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table because the return on deferred amounts is calculated in a similar manner and at a similar rate as earnings on externally managed mutual funds.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  To the extent the executive officers were NEOs in prior years, the amounts reported in the aggregate balance at last  fiscal year end that represented prior salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation deferrals or Company contributions were previously reported as compensation to the NEO in our Summary Compensation Table  as "Salary," "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" or "All Other Compensation" in previous years. Amounts reported in the aggregate balance at last fiscal year end that  represent earnings in prior years on previously deferred amounts are not reflected on prior period Summary Compensation Tables.  
[END TABLE]
The Deferred Compensation Plan offers to a select group of management and highly compensated employees the opportunity to elect to defer portions of their base salary, commissions and cash bonuses. We maintain a deferral account for each participating employee on a fully vested basis for all employee deferrals. Participants can choose to have their cash benefits paid in one lump sum or in quarterly payments upon separation from service or death. Subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, participants may also elect scheduled and nonscheduled in-service withdrawals of compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2005, and the earnings and losses attributable thereto. Withdrawals of compensation deferred after December 31, 2004, and the earnings and losses attributable thereto, must be scheduled by the participant at the time the participant elects to defer such compensation. 
Participants allocate their deferrals among a variety of investment crediting options offered under the plan. The investment crediting rates are based upon the rates of return available under certain separate accounts offered through variable insurance products. 
For all participants who joined the Deferred Compensation Plan prior to December 31, 2001, the plan provides a pre-retirement life insurance benefit equal to the lesser of 15 times the amount deferred in the participant's first year of participation or $2 million. The life insurance benefit is reduced beginning at age 61 by 20% per year. Participants who join the plan after December 31, 2001 are not eligible for this insurance benefit. We pay a portion of the cost of such life insurance benefits. The plan is unfunded and unsecured.  The Deferred Compensation Plan was amended in 2010 to provide for Company contributions to the plan in the form of 401(k) restoration contributions. The amount of our 401(k) restorations contributions made to participant accounts is determined based on the amount of discretionary matching contributions that would be made under the 401(k) Plan if the participants' deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made under the 401(k) Plan, but without regard to the statutory limits that apply to the benefits that may be provided under the 401(k) Plan. There are currently no vesting limitations in the Deferred Compensation Plan.  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following tables describe payments and other benefits that would be provided to certain of our NEOs under the specified circumstances upon a change in control of us or their termination, assuming a termination or change in control occurred on December 31, 2018. For further discussion, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Change in Control Agreements" above.

(1)  In accordance with SEC rules, an excise tax calculation is not presented in this table as we do not provide a gross-up or tax reimbursement to our NEOs in connection with a change in control. Amounts payable in the event of a change in control may be subject to reduction under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Represents an amount equal to a multiple of annualized base salary in effect on the date employment terminates (the  "Severance Date") — two times annualized base salary in the case of Messrs. Martell and Sando; one-time annualized base salary in the case of Messrs. Balas and Pinkston, plus (ii) the same  multiple of target annual ICP amount in effect on the Severance Date (the "Severance Benefit"). The Severance Benefit will be payable in a lump sum equal to 7/24 (7/12 for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston) of the Severance Benefit on the seventh month  after the Severance Date with an additional 1/24 (1/12 for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston) of the Severance Benefit paid each month until the month which is 24 months for Messrs. Martell and Sando (12 months for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston) after the  Severance Date. Receipt of the benefit is contingent upon execution of a general release of claims and compliance with certain post-termination covenants, including a 24 month  post-termination non-competition covenant for Messrs. Martell and Sando (12 months for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston), and confidentiality provisions in the employment  agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Represents a multiple of base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination by us (three times base salary  for Messrs. Martell and Sando and two times base salary for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston) and a multiple of target annual cash bonus established for fiscal year (three times for Messrs. Martell and Sando; two times for Messrs. Balas and  Pinkston). Receipt of the benefit is contingent upon execution of a general release of claims.

Such payment is required to be paid within two and one half months following fiscal year end. Receipt of the benefit is  contingent upon execution of a general release of claims and compliance with certain post termination covenants, including a 24 month post-termination non-competition covenant, and confidentiality provisions  in the employment agreement for Messrs. Martell and Sando (12 months for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

(6)  Represents the value after acceleration of outstanding unvested RSUs based on our closing stock price on December 31,  2018 of $33.42. The outstanding unvested RSUs reported above will accelerate and vest on an involuntary termination without cause (whether before or after a change in control, although not all outstanding RSUs may vest on such a termination before a  change in control), retirement, death or disability. For certain terminations of employment, the accelerated vesting is subject to execution of a general release of claims and complies with certain  post-termination covenants, including a 24 month post-termination non-competition covenant, and confidentiality provisions in the  employment agreement for Messrs. Martell and Sando (12 months for Messrs. Balas and Pinkston).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  Represents the value after acceleration of all outstanding unvested PBRSUs based on our closing stock price on  December 31, 2018 of $33.42. All or a pro-rata portion of outstanding unvested PBRSUs will generally accelerate on death, disability or involuntary termination without cause following a change in control,  subject to attainment of the performance measures for any termination prior to a change in control. We have assumed that the target number of PBRSUs would become vested in connection with each acceleration event, although the actual number of PBRSUs  that could become vested could be higher or lower than the target number of PBRSUs, based on actual performance.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
Under Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company is required to provide the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Martell to the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company. The Company believes that there have been no changes to our employee population or compensation arrangements that would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. Therefore, as permitted by Regulation S-K, we are using the same median employee as that was identified on December 31, 2017. 
The median employee was a non-exempt, full-time employee located in the U.S. with an annual total compensation of $67,208 for 2018, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which includes base pay, overtime pay and the Company's matching contribution to that employee's 401(k) plan. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Martell, was $5,641,654 as reported in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 83.9 to 1. 
We believe that our pay ratio disclosure presented above is a reasonable estimate. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, our pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Rules adopted by the SEC require our officers, as defined under the relevant SEC rules, and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our issued and outstanding common stock, to file reports of their ownership, and changes in ownership, of our shares with the SEC on prescribed forms. Officers, directors and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners are required by the SEC's rules to furnish us with copies of all such forms they file with the SEC. 
Based solely on the review of the copies of the forms received by us, or written representations from reporting persons that they were not required to file a Form 5 to report previously unreported ownership or changes in ownership, we believe that our officers, directors and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners timely complied with all such filing requirements during fiscal 2018.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT VOTING 
Why have I been sent a notice regarding the availability of proxy materials on the Internet? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice to most of our stockholders. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. 
What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?

  1.  The election of the 11 persons named in this proxy statement to serve on the Board until the next annual meeting and  until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Our management and the Board are not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those set forth in this proxy statement and in the notice accompanying this proxy statement, nor have we received notice of any matter by the deadline prescribed by Rule 14a-4(c)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Without limiting our ability to apply the advance notice provisions in our Bylaws with respect to the procedures which must be followed for a matter to be properly presented at an annual meeting, if other matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
Does our Board have any recommendations with respect to the listed proposals? 
Our Board recommends you vote: (1) "FOR" the election of each of the 11 nominees for director; (2) "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs; and (3) "FOR" the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
Who may attend the Annual Meeting? 
Only our stockholders and their invited guests may attend the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you must bring proof of identification. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to provide proof of ownership — for example, a copy of a brokerage statement showing your share ownership — and proof of identification. Additional documentation is required to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting if you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee. See "How can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?" below for more information. 
Who is entitled to vote? 
Stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2019, the record date, or those with a valid proxy from a broker, bank or other nominee that held our shares on the record date are entitled to vote on the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. 
Who is a stockholder of record? 
A stockholder of record is a person or entity whose name appears as an owner of one or more shares of our common stock on the records of our transfer agent as of its close of business on the record date.  How can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting? 
If you hold shares as a stockholder of record, you have the right to vote those shares in person at the Annual Meeting. If you choose to do so, you can vote using the ballot provided at the Annual Meeting or, if you received a printed set of the proxy materials by mail, by submitting at the Annual Meeting the proxy card enclosed with the proxy materials you received. If you are a beneficial holder of shares, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares in person at the Annual Meeting using the ballot provided at the meeting. Please note that participants in our 401(k) Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan") may not vote their plan shares in person at the Annual Meeting. See "How are my shares in the Company's 401(k) Plan voted?" below for more information. 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
How many shares are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
As of the record date, 80,126,108 shares of our common stock were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many votes do I have? 
Each share of the Company's common stock, excluding treasury shares, is entitled to one vote on each of the 11 director nominees and on each other proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
How many directors can I vote for? 
Eleven. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders may vote "for" or "against" the election to our Board of each of the 11 nominees for director. Stockholders may also abstain from voting with respect to any of the 11 nominees for director. 
Who are the director nominees? 
The 11 director nominees are: J. David Chatham, Douglas C. Curling, John C. Dorman, Paul F. Folino, Frank D. Martell, Claudia Fan Munce, Thomas C. O'Brien, Vikrant Raina, Jaynie Miller Studenmund, David F. Walker, and Mary Lee Widener. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
Proposal 1 – Election of Directors 
Because the number of director nominees timely nominated for election at the Annual Meeting does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting, our Bylaws provide that each director nominee will be elected to the Board to serve until the next annual meeting and as soon thereafter as his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, if the nominee receives a majority of votes cast with respect to such director nominee's election. A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes "against" that director nominee. 
Proposal 2 – Approval, on an Advisory Basis, of the Compensation of our NEOs 
Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (meaning that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, a majority of them must be voted "for" the proposal for it to be approved).  Proposal 3 – Ratification of the Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2019 
The selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 will be ratified if the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (meaning that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal, a majority of them must be voted "for" the proposal for it to be approved). 
How do I vote? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote on matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting in one of four ways: 
You may vote over the Internet. 
You do this by following the instructions provided either in the Notice or on the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement if you received a printed set of the proxy materials. If you submit your proxy over the Internet, your shares will be voted as you instruct. You do not have to separately mail in your proxy card. 
You may vote by mail. 
If you received a printed set of the proxy materials, you do this by signing and dating the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement and mailing it in the enclosed, prepaid and addressed envelope within the required time. If you mark your voting instructions on the proxy card, your shares will be voted as you instruct. 
You may vote by telephone. 
You do this by following the instructions provided on the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement if you received a printed set of the proxy materials. If you submit your proxy by telephone, your shares will be voted as you instruct. You do not have to separately mail in your proxy card. 
You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
You can vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. If you choose to do so, you can vote using the ballot provided at the Annual Meeting, or, if you requested and received printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you can complete, sign and date the proxy card enclosed with the proxy materials you received and submit it at the Annual Meeting. 
If you hold your shares in "street name," you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order to instruct how your shares are to be voted at the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in "street name," you may also attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person, provided that you request and receive, prior to the Annual Meeting, a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting and present the legal proxy at the meeting prior to voting. If your shares are held through the 401(k) Plan, please see "How are my shares in the Company's 401(k) Plan voted?" below. 
How are my shares in the Company's 401(k) Plan voted? 
For those stockholders who hold shares pursuant to the 401(k) Plan, Fidelity Management Trust Company ("Fidelity") acts as trustee for shares held in the 401(k) Plan. The governing documents of the 401(k) Plan require Fidelity, as trustee, to vote the shares as directed by the plan participants for whose benefit the shares are held. Fidelity will use an independent third party to tabulate the voting directions of all participants who provide such directions to Fidelity. Neither the tabulator nor Fidelity will provide the individual or aggregate participant voting directions to the Company, unless otherwise required by law. Shares for which no direction is received by Fidelity from the participants by April 25, 2019 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, will be voted in the same proportion as are the shares for which directions are received by that time.  How will my shares be voted if I do not provide specific voting instructions in the proxy I submit? 
The named proxy holders, Frank D. Martell or Arnold A. Pinkston, will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board with respect to the three proposals included in this proxy statement and as such proxy holders may determine in accordance with their best judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
You have the power to change or revoke your proxy at any time before the polls close at the Annual Meeting. Only your latest-dated proxy counts. You may do this by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting an authorized proxy bearing a later date using one of the alternatives described above under "How do I  vote?";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you are a stockholder of record, submitting written notice of your revocation to Arnold A. Pinkston, Chief Legal Officer  and Corporate Secretary, at our mailing address on the cover page of this proxy statement; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting, provided that if your shares are held in "street name" (in the name of a  bank, broker or other nominee), you have obtained a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself constitute  revocation of a proxy.  
[END TABLE]
Who will count the votes? 
A representative of Alliance Advisors, LLC will serve as inspector of elections and will tabulate the votes cast at the Annual Meeting and certify the results. 
How can I obtain an additional proxy card? 
If you lose, misplace or otherwise need to obtain a proxy card, and you are a stockholder of record, please contact our proxy solicitor, Alliance Advisors, toll-free at 1-855-325-6671. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held indirectly through a broker, bank or other nominee, please contact your account representative at that organization. 
What constitutes a "quorum?" 
A "quorum" refers to the number of shares that must be represented at a meeting in order to lawfully conduct business. Holders of a majority in voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Without a quorum, no business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. 
What is a "broker non-vote" and how is it treated? 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" by a broker and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may vote your shares at the Annual Meeting only on "routine matters" (as defined by NYSE rules) on which it has discretion to vote. The NYSE currently considers only Proposal 3 — the proposal to ratify the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 — to be a "routine matter." The following proposals are considered "non-routine matters" under the NYSE rules: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the election to the Board of the 11 director nominees named in this proxy statement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, if your shares are held in "street name" and your broker has not received voting instructions from you, your broker may exercise its discretion to vote your shares on the proposal to ratify the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm, but will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of the   other proposals at the Annual Meeting. If your broker exercises this discretion, your shares will be treated as present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting for purposes of establishing the presence or absence of a quorum and voted on the proposal to ratify the selection of PwC in the manner directed by the broker, but will constitute "broker non-votes" on each of the other proposals at the Annual Meeting. These broker non-votes will not be counted in determining the outcome of any of the other proposals. 
How are abstentions treated? 
For the election of directors, you may vote "for," "against," or "abstain" with respect to each director nominee. If you elect to "abstain" from the election of directors, the abstention will not have any effect on the election of directors. In determining the voting results for the election of directors, only "for" and "against" votes count. 
For purposes of the proposals regarding the vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs, and the vote to ratify the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, abstentions are treated as present and entitled to vote. Therefore, with respect to each of these proposals, abstentions have the effect of votes "AGAINST" the proposal. 
Who is paying the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the notice of the annual meeting of stockholders, proxy statement and form of proxy, and the solicitation of the proxies? 
We will pay the costs associated with the preparation, assembly and mailing of the Notice, proxy statement and form of proxy, as well as the cost of soliciting proxies relating to the annual meeting. We will also pay brokers, banks and other nominees for the reasonable expenses of forwarding solicitation materials to their customers who own shares of our common stock. In addition to this proxy statement, our directors, officers and other regular administrative employees may solicit proxies. None of them will receive any additional compensation for such solicitation. We may conduct further solicitations of stockholders by telephone, e-mail, through press releases issued by us, advertisements in periodicals or postings on our website at www.corelogic.com through our officers, directors and employees, none of whom will receive additional compensation for assisting with the solicitation. We have also retained Alliance Advisors to assist in the solicitation of proxies and related services, for a fee estimated to be approximately $19,500 plus an amount to cover expenses. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement. 
How do I obtain a separate set of proxy materials if I share an address with other stockholders? 
To reduce expenses, in some cases, we are delivering one set of proxy materials to certain stockholders who share an address, unless otherwise requested. Upon oral or written request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of the proxy materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of proxy materials was delivered. If you are a stockholder of record at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of the proxy materials and you desire to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, including our 2018 Annual Report, for the Annual Meeting or for our future meetings of stockholders, or if you are a stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered multiple copies of the proxy materials and you desire to receive one copy in the future, please submit your request to:

If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee directly if you have questions, require additional copies of the proxy materials, or wish to request single or multiple copies of the proxy materials in the future.  Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results as soon as possible after the Annual Meeting.

APPENDIX A – UNAUDITED RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
This proxy statement contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and FCF, which are provided only as supplemental information. The Company uses these non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the Company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, non-operating gains/losses, and other adjustments. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted income from continuing operations, net of tax per share, adjusted for share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, non-operating gains/losses, and other adjustments; and assumes an effective tax rate of 26% and 35% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for U.S. GAAP. Other firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than CoreLogic, which limits comparability between companies.
