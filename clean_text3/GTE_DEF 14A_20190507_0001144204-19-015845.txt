Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement
Tuesday, May 7, 2019
11:00 a.m. (Mountain Time)
Centennial Place,
3rd Floor, West Tower,
250 - 5 Street SW,
Calgary, AB, Canada
TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS,
We invite you to attend the Annual Meeting of Gran Tierra Energy Inc., ("Gran Tierra" or the "Company") which will be held at Centennial Place, 3rd Floor, West Tower, 250 - 5 Street SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R4 on May 7, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. Mountain Time.
The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement describes the business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we urge you to submit your vote via the internet, telephone or mail.
I encourage you to read our 2018 Annual Report for additional information. Following the formal portion of the Annual Meeting, management will review Gran Tierra's operational and financial performance during 2018 and provide an outlook on priorities for 2019 and beyond. You will also have an opportunity to ask questions and to meet the directors and our executives.
At the meeting, I look forward to sharing with you information about the Company's strong performance during 2018. In 2018, our returns-focused strategy with an emphasis on profitable production growth generated strong financial results. Gran Tierra's high-quality, operated, diversified suite of assets in Colombia delivered material year-on-year improvements in several important metrics, including a 15% increase in production to 36,209 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 424% increase in net income to $103 million, or $0.26 per share basic and diluted, and a 45% increase in oil and gas sales to $613 million. As well, return on capital employed increased to 12% from 8% in 2017.
As we look to 2019 and beyond, we remain focused on creating long-term shareholder value, which we believe is achieved by focusing on capital efficiency and returns on invested capital. We believe that our focused strategy is delivering results on several fronts and that Gran Tierra is well positioned for an exciting year of growth in 2019 and beyond as we continue to create value in multi-horizon, proven hydrocarbon basins that have access to infrastructure.
On behalf of our Board of Directors and the team at Gran Tierra, I want to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support.
Sincerely,
/s/ Gary S. Guidry

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND 2019 ANNUAL MEETING
Why am I receiving these materials?
We are sending you these proxy materials because the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Gran Tierra Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Gran Tierra" or the "Company"), is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, including at any adjournments or postponements of the annual meeting. You are invited to attend the annual meeting to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the annual meeting to vote your shares. Instead, if you are a stockholder of record of our common stock, you may simply complete, sign and return the proxy card, or follow the instructions below to submit your proxy over the telephone or through the internet. See "How do I vote" below for further information on how to vote, including if you hold our common stock through a broker in "street name" or hold exchangeable shares.
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the internet. We are sending to our stockholders of record the proxy materials, including this proxy statement and an annual report, or a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"). We intend that our stockholders who hold their stock in "street name" will receive a Notice from their broker, bank or other agent in which they hold the stock in "street name," unless they have specified otherwise. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice.
We intend to mail the proxy materials and Notice beginning on March 26, 2019, to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting. We expect that the Notice will be sent to stockholders who hold their stock in "street name" on or about this same date.
How do I attend the annual meeting?
The meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. (Mountain time) at Centennial Place, 3rd Floor, West Tower, 250-5 Street SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R4. Directions to the annual meeting may be found at http://www.grantierra.com/ investor-relations/2019-annual-meeting.html. Information on how to vote in person at the annual meeting is discussed below.
Who can vote at the annual meeting?
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019, will be entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On this record date, there were 386,335,507 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
Stockholders of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If at the close of business on March 15, 2019, your shares were registered directly in your name with Gran Tierra's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the annual meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to fill out and return the proxy or vote by proxy by telephone or on the internet as instructed below to ensure your vote is counted.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If at the close of business on March 15, 2019, your shares were held, not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and the Notice, and/or these proxy materials if you have received them, are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the annual meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.
What am I voting on?
There are three matters scheduled for a vote:
What if another matter is properly brought before the annual meeting?
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.
How do I vote?
You may either vote "For" or "Against" or abstain from voting with respect to each nominee to the Board and each of the other matters to be voted on.
Stockholders of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the annual meeting, vote by proxy on the internet or by telephone, or vote by proxy using a proxy card that you may request or that we may elect to deliver at a later time. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the annual meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, you should have received a Notice containing voting instructions, or these proxy materials and an annual report and form of proxy, from that organization rather than from Gran Tierra. Simply follow the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank, or other agent to ensure that your vote is counted. If you have received these proxy materials and voting instructions therein, simply complete and mail the voting instructions to ensure that your vote is counted. Alternatively, if permitted by your broker or bank, you may vote by telephone or on the internet as instructed by your broker, bank or other agent. To vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank, or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker, bank, or other agent included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker, bank, or other agent to request a proxy form.
How many votes do I have?
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of common stock you own as of March 15, 2019. Cumulative voting is not permitted.
What if I return a proxy card or otherwise vote but do not make specific choices?
Stockholder of Record; Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a holder of record and return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise vote without marking voting selections, your shares will be voted, as applicable, "For" the election of all eight nominees for director, "For" the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and "For" the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation. If any other matter is properly presented at the annual meeting, your proxyholder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment.
Beneficial Owner; Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, and you do not provide the broker or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, your broker or other nominee may not vote your shares on any proposal other than the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm at the annual meeting. See "What are 'broker non-votes'?" below. We encourage you to provide voting instructions to the organization that holds your shares to ensure that your vote is counted on all three proposals.
What happens if I do not vote?
Stockholder of Record; Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record and do not vote by completing your proxy card, by telephone, over the internet or in person at the annual meeting, your shares will not be voted.
Beneficial Owner; Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If you hold your shares in "street name," you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee describing how to vote your shares. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, they may vote your shares as they decide as to each matter for which they have discretionary authority under the rules of the NYSE American. This year, the only matter with respect to which they may vote your shares without voting instructions is the proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2).
There are also non-discretionary matters for which brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote unless they receive timely instructions from you. When a broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretion to vote on a particular matter and you have not given timely instructions on how the broker, bank or other nominee should vote your shares, a "broker non-vote" results. Although any broker non-vote would be counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, it would be treated as not entitled to vote with respect to non-discretionary matters.
If your shares are held in "street name" and you do not give voting instructions, pursuant to NYSE American Company Guide Section 723, the record holder will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to Proposals 1 or 3. If your shares are held in "street name" and you do not give voting instructions, the record holder will nevertheless be entitled to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 2.
Abstentions occur when stockholders are present at the annual meeting but voluntarily abstain on any of the matters upon which the stockholders are voting.
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or more than one set of proxy materials?
If you receive more than one Notice or more than one set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in different accounts. Please follow the voting instructions on the Notices or the instructions on the proxy cards in the proxy materials to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?
Stockholder of Record; Shares Registered in Your Name
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the annual meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
Your most current proxy card or telephone or internet proxy is the one that is counted.
Beneficial Owner; Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker or bank.
When are stockholder proposals due for next year's annual meeting?
Stockholders who desire to present proposals at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and to have proposals included in our proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must submit their proposals to us at our principal executive offices (to the Corporate Secretary at 900, 520 - 3rd Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R3), not later than the close of business on November 27, 2019. If the date of the 2020 annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the 2019 annual meeting, the deadline for submitting proposals is a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail the proxy materials for our 2020 annual meeting.
Our Bylaws provide that stockholders may nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors or bring any other business before the stockholders at the 2020 annual meeting only by sending to our Corporate Secretary a notice containing the information required by our Bylaws. Notice to us must be made not less than 30 or more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that if the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made by Gran Tierra, notice may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by Gran Tierra. Detailed information about how to make stockholder proposals or nominations for our annual meetings of stockholders can be found in our Bylaws.
How are votes counted?
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the annual meeting, who will separately count, for the proposal to elect directors and the other proposals, votes "For," "Against," abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Broker non-votes have no effect and will not be counted towards the vote total for any proposal.
What are "broker non-votes"?
As discussed above, when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed by the NYSE American to be "non-routine," the broker or nominee cannot vote the shares. These unvoted shares are counted as "broker non-votes." Each of Proposal 1 and Proposal 3 is considered non-routine and a broker will lack the authority to vote shares at his/her discretion on such proposals. Proposal 2 is considered a routine matter and a broker will be permitted to exercise his/her discretion.
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if stockholders holding outstanding shares of Gran Tierra's capital stock representing at least a majority of the total number of votes that may be cast at the annual meeting are present at the annual meeting in person or represented by proxy. On the record date, there were 386,335,507 votes that could be cast. Thus, holders of outstanding shares representing at least 193,167,754 votes must be present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting to have a quorum.
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the Chairman of the annual meeting or the holders of a majority of shares present at the annual meeting in person or represented by proxy must adjourn the annual meeting to another date.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the annual meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file within four business days after the annual meeting.
What proxy materials are available on the internet?
The notice of meeting, proxy statement and annual report to stockholders are available to view at:
http://www.edocumentview.com/GTE
or on Gran Tierra's website at: http://www.grantierra.com
See "How do I vote?" above for voting instructions.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
PROPOSAL 1:

The Board of Directors is nominating the eight individuals identified below for election as directors. Unless you specify differently, proxies received will be voted FOR Robert B. Hodgins, Peter J. Dey, Gary S. Guidry, Evan Hazell, Ronald W. Royal, Sondra Scott, David P. Smith and Brooke Wade. Each director to be elected and qualified will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected, or, if sooner, until the director's death, resignation or removal.

Majority Voting Standard
Our Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections, which is generally defined as an election in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Because this is an uncontested election, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present. A "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "For" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "Against" that director nominee. For these purposes, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as a vote "For" or "Against" a nominee's election and will have no effect in determining whether a director nominee has received a majority of the votes cast. If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast, the incumbent director must promptly tender his or her or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the director's resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall recommend, and the Board of Directors' decision shall be, to accept the resignation absent exceptional circumstances. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days from the date of the meeting of stockholders and publicly disclose its decision If the Board of Directors determines not to accept a resignation, the public disclosure shall fully state the reasons for such decision. A director who tenders his or her or her resignation after failing to receive a majority of the votes cast will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's or the Board's recommendation or decision or any deliberations related thereto.
Other Information Regarding Our Directors
Our above-listed directors have neither been convicted in any criminal proceeding during the past ten years nor been parties to any judicial or administrative proceeding during the past ten years that resulted in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining them from future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or a finding of any violation of federal or state securities law or commodities law. Similarly, no bankruptcy petitions have been filed by or against any business or property of any of our directors or officers, nor has any bankruptcy petition been filed against a partnership or business association in which these persons were general partners or executive officers.
Skills Matrix
Below is a listing of each director's key skills, together with a description of those key skills and experience desirable to support the strategic direction of Gran Tierra. Not every director is expected to be skilled in every area, however, we aim for the Board to have a balance of skills and experience.

The Board conducts an annual review regarding the independence from the Company's management of each of its members. After review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and Gran Tierra, its senior management and its independent auditors, the Board has affirmatively determined that, other than Mr. Guidry, each of our directors and nominees for director (Peter J. Dey, Evan Hazell, Robert B. Hodgins, Ronald W. Royal, Sondra Scott, David P. Smith and Brooke Wade), are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable NYSE American listing standards. In making this determination, the Board found that none of these directors or nominees for director had a material or other disqualifying relationship with Gran Tierra. Mr. Guidry, Gran Tierra's President and Chief Executive Officer, is not an independent director by virtue of his employment with Gran Tierra.
In connection with its assessment of the independence of each non-employee director, the Board of Directors also determined that (i) Messrs. Smith, Hazell, Hodgins and Royal, are independent as defined in Section 10A of the Exchange Act and under the standards set forth by the NYSE American applicable to members of the Audit Committee (ii) Messrs. Wade, Dey, Hodgins and Smith, are independent under the standards set forth by the NYSE American applicable to members of the Compensation Committee and (iii) Ms. Scott and Messrs. Dey, Hodgins and Wade, are independent under the standards set forth by the NYSE American applicable to members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. During 2018, the Board considered and confirmed that Mr. Hodgins' position as Senior Advisor, Investment Banking at Canaccord Genuity Corp. did not impede his independence as a Director of the Company.
Stockholder Recommendations and Nominations to the Board
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth on page 24 in the section Considerations in Evaluating Director Nominees based on whether or not the candidate was recommended by a stockholder. Stockholders who wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to become nominees for election to the Board may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at the following address: Gran Tierra Energy Inc., 900, 520 - 3 Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R3, Attention: Director Nominations. This written recommendation must be delivered at least 120 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing of Gran Tierra's proxy statement for the last annual meeting of stockholders. Submissions must include the full name of the proposed nominee, a description of the proposed nominee's business experience for at least the previous five years, complete biographical information, a description of the proposed nominee's qualifications as a director and a representation that the nominating stockholder is a beneficial or record holder of Gran Tierra's stock. Any such submission must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
Code of Ethics
Gran Tierra has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which is available in English and Spanish and applies to every employee, officer and director. Employees, officers and directors are expected to understand the Code and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company's website at www.grantierra. com/governance. If Gran Tierra makes any substantive amendments to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or grants any waiver from a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any executive officer or director, Gran Tierra will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on its website. The Board did not grant any waiver of the Code in favor of a director or executive officer in 2018.
Diversity
Gran Tierra believes in the importance of diversity at all levels throughout the Company. In addition to the traditional concepts of diversity (i.e., gender, culture and geographic region), we believe it is important for the Board to achieve a diversity of knowledge, experience and capabilities that support the Company's strategic direction. Currently, Gran Tierra does not have a formal policy concerning the diversity of director nominees. However, when considering director candidates, the Board seeks individuals with backgrounds and qualities that, when combined with those of incumbent directors, provide a blend of skills and experience to further enhance the Board's effectiveness. As part of its annual self-evaluation, the Board assesses whether the directors, both individually and collectively, provide the integrity, experience, judgment, commitment, skills and expertise appropriate for the Company.
THE BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Role of the Board of Directors
The Board is selected by the stockholders to provide oversight of and strategic guidance to senior management. The core responsibility of a Board member is to fulfill his or her or her fiduciary duties of care and loyalty and otherwise to exercise his or her business judgment in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board has responsibilities to review, approve and monitor fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions, assess major risks facing the Company and consider ways to address those risks, select and oversee management and determine its composition and oversee the establishment and maintenance of processes and conditions to maintain the integrity of the Company. Directors must act with integrity and are expected to demonstrate a commitment to the company, its values and its business and to long-term stockholder value. The duties and responsibilities of the Board and significant issues of corporate governance are set out in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines which are regularly reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The guidelines are available on the Company's website at www.grantierra.com/governance.
Succession Planning
As part of its mandate and annual workplan, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the succession plan for each senior officer, including the President and Chief Executive Officer. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that there is an orderly succession plan for the position of the President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. To meet this obligation, the President and Chief Executive Officer meets with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and reviews each position, the status of the incumbent, a review of our talent pool and the succession plan for each role.
Board Role in Risk Oversight
The full Board is entrusted with the responsibility for overseeing the significant risks to which our business is exposed and ensuring there are processes in place to effectively identify, monitor and manage them. A significant risk is one that, if it were to occur, could materially impact our ability to meet or support our business objectives. The Board delegates responsibility for the execution of certain elements of risk oversight to the committees in order to ensure appropriate expertise, attention and diligence. The committees oversee the relevant risk areas and report to the Board regularly. Each committee operates according to a Board-approved written mandate outlining its duties and responsibilities. They also oversee the procedures and programs put in place by management to mitigate the risks and the allocation of adequate resources to address the risks. Management is responsible for ensuring that the Board and its committees are kept well informed of changing risks. The risk oversight responsibilities of the committees include the following:
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditor, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, major financial and information technology risk exposures and the Company's accounting and financing reporting processes.
The Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight of compensation-related risks, including reviewing management's assessment of risks related to employee compensation programs.
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee assists in overseeing the development, monitoring and effective implementation of systems, programs and initiatives to promote the management of health, safety and security at Gran Tierra and to address environmental, safety and operational risks. Additional information can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Report which is available on the Company's website at http://www.grantierra.com/corporate-responsibility.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists in overseeing governance related risks, including regulatory, reputation and other risks.
The Reserves Committee assists in overseeing the risks related to the Company's estimates of proved reserves of oil and natural gas. 
Communications with the Board of Directors
The Board has adopted a formal process by which stockholders and other interested persons may communicate with the Board or any of its directors. This information is available on Gran Tierra's website at www.grantierra.com/governance.
BOARD STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES
Board Leadership Structure
Robert B. Hodgins currently serves as non-executive Chairman of our Board. The Board believes that the current board leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on board independence, effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and the independent members of our Board. We believe separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer helps preserve our Board's independence and objectivity and provides an appropriate division of labor between our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of our Board presides over meetings of the Board, presides over meetings of stockholders, consults and advises the Board and its committees on the business and affairs of the Company, and performs additional duties as the Board may otherwise determine and delegate.
Board Effectiveness and Director Assessment
The Board performs an annual self-assessment, led by the Chair of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, to evaluate its effectiveness in fulfilling its obligations. Directors complete a written questionnaire covering performance of the Board and its committees. The Chair of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee then interviews each director to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of the Board and committees, as well as director performance and Board dynamics, summarizes these individual assessments for discussion with the Board and committees, and then leads a discussion with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board.
Considerations in Evaluating Director Nominees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and recruiting new candidates for nomination to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers recommendations for nominees for directorships submitted by stockholders. The Company will evaluate director nominees proposed by stockholders on the same basis as recommendations received from any other source. Please see "Stockholder Proposals" in this Proxy Statement and our Bylaws for procedures to submit director nominees to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
In developing recommendations for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors. Candidates for director nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of Gran Tierra and the long-term interests of stockholders. Some of the qualifications that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers include:
In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers diversity, age, skills, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the Board and Gran Tierra, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that candidates should have certain minimum qualifications including:
To identify, recruit and evaluate qualified candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may use the services of professional search firms. In some cases, nominees have been individuals known to Board members or others through business or other relationships.
Director Tenure
Gran Tierra does not have a retirement policy or term limit for directors. We review our Board composition annually to ensure our board has the right skills to ensure the Company's long-term success. None of the Company's directors have served on the board for more than four years.
Orientation and Education
The purpose of the Director Orientation and Education Program is to ensure there is an orientation program for new directors and an ongoing education program for existing directors. The program includes materials and resources that will inform and educate directors on the Company's corporate governance framework, its business, operations and current issues and strategies. New directors are provided with a copy of the Company's director's manual which includes the Board and Committee mandates, corporate governance guidelines and other company policies. New directors attend an orientation session at which senior management review the Company's business, strategic plans, its significant financial, accounting and risk management issues, its compliance programs, its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, its principal officers, and its internal and independent auditors.
Each director is expected to maintain the necessary level of expertise to perform his or her responsibilities as a director. Continuing education is provided through a number of methods, including an annual dedicated strategy session, periodic field trips, presentations from senior management, employees, and outside experts to the Board and its Committees on topics of interest and developing issues, as well as the ongoing distribution of relevant information. These presentations, meetings and discussions serve to increase the Board's knowledge of the Company and its business, and assist the Board in the execution of its duties. 
Director Meetings and Attendance
Directors are expected to attend, in person or by telephone, all meetings of the Board and all meetings of each committee of which they are a member. During fiscal 2018, the Board held nine meetings, the Audit Committee held five meetings, the Compensation Committee held three meetings, the Health, Safety and Environment Committee held four meetings, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings and the Reserves Committee held two meetings. No member of the Board attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which he or she was a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which such director served (held during the period that such director served). Directors are expected to attend the Company's annual meeting of stockholders and all of the Company's directors attended the 2018 annual meeting.
Executive Sessions
As part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the independent directors meet without our management team. The Chairman leads such discussions.
INFORMATION REGARDING COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board has five standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Health, Safety and Environment Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and a Reserves Committee. The composition and responsibilities are described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by the Board.
The committees regularly report their activities and actions to the full Board, generally at the next Board meeting following the committee meeting. Each of the committees operates under a charter approved by the Board. Current copies of the charters of the committees are available on the Company's website at www.grantierra.com/governance.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of the Compensation Committee has at any time been an officer or employee of Gran Tierra. No member of the Board or of the Compensation Committee served as an executive officer of another entity that had one or more of our executive officers serving as a member of that entity's board or compensation committee.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The objective of Gran Tierra's compensation program for non-executive directors is to attract and retain directors of a quality and nature that will enhance our long-term sustainable profitability and growth. Director compensation is intended to provide an appropriate level of remuneration considering the experience, responsibilities, time commitment and accountability of their roles. Any director who is also an employee of the Company does not receive additional compensation for serving as a director.
Non-executive director compensation is reviewed annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to ensure that it is reasonable in light of the time required from directors and aligns directors' interests with those of our stockholders.
In addition, we align the interests of our directors with our stockholders by requiring that Directors own a minimum number of shares or Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs" and each a "DSU"). Each non-executive director must hold shares or DSUs with a value equal to three times the annual cash retainer. The shareholdings of each non-executive director are valued using either the closing price of our shares on December 31 each year or the value at the time they were acquired, whichever is greater. Directors have five years to meet the share ownership requirement.
Directors' DSU Plan
The DSU plan allows directors to defer receipt of their fees and invest such deferred amounts in notional shares of Gran Tierra. Directors who have elected to be paid all or a portion of the annual retainer in DSUs receive their awards on a quarterly basis effective the first day of each quarter. The number of DSUs credited to each director is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the portion of the director's retainer that he or she has elected to be paid in the form of DSUs by the fair market value on the day of determination. The DSUs vest immediately but are not paid out until the director ceases to be a director of Gran Tierra. The Board has discretion to settle the DSUs in common shares or in a cash amount equal to the market value of common shares at the time of settlement. DSUs are not shares and do not carry voting rights. DSUs received by directors in lieu of cash compensation and held by them represent an at-risk investment in Gran Tierra. The value of DSUs is based on the value of the common shares of Gran Tierra, and therefore is not guaranteed.
Fees and Retainers for 2018
The director compensation structure for non-executive directors is comprised of an all-inclusive Board retainer that consists of both a cash component and an equity component. Each of these components is described below in more detail.
The cash retainer portion of the director's fees can be taken in the form of cash, restricted stock Units ("RSUs"), DSUs or any combination thereof, as elected by each non-employee director. The equity portion must be taken in the form of equity until the stock ownership guideline is achieved. A maximum of 25% of the equity retainer can be taken as stock options which vest immediately and expire after five years. DSUs vest immediately but are not paid out until the director ceases to be a director of Gran Tierra and RSUs vest and are paid out after three years. The number of DSUs, RSUs or stock options credited to each director is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the portion of the director's retainer to be paid in the form of DSUs, RSUs or stock options by the fair market value on the day of determination. A travel fee is paid to each director for travel over three hours to a Board meeting.
Director Compensation Table

We maintain an insurance policy for directors' and officers' liability. It provides coverage for costs incurred to defend and settle claims against directors or officers up to an annual limit of $100 million. The cost of coverage for 2018 was approximately $453,294. Directors and officers do not pay any portion of the premiums. No claims were made or became payable in 2018.
AUDIT- RELATED MATTERS
PROPOSAL 2:
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Audit Committee of the Board has selected KPMG LLP as Gran Tierra's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and has further directed that management submit the selection of independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting.
Neither Gran Tierra's Bylaws nor other governing documents or law require stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Gran Tierra's independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Audit Committee of the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee of the Board will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee of the Board in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Gran Tierra and its stockholders.
Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from stockholders raised at the meeting.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 2.
CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
As previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K, on March 12, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the dismissal of Deloitte LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. On March 12, 2018, the Company notified Deloitte of its dismissal effective immediately. Also, on March 12, 2018, the Committee approved the engagement of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. KPMG LLP was formally engaged on March 12, 2018.
Deloitte LLP's reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and in the subsequent interim period through the Dismissal Date, there were (i) no disagreements between the Company and Deloitte LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte LLP, would have caused Deloitte LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its reports on the consolidated financial statements for such years and (ii) no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). The Company provided Deloitte LLP with a copy of the disclosure from its Current Report on Form 8-K, and requested that Deloitte LLP furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether Deloitte LLP agrees with the disclosures contained in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. The Company received the requested letter from Deloitte LLP and a copy of Deloitte LLP's letter was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K.
Furthermore, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the subsequent interim period through the Dismissal Date, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with KPMG LLP regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that KPMG LLP concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board comprised solely of independent directors as required by the listing standards of the NYSE American and rules of the SEC. In accordance with the written Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices or the Company.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, with management of Gran Tierra and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's financial statements, and the independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for the audit of those statements. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the accounting firm's independence. Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in Gran Tierra's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Respectfully submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
David P. Smith, Chair
Evan Hazell

Ronald W. Royal
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES
The aggregate fees paid by the Company to KPMG LLP (after March 12, 2018) and Deloitte LLP (before March 12, 2018) each an Independent Registered Public Accounting firm, and the independent auditors of Gran Tierra at relevant times, for professional services rendered in Gran Tierra's last two fiscal years are as follows. In determining the independence of KPMG LLP and/or Deloitte LLP, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining KPMG LLP and/or Deloitte LLP's independence.
Audit Fees
Audit Fees are primarily for the annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K, including the audit of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, the reviews of the Company's financial statements included in the Forms 10-Qs, statutory audits, and other procedures required to be performed by the independent auditor to be able to form an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Audit-Related Fees
Audit-Related Fees include fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. Audit-Related fees paid in 2018 were in connection to the Company's note offering. Audit-Related Fees in 2017 were in connection with the Company's note offering, dispositions of Brazil and Peru operations, working interest and Block assignments in Colombia, branch wind-ups in Colombia and Mexican bid round.
Tax Fees
Tax fees were for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning
All Other Fees
All other fees related to products and services provided by KPMG LLP and/or Deloitte LLP other than those described as "Audit fees", "Audit-related fees" and "Tax fees". For 2017, other fees include French translation services.
All services described above were approved by the Audit Committee.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the engagement of the independent auditors and for approving, in advance, all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee maintains a policy for the engagement of independent auditors that is intended to maintain the independence from Gran Tierra of the independent auditors. In adopting this policy, our Audit Committee considered the various services that independent auditors have historically performed or may be needed to perform in the future for Gran Tierra. Under this policy:
In its review of all non-audit service fees, our Audit Committee considers, among other things, the possible effect of these services on the independence of our independent auditors. Relevant considerations include, but are not limited to, whether the services are prohibited pursuant to SEC rules, whether the auditors are best positioned to provide the services, and the percentage of total services the non-audit services will comprise.
Any approval required under this policy must be given by our Audit Committee or by the chairperson of the Audit Committee in office at the time, provided that any pre-approval decisions made by the chairperson must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Gran Tierra's Audit Committee will not delegate its responsibilities to approve services performed by the independent auditors to any member of management. All services rendered by Deloitte LLP and KPMG LLP in 2018 were subject to our pre-approval policy.
PROPOSAL 3:
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Gran Tierra's stockholders are entitled to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Gran Tierra's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of Gran Tierra's named executive officers for the last completed fiscal year and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
The compensation of Gran Tierra's named executive officers subject to the vote is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables that follow, and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. As discussed in those disclosures, Gran Tierra believes that its compensation policies and decisions are consistent with current market practices and are focused on pay-for-performance principles that strongly align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders. Compensation of Gran Tierra's named executive officers is designed to enable Gran Tierra to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead Gran Tierra successfully in a competitive environment.
Accordingly, the Board is asking the stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of Gran Tierra's named executive officers as described in this proxy statement by casting a non-binding advisory vote "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Gran Tierra's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED."
Because the vote is advisory, it is not binding on the Board or Gran Tierra. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the stockholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the Compensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding executive compensation arrangements. At the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders indicated their preference that Gran Tierra solicit a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers every year. Therefore, unless the Company modifies its policy on the frequency of holding such a vote, the next non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers is expected to occur in 2020.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 3.

Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Gran Tierra's directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of Gran Tierra's equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports disclosing the amount and nature of their beneficial ownership and reports of changes of their beneficial ownership of common stock and other equity securities of Gran Tierra.
To Gran Tierra's knowledge, based solely on a review of these reports and written representations from these individuals that no other reports were required, Gran Tierra believes that all required filings were timely made in 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following discussion provides details regarding our executive compensation program and 2018 compensation arrangements for each of our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") who, in 2018 were:
Philosophy and Objectives of our Executive Compensation Program
Our compensation philosophy is to provide an attractive, flexible, and market-based total compensation program that is tied to performance and aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders. The Company's objective is to recruit and retain the caliber of executive officers and other key employees necessary to deliver sustained high performance to our stockholders as well as economic growth and respect for the communities in which we have a strong presence. Our compensation philosophy also serves as a means of communicating our goals and standards of conduct and performance, and for motivating and rewarding our NEOs in relation to their achievements. Our compensation philosophy includes the principles described below:

[END TABLE]
The Board and the Compensation Committee hold regular executive sessions at the end of each meeting with no representatives of the management team present. Our Chief Executive Officer does not attend any portion of the Compensation Committee or Board meeting at which his compensation is deliberated or approved. Except as described in the table above, our Chief Executive Officer does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation.
The agenda for each meeting is usually developed by the Chair of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. However, from time to time, various members of management and other employees as well as outside advisors or consultants may be invited by the Compensation Committee to make presentations, to provide financial or other background information or advice or to otherwise participate in Compensation Committee meetings. The charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation Committee full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of Gran Tierra. In addition, under the charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to obtain, at the expense of Gran Tierra, advice and assistance from compensation consultants, internal and external legal, accounting or other advisors and other external resources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate in the performance of its duties. The Compensation Committee has direct responsibility for the oversight of the work of any advisers engaged for the purpose of advising the Compensation Committee and may amend the engagement with or terminate any such advisor as it deems necessary or appropriate. Under its charter, the Compensation Committee may form, and delegate authority to, subcommittees, as appropriate. In 2018, the Compensation Committee did not form any subcommittees.
The Compensation Committee and the Board make their compensation decisions for the upcoming year, and review performance for the prior year, generally in the first quarter of the year. For example, annual bonuses in respect of 2018 performance were recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board in January of 2019.
Assessment of Company Performance
The Compensation Committee uses Company performance measures to establish total compensation ranges relative to our performance and the performance of our comparator groups as outlined on the following page. In addition, the Compensation Committee establishes specific performance measures that determine payouts under cash and equity-based incentive programs.
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant
When making determinations regarding executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers advice from external advisors and third-party compensation surveys as well as the advice of Compensation Committee members and other members of the Board based on their knowledge and experience to set competitive, results driven levels of salary and other compensation.
The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of independent compensation consultants or other external advisors and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation arrangements and oversight of the work of any such person. The retention of independent compensation consultants and scope of services provided by them are assessed on an annual basis.
The Compensation Committee may select a compensation consultant only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that person's independence from management. We will provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Compensation Committee, for payment of reasonable compensation to any independent compensation consultants or other external advisors retained by the Compensation Committee. During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged the independent compensation consultant for limited services such as LTIP measurement. In 2018, the Compensation Committee evaluated whether any work provided by its Compensation Committee consultant raised any conflict of interest and determined that it did not.
Risk Considerations
The Compensation Committee and the Board periodically review the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices. These assessments include an examination of the changes in our risk profile over the past year for our compensation policies and practices. Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee and the Board each determined that these risks were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Among other things, the Compensation Committee and the Board took into consideration the fact that:
Compensation Peer Group â 2018
The following is our peer group for executive compensation purposes. The companies in the executive compensation peer group were selected as they are of similar size as Gran Tierra, are in the same line of business, and are listed on a major exchange in Canada or the United States. As the Company's executive office is located in Canada, most of the companies in the peer group below were chosen as they are also located in Canada and would have similar pay structures. Although the Company monitors the salaries of the executives in its compensation peer group, there were no salary increases for the Company's NEOs in 2018.
The Company has a separate peer group for evaluating performance which is further explained on page 49.
Elements of Our Compensation Program
Our executive compensation program includes a mix of fixed and variable pay with performance periods ranging from one to five years. The primary elements are summarized in the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Long-term Incentive Variable  PSUs Stock options  3 years 5 years Reward medium and long-term performance 
Long-term Incentive Variable  PSUs Stock options  3 years 5 years Reward medium and long-term performance 
[END TABLE]
Base Salary
We pay base salaries in order to attract and retain talented executives and to provide our NEOs with a fixed base of cash compensation. The salaries typically reflect each NEO's experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities. Competitive market conditions also have an impact on setting salary levels. The salaries of our NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis by our Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to his own salary, which is reviewed and determined by the Compensation Committee). The table below sets forth the annual base salaries for our NEOs for fiscal 2018 which were unchanged from 2017.
Short Term Incentives â Cash Bonus
One of our key compensation objectives is for a significant portion of each NEO's compensation to be tied to Company performance. Our annual cash bonus plan provides opportunities for our executives, including the NEOs, to earn annual cash bonuses tied to the successful achievement of key operational, financial and market objectives that that drive our business and stockholder value.
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the annual bonus target for each of our NEOs which were calculated as a percentage of their respective base salaries.
The value of the bonus is calculated as below:
The following bonus structure was approved by the Compensation Committee for the following executives in connection with 2018 performance:
Assessment of Individual Performance
Individual performance has a significant impact on the annual cash bonus for NEOs other than the Chief Executive Officer and is weighted between 20% and 40% of the award with the remaining amount being driven by our performance relative to our corporate performance measures. The individual performance rating for each NEO, other than the Chief Executive Officer, is determined through a formal performance evaluation conducted with the Chief Executive Officer. The performance evaluation measures how each NEO performs against criteria directly related to their position.
2018 Corporate Performance Goals and Scores
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board of Directors approves the measures (and associated performance targets) that will be used to measure corporate performance for the fiscal year. For 2018, the Board of Directors approved eight goals based on the Company's budget and operating plan that were considered to be the key drivers to the success of the Company's business plan for the year, which were used as corporate performance metrics to determine the 2018 annual bonus structure (40% operational, 30% financial, 10% market and 20% strategic). Each of the measures had a threshold level of performance which had to be reached for the measure to contribute to a payout. There is a target level of performance for each element and a stretch level of performance above threshold. Between threshold and target performance, and between target and the stretch maximum, performance factors are graduated according to the performance level actually reached. The Board of Directors met in January 2019 to assess the Company's 2018 performance relative to the pre-established targets. The following table summarizes the results of the assessment:
Actual Annual Cash Bonuses Earned for 2018
The following table shows the 2018 annual cash bonus awards earned by each NEO:
Long-Term Equity Incentive Program
Our equity compensation program has been designed to incorporate equity awards that vest based on the achievement of key operational goals established by the Board of Directors as described below. Approximately 80% of the value of equity awards granted in 2018 consisted of PSUs and 20% of the value of equity awards consisted of stock options, based on the fair value at grant date.
2018 PSUs Granted
As part of our long-term incentive plan, PSUs are designed to create a link between executive compensation and increased stockholder value by rewarding NEOs for achievement against key performance metrics over a three-year period. Our goal is to further incentivize our executives to achieve the operational goals established by the Board and to increase share and net asset value for our stockholders.
Each PSU entitles the holder to be issued the number of common shares designated in the performance award multiplied by a payout multiplier, with such common shares (or cash equal in value to such shares) to be issued on dates determined by the Compensation Committee, but no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the last performance period applicable to the award ends. The payout multiplier is dependent on the performance of the Company relative to pre-defined corporate performance measures for the period. The number of PSUs that vest may range from zero to 200% of the target number granted based on the performance multiplier earned under the terms of the award agreement. Each recipient must also remain in the continuous service of Gran Tierra from the date of grant through the date of settlement in order for the award to vest. PSUs are granted annually.
The PSUs granted to our NEOs in 2018 may become fully vested at the end of the three-year performance period, based upon our performance with respect to four separate performance periods as follows:
The calculation of the performance multiplier is as follows:
Total Shareholder Return. The Compensation Committee believes that the comparison of Gran Tierra's TSR over a specified period of time to the returns of peer companies over the same period is an objective external measure of the Company's effectiveness in translating its results into stockholder returns. TSR is calculated by comparing Gran Tierra's change in share price plus reinvestment of dividends relative to the performance of a pre-selected peer group of companies with respect to the same measures. The framework included in the table below is used in determining our relative TSR. Results between the performance levels are interpolated on a linear basis.
The Compensation Committee approved the following total shareholder return performance peer group (the "Performance Peer Group") for the 2018 PSUs:
If any of the peer companies undergoes a change in corporate capitalization or a corporate transaction (including, but not limited to, a going-private transaction, bankruptcy, liquidation, merger or consolidation) during the performance period, the Compensation Committee will undertake an evaluation to determine whether such peer company will be replaced. The Committee has pre-approved Denbury Resources Inc. and EP Energy Corporation as replacement companies. During 2018 Spartan Energy Corp. was removed from the Performance Peer Group and Baytex Energy Corp. was added as a replacement.
The Performance Peer Group was developed with the assistance of our independent compensation consultants to meet at least one of the following specifications: an enterprise value of at least $1 billion; Proved Reserves of 30 million BOE; WI production before royalties of 20,000+ BOEPD; production to be at least 50% oil and natural gas liquids. Enterprise value was calculated as the market value of our common stock plus the market value of debt minus cash and investments.
Net Asset Value. NAV per share is calculated as before tax net present value discounted at 10% minus estimated net debt, divided by the number of shares of Gran Tierra's common stock issued and outstanding. Management uses NAV per share as a measure of the relative change of Gran Tierra's net asset value over its outstanding common stock over a period of time. NAV per share was chosen as a performance metric for our PSUs because it provides an indication of the value of the Company's reserves on a per share basis. Growth in NAV per share demonstrates the Company's ability to increase the underlying value of the Company without diluting stockholders. The framework included in the table below is used to assess NAV per share performance. Results between the performance levels are interpolated on a linear basis.
Strategy. Execution of strategy was chosen as a performance metric for our PSUs because it provides a link to the Company's success in meeting key milestones and achieving its strategic goals. The Strategic Goals included metrics set by the Compensation Committee relating to acquisitions, exploration discoveries, financing and exploration commitments included in the Company's annual budget and approved by the Board.
The following table lists the number of PSUs awarded in 2018 at minimum, target, and maximum levels:
2018 Performance Results. In January 2019, the Compensation Committee confirmed and approved the performance results for the portion of the 2018 annual PSU awards that vest based on performance during the one-year performance period ended December 31, 2018 and continued employment through the end of 2020.
For the performance period ended December 31, 2018, the performance results were as follows:
The PSUs granted in 2016 vested on December 31, 2018 and the calculation of the performance multiplier for the three-year period is as follows:
Stock Options
Stock options provide NEOs with an option to purchase Gran Tierra common shares at a future date at the exercise price determined at the time of grant.
Our Compensation Committee and Board continues to believe that time-vested stock options are an important element of our equity compensation program because they serve as a strong retention tool while ensuring that the recipient only receives value upon an increase in the value of our common stock. Stock options within the LTIP mix account for 20% of the value of equity awards granted.
Stock options vest pro-rata annually over three years, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant, and have a term of five years, subject to the officer's continuous provision of services to Gran Tierra through the vesting date (except as otherwise provided in an officer's award agreement or any employment agreement with Gran Tierra). The exercise price for our stock options is equal to the market price per share at the time of grant. The Compensation Committee meets in the first quarter each year to evaluate, review and approve the annual stock option award design and level of awards for the NEOs.
RSUs
No RSUs were granted to NEOs in 2018 as the program has been replaced with grants of PSUs for our executives. RSUs granted prior to 2018 entitle the holder to receive, either the underlying number of shares of our Common Stock upon vesting of such units or, at the option of the Company, a cash payment equal to the value of the underlying shares. RSUs vest over three years, and once an RSU is vested, it is immediately settled.
Equity Awards Granted During 2018
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following awards under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan for the NEOs:
Benefits
The NEOs are eligible for full participation in all rights and benefits under any life insurance, disability, medical, dental, health and accident plans maintained by Gran Tierra for its employees and executive officers. Our executive officers generally do not receive any supplemental retirement benefits or perquisites, except for corporate health services and other limited perquisites provided on a case-by-case basis. In addition, our employees including our executive officers will be paid 100% of their base salary in the event they become disabled while still employed by us, until such time as the executive officer begins to receive long-term disability insurance benefits which is intended to pay two-thirds of base salary to a maximum of $15,000/month to age 70. These are standard basic benefits in our industry and help to retain and recruit key talent.
Share Ownership Guidelines
We have implemented share ownership guidelines for all of our executives, which are designed to align their long-term financial interests with those of our stockholders. The NEO share ownership guidelines are as follows:
If at any time an executive officer does not meet their ownership requirement, they must retain (a) any of our Common Stock owned by them (whether owned directly or indirectly) and (b) any net shares received as the result of the exercise, vesting or payment of any equity award until the ownership requirement is met, in each case unless otherwise approved by the Compensation Committee. For this purpose, "net shares" means the shares of stock that remain after shares are sold or withheld to (i) pay the exercise price for a stock option award or (ii) satisfy any tax obligations, including withholding taxes, arising in connection with the exercise, vesting or payment of an equity award.
Compliance with these requirements is evaluated as of December 31 of each year. The value of an individual's share ownership as of such date is determined by multiplying the number of shares of our stock or other eligible equity interests held by the individual by the greater of the purchase price of the stock or the closing price on December 31 of each year.
In determining stock ownership levels, we include shares of common stock held directly or indirectly by the officer (including shares beneficially owned in a trust, by a limited liability company or partnership, and by a spouse and/or minor children). Outstanding RSUs, PSUs and unexercised stock options are not included. If an executive officer does not satisfy the stock ownership requirements, they must retain all shares acquired on the vesting of equity awards or the exercise of stock options (net of exercise costs and taxes) until compliance is achieved.
The following table shows the number and value of shares owned at December 31, 2018 compared with the minimum share ownership guideline:
Clawback Provisions
The Company has adopted a policy specifying that if an executive engages in fraud or intentional misconduct that requires a material restatement of financial results, and the fraud or intentional misconduct results in an incorrect determination that an incentive compensation performance goal had been achieved, the Board may take action to recover any incentive compensation resulting from the incorrect determination that had been paid to the executive during the three-year period preceding the filing of the accounting restatement.
Prohibition on Speculative Trading of Company Stock
We maintain a policy for securities transactions applicable to all officers, directors, and other members of management of the Company which prohibits engaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to our stock at any time. In addition, our Insider Trading Policy, among other things, prohibits our officers, including our NEOs, directors and employees from trading during quarterly and special blackout periods.
Employment Agreements
The Compensation Committee approves the terms of all NEO employment agreements. The terms of those agreements were structured to attract and retain persons key to our success, as well as to be competitive with compensation practices for executives in similar positions at companies of similar size and complexity. In assessing whether the terms of the employment agreements were competitive, the Compensation Committee received advice from our independent compensation consultant and reviewed appropriate surveys and industry benchmarking data. The employment agreements do not have a fixed term. No changes were made to any of the NEO employment agreements during 2018. The terms of the NEO employment agreements provide for certain payments and benefits in connection with a termination of employment and corporate transaction. The Compensation Committee believes these payments allow management to focus their attention and energy on making objective business decisions that are in the best interests of stockholders without allowing personal considerations to affect the decision-making process. Additionally, executive officers at other companies in our industry and the general market in which we compete for executive talent commonly provide post-termination payments, and we have consistently provided this benefit to certain executives in order to remain competitive in attracting and retaining skilled professionals in our industry. In 2017, the Company's pay practices were amended so that no new employment agreements entered into between Gran Tierra and executive officers will include any provisions that provide for excise tax gross-ups or change in control "Single" or "Modified Single" triggers of severance payments or equity vesting accelerations. The Company did not enter into any new employment agreements with executive officers during 2018.
Say on Pay Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
The Company asked stockholders to vote on a "say-on-pay" advisory vote on our executive compensation in 2018 at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Stockholders expressed substantial support for the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 94% of the votes cast in favor of the "say-on-pay" advisory vote. The Compensation Committee also considers many other factors in evaluating our executive compensation programs as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the Compensation Committee's assessment of the interaction of our compensation programs with our corporate business objectives and review of peer group data, each of which is evaluated in the context of the Compensation Committee's duty to act in the best interests of our stockholders. While these factors were considered by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to our executive compensation program and policies in 2018.
Report of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company's disclosure under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" contained in this proxy statement. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

The following table shows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, certain information regarding outstanding equity awards held by each of the NEOs.
2018 OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED
The following table presents information concerning the aggregate number of options that were exercised and RSUs that vested during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for the NEOs.
POTENTIAL PAYMENT UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL
Mr. Coral
In connection with Mr. Coral's resignation from employment on July 18, 2018, we entered into a Transaction Agreement providing for a lump sum cash payment of $600,000, excluding vacation pay.
Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans and West
In the event that Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans or West die, voluntarily resign (without good reason, as defined below), or their employment is terminated by Gran Tierra for cause (as defined below), the executive will not be entitled to receive any further compensation or benefits whatsoever other than those which have accrued up to the executive's last day of active service.
The NEOs are entitled to severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination of employment by Gran Tierra other than for cause or a termination of employment by the NEO for good reason, as follows:
In addition, if Mr. Guidry is required to file a U.S. income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, and if any of the payments or benefits received or to be received by him constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), the Company shall pay to Mr. Guidry, no later than the time such Excise Tax is required to be paid by the Executive or withheld by the Company, an additional amount equal to the sum of the Excise Tax payable by Mr. Guidry, plus the amount necessary to put him in the same after-tax position as if no Excise Tax had been imposed. The Company believes that to ensure Gran Tierra's executive compensation remains competitive, the Chief Executive Officer should be tax equalized to his Canadian citizen colleagues on payments that are subject to U.S. Excise Tax. In 2018, this amount would have been $1,476,428, calculated as follows:
Pursuant to the employment agreements for each of Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans and West, "cause" means any act or omission of the executive which would, at common law, permit an employer to terminate the employment of an employee without notice or payment in lieu of notice.
As defined in the employment agreements for each of Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans and West, "good reason" generally means any of the following without the executive's express written consent:
The following events will generally constitute a "change in control" pursuant to the employment agreements with each of Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans and West:
Upon a termination of employment, each of Messrs. Guidry, Ellson, Caldwell, Evans and West forfeit any unvested RSUs and stock options.
ESTIMATED POTENTIAL PAYMENTS
The table below estimates the amounts payable if an involuntary termination of employment without cause, a termination for good reason or a specified corporate transaction had occurred on December 31, 2018, for the NEOs using $2.17, the closing price of the stock on that date.
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
In determining the median employee, we prepared a list of all employees as of December 31, 2018. Consistent with applicable rules, we used reasonable estimates both in the methodology used to identify the median employee and in calculating the annual total compensation for employees other than the chief executive officer. In measuring our employees' total compensation, for employees other than the Chief Executive Officer, we used their base salary paid in 2018, their annual cash bonus paid in 2018 and the value of the equity awards they received in 2018. Total compensation for Gary S. Guidry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer was determined to be $1,601,554 and was approximately 22 times the median annual compensation of all Company employees excluding the Chief Executive Officer of $72,092. For purposes of this calculation, the Company had 333 employees in Canada and Colombia, excluding the Chief Executive Officer.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Related Person Transactions Policy And Procedures
Gran Tierra discourages transactions with related persons. The charter of the Audit Committee provides that the Audit Committee is charged with reviewing and recommending to the Board the approval or disapproval of any related person transactions, as defined under Regulation S-K, Item 404. This policy covers, with certain exceptions set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which Gran Tierra was or is to be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. In addition, potential related persons transactions are to be referred to the Chief Executive Officer, and brought to the attention of the full Board if material.
There have been no related party transactions since January 1, 2018 where the procedures described above did not require review, approval or ratification or where these procedures were not followed.
Certain Related-Person Transactions
Gran Tierra has entered into indemnity agreements with certain officers and directors which provide, among other things, that Gran Tierra will indemnify such officer or director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he may be required to pay in actions or proceedings which he or she is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer or other agent of Gran Tierra, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and Gran Tierra's Bylaws.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials and for presentation at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders may do so by following the procedures set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and must submit their proposals to us at our principal executive offices (to the Corporate Secretary at 900, 520 - 3rd Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R3), not later than the close of business on November 27, 2019. If the date of the 2020 annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the 2019 annual meeting, the deadline for submitting proposals is a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail the proxy materials for our 2020 annual meeting. There is no minimum number of shares required to be held by a stockholder interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials.
Our Bylaws provide that stockholders may nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors or bring any other business before the stockholders (other than matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8) at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders only by sending to our Corporate Secretary a notice containing the information required by our Bylaws. Notice to us must be made not less than 30 or more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that if the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made by Gran Tierra, notice may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by Gran Tierra. Detailed information about how to make stockholder proposals or nominations for our annual meetings of stockholders can be found in our Bylaws.
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other annual meeting materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other annual meeting materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are stockholders of Gran Tierra will be "householding" Gran Tierra's proxy materials. A single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or a single set of annual meeting materials will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or a separate set of annual meeting materials, please notify your broker. You can also request prompt delivery of a copy of the proxy statement and annual report by contacting Gran Tierra Energy Inc., Diane Phillips, Corporate Secretary, 900, 520 â 3 Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 0R3 or by telephone at (403) 265-3221. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or multiple sets of annual meeting materials at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their brokers
OTHER MATTERS
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ADVISORY
This document contains opinions, forecasts, projections, guidance, plans and other statements about future events or results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and financial outlook and forward looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (collectively, "forward-looking statements"). Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company's expectation to fully fund its operations from cash from operating activities, expectations regarding the annual meeting and the related procedures, the filing of voting results, the Company's future operations including planned operations and the exploration and development of the Company's blocks, areas and fields.
The forward-looking statements contained in this document reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of Gran Tierra including, without limitation, that Gran Tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations, the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data, pricing and cost estimates (including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates), rig availability, the effects of drilling down-dip, the effects of waterflood and high pressure stimulation operations, the extent and effect of delivery disruptions, and the general continuance of current or, where applicable, assumed operational, regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion, and the ability of Gran Tierra to access capital and other resources and to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned. Gran Tierra believes the material factors, expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors, expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements in this document are: Gran Tierra's operations are located in Colombia, and unexpected problems can arise due to guerrilla activity; technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production, transport or sale of the Company's products, including instability of electricity supply at our production facilities; geographic, political and weather conditions can impact the production, transport or sale of the Company's products; the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than Gran Tierra currently predicts; the ability of Gran Tierra to execute its business plan and its drilling and development plan; the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur; the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for the Company's operating activities; the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells; unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel; the risk that oil prices could remain weak or further decline, or global economic and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than Gran Tierra currently predicts, which could cause Gran Tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program; and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Gran Tierra's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, under the caption "Risk Factors" in Gran Tierra's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 27, 2019. These filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission website at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although the current guidance, capital spending program and long term strategy of Gran Tierra is based upon the current expectations of the management of Gran Tierra, should any one of a number of issues arise, Gran Tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and/ or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this document as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact Gran Tierra's results of operations and financing position.
Statements relating to "reserves" and "resources" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, including that the reserves and resources described can be profitably produced in the future.
All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this document and the fact that this document remains available does not constitute a representation by Gran Tierra that Gran Tierra believes these forward-looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date. Actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward-looking statements. Gran Tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable securities laws. Gran Tierra's forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
DISCLOSURE OF OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
Gran Tierra's Statement of Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information on Form 51-101F1 dated effective as at December 31, 2018 (the "GTE 51-101F1"), which includes disclosure of its oil and gas reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 â Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities ("NI 51-101") and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook ("COGEH") forming the basis of this document, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Estimates of net present value contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value of reserves or resources. Estimates of reserves or resources and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation.
Gas volumes are converted to BOE at the rate of 6 Mcf of gas per bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. The rate is not necessarily indicative of the relationship between oil and gas prices. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. In addition, given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one, utilizing a BOE conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value.
Definitions
All dollar ($) amounts referred to in this proxy statement are United States (U.S) dollars, unless otherwise indicated.
BOE means barrels of oil equivalent.
BOEPD means barrels of oil equivalent per day.
MMBOE means million barrels of oil equivalent
Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves.
Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.
Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Probable reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of Proved plus Probable plus Possible reserves. The estimate of reserves for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves for all properties, due to the effects of aggregation.
See the GTE 51-101F1 for additional definitions regarding terms used in this document.
Oil and Gas Metrics
This document contains a number of oil and gas metrics, including free cash flow, NAV per share, operating netback, cash netback and reserves per share which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods.
Prospective Resources
Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective Resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. Not all exploration projects will result in discoveries. The chance that an exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to as the "chance of discovery." Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation the chance of commerciality is the product of two risk componentsâthe chance of discovery and the chance of development. There is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.
Estimates of the Company's Prospective Resources are based upon the GTE McDaniel Prospective Resources Report. The estimates of Prospective Resources provided in this document are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated Prospective Resources will be recovered. Actual resources may be greater than or less than the estimates provided in this in this document and the differences may be material. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by McDaniel in evaluating Gran Tierra's Prospective Resources will be attained and variances could be material. There is no certainty that any portion of the Prospective Resources will be discovered. If discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the Prospective Resources.
Estimates of Prospective Resources are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery. Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially. In addition, we have made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all of the drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities.
The prospective resources in this document are classified as "mean" representing the arithmetic average of the expected recoverable volume. It is the most accurate single point representation of the volume distribution.
For a discussion of Gran Tierra's interest in the Prospective Resources, the location of the Prospective Resources, the product type reasonably expected, the risks and level of uncertainty associated with recovery of the resources, the significant positive and negative factors relevant to the estimate of the Prospective Resources, a description of the applicable projects maturity sub-categories and other relevant information regarding the Prospective Resources estimates, please see the GTE NI 51-101F1 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
