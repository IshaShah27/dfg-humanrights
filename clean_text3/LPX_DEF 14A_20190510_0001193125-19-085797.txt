PROXY STATEMENT 
Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("LP"), is soliciting proxies on behalf of its Board of Directors to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (including any postponement or adjournment of the meeting). This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are first being distributed to stockholders beginning on March 26, 2019. 
PROXY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of LP will be held at LP's Corporate Headquarters, 414 Union Street, Suite 2000, Nashville, Tennessee, 37219 on Friday, May 10, 2019, at 7:30 a.m. local time. At the time this proxy statement was printed, management knew of only the following four items of business to be presented at the annual meeting, as listed in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Item 1—Election of Directors Embree, Gottung and McCoy 
The LP Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each of the three nominees, Ms. Embree, Ms. Gottung and Mr. McCoy, all of whom are current members of the Board. Ms. Embree is an independent director and serves as a member of the Finance and Audit Committee and Environmental, Quality and Compliance Committee. Ms. Gottung is an independent director and serves as a member of the Compensation Committee and Environmental, Quality and Compliance Committee. Mr. McCoy is an independent director and serves as a member of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Item 2—Ratification of the selection of Independent Auditor Deloitte & Touche LLP for 2019 
The LP Board recommends a vote "FOR" the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as LP's outside independent auditor to audit its consolidated financial statements for 2019. The Board has determined it to be sound corporate governance practice to submit the appointment for ratification by LP's stockholders even though it is not required. 
Item 3—Approval, on an advisory basis, of named executive officer compensation 
The LP Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of 2018 named executive officer compensation. We provide our stockholders an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, although that vote is non-binding. We believe that our executive compensation programs must attract, retain and motivate our management team to lead our company to sustainable financial performance that furthers the long-term interests of LP and its stockholders. Stockholders approved the 2017 named executive officer compensation at the 2018 Annual Stockholders meeting by a favorable vote of 92 percent of the votes cast. 
Item 4—Approval of the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
The LP Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). The ESPP enables eligible employees of LP and certain of its subsidiaries and/or parents to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of Common Stock and thereby enhance the sense of ownership of the Company. Our Board of Directors believes that providing eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in the Company has been, and will continue to be, essential to LP's ability to attract and retain the highest quality and highest performing employees. Our Board also believes that the ownership of shares of Common Stock by our employees motivates our employees to contribute to the achievement of our corporate objectives and our success. 
VOTING PROCEDURE 
As allowed by rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are providing access to this proxy statement by Internet. You will not receive a paper copy of this proxy statement by   mail unless you request it. Instead, you were sent a notice (the "Notice") providing instructions on how to view this proxy statement and vote your proxy by Internet. 
If you requested a paper copy of this proxy statement, a proxy card is enclosed for your use. To vote by mail, please sign, date, and return the proxy card promptly. For your convenience, a return envelope is enclosed, which requires no postage if mailed in the United States. You may indicate your voting instructions on the proxy card in the spaces provided. Properly completed proxies will be voted as instructed. If you return a proxy without indicating voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors for the directors nominated in Item 1 and for Item 2, Item 3 and Item 4 listed in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
If you vote your proxy prior to the meeting, you may revoke it (1) by filing either a written notice of revocation or a properly signed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of LP at any time before the meeting, (2) by voting in person at the annual meeting, or (3) by following the instructions in the Notice. 
If shares are held for your account in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan administered by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., all your shares held in the plan will be voted in the same manner as shares you vote by proxy. If you do not vote by proxy, the shares held for your account in the plan will not be voted. 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019, are entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and to vote at the meeting. At the record date, there were 123,435,389 shares of common stock, $1 par value ("Common Stock"), outstanding. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be acted upon. A majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock represented at the meeting will constitute a quorum. Additional information concerning holders of outstanding Common Stock may be found under the heading "Holders of Common Stock" below. 
The Board of Directors has adopted a confidential voting policy which provides that the voting instructions of stockholders are not to be disclosed to LP except (a) in the case of communications intended for management, (b) in the event of certain contested matters or (c) as required by law. Votes will be tabulated by independent tabulators and summaries of the tabulation will be provided to management. 
Banks and brokers acting as nominees for beneficial owners are not permitted to vote proxies with regard to Items 1, 3 and 4 on behalf of beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions to the nominee (a "broker non-vote"), making it especially important that, if you hold your shares in "street name," you send your broker your voting instructions.

The Board believes that Mr. McCoy's broad understanding of the operational, financial and strategic issues facing large global companies, his leadership and oversight in LP's compliance matters, his leadership roles for companies producing both commodity and specialty products, and his valuable strategic advice to the Board and management in advancing LP's interests make him particularly well-suited to serve as a director of LP.

Your shares represented by a properly completed and returned proxy card will be voted FOR the election of the three nominees named above unless you specify otherwise (Item 1 on the proxy card). If any nominee becomes unavailable to serve (which is not anticipated), your proxy will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors. Each nominee who receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on his or her election will be elected, meaning that the number of shares voted for a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast against that director's election. Shares not voted on the election of a nominee, whether because of an abstention, the record holder fails to return a proxy, or a broker non-vote occurs, will not count in determining the total number of votes cast on his or her election.

The current members of the Board of Directors whose terms of office will continue beyond the 2019 annual meeting are listed below. The Board of Directors has determined that each continuing director named below, other than Mr. Southern, has no material relationship with LP, either directly, or as a partner, stockholder, officer   or director of an organization that has a relationship with LP, and is independent under the NYSE's listing standards and LP's Bylaws.

• An independent director serves as Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board has been designated to preside at Board meetings and executive  sessions so long as he or she is an independent director. In the Chairman's absence, the Board would designate another independent director to preside at these meetings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of the directors and all members of the Finance and Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees must be  independent. To be considered independent under LP's corporate governance principles, a director must meet applicable standards imposed by the SEC and the NYSE, as well as additional requirements. The additional requirements are that the  director: (1) is free of any relationship that may interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a director and (2) has not been an officer or employee of LP (including its subsidiaries or affiliates) at any time in the  past five years. The Board has determined that each current director other than Mr. Southern is independent under these standards. LP's independence standards are available on its website together with the rest of the corporate governance  standards, as summarized below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independent directors meet in executive session without management present in connection with each quarterly Board meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Following any material change in employment or business association, a director must tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Board,  which may choose not to accept it.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors must retire as of the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders after attaining age 75.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors are provided with orientation and continuing education opportunities relating to performance of their duties as directors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The composition, structure, purpose, responsibilities and duties of each of the standing Board committees other than the Executive Committee are set  forth in written charters approved from time to time by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board and each of the Board committees have authority to engage outside advisers, including an independent compensation consultant and outside  legal counsel, who are independent of management to provide expert or legal advice to the directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees annual evaluations of the operations and effectiveness of the Board and its committees, and  communicates the results of these evaluations to the full Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each director must receive a majority of the stockholder votes cast in uncontested elections of directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LP has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all directors, officers, and employees and a separate Code of Ethics for Senior  Financial Officers, including the CEO, which relates to conflicts of interest and full, fair and accurate financial reporting. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics addresses, among other matters, conflicts of interest, corporate opportunities,  confidentiality, fair dealing, protection and proper use of company assets, legal and regulatory compliance, and reporting of illegal or unethical behavior. Waivers of either code with respect to directors and executive officers may be made only by  the Board or a Board committee to which this responsibility is delegated, and will be promptly disclosed to LP's stockholders by posting on LP's website at www.lpcorp.com. In 2018, there were no waiver requests.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LP's CEO is responsible for maintaining a succession-planning process with respect to top management positions and to report to the Board at least  annually regarding specific assessments and recommendations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for both directors and executive officers. The guidelines specify target amounts of share ownership.  Each outside director is expected to acquire and hold a number of shares equal in value to five times the regular annual cash retainer for directors within five years of joining the Board. For 2018, all of the directors met the guidelines with the  exception of Ms. Embree, Mr. Horton and Mr. Macadam. The guidelines for executive officers are discussed under the heading "Additional Policies and Guidelines Affecting Executive Compensation."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LP's Insider Trading Policy prohibits LP's directors, executive officers, senior management and certain other key managers from engaging in  hedging or speculative transactions involving LP Common Stock, including buying or selling put or call options or entering into forward sale contracts.  
[END TABLE]
Current copies of LP's Corporate Governance Principles, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers are available on LP's website at www.lpcorp.com by clicking on "About Us," then "Investor Relations," then "Corporate Governance." Any amendments to either code will also be posted at www.lpcorp.com. Copies of any of these documents may also be obtained free of charge by writing to Corporate Affairs, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, 414 Union Street, Suite 2000, Nashville, Tennessee 37219. 
The Board Leadership Structure 
The members of the Board have a diverse set of skills and experiences and all of the members, except our CEO, are independent. The Board maintains a separate Chairman position to enhance the Board's independence and effectiveness. The Board has full access to the experience and insight of the CEO, as he is a member of the Board. 
The Chairman's duties include: preparing agendas for Board meetings in consultation with other directors and management; chairing meetings of the Board and executive sessions of the independent directors; chairing meetings of the Executive Committee; leading the independent directors in periodic reviews of the performance of the CEO; keeping directors informed by timely distribution of information; serving as liaison between independent directors and the CEO; and recommending independent outside advisors who report directly to the Board on material issues. 
Oversight of Risk 
The directors are elected representatives of the stockholders and act as fiduciaries on their behalf. In performing its general oversight function, the Board reviews and assesses LP's strategic and business planning as well as management's approach to addressing significant risks. All committees report directly to the Board regularly, and all committee minutes are distributed for review by the entire Board. Additionally, the Board and committees are authorized to retain independent advisers, including attorneys or other consultants, to assist in their oversight activities. 
As set out in LP's Corporate Governance Principles, it is the responsibility of the CEO, and of executive management under the CEO's direction, to operate the business of LP on a day-to-day basis in a competent and   ethical manner to produce value for the stockholders, and to regularly inform the Board of the status of LP's business operations. Management's responsibilities include strategic planning, preparation of annual operating plans and budgets, risk management and financial reporting. The Board fulfills its oversight responsibilities as set out in the Corporate Governance Principles on behalf of the stockholders and in furtherance of LP's long-term health. The Board's role does not involve managing the daily complexities of business transactions. The current leadership structure provides directors with significant information related to risks faced by LP, as well as an opportunity to synthesize, discuss and consider these risks independent of management and to provide guidance to management. 
As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Board and its committees are involved in the oversight of risk management of LP. It does so in part through its review of findings and recommendations by LP's Risk Management Council, the participants of which are executives and/or functional department leaders in the areas of Risk Management, Finance, Internal Audit, Legal and Compliance, Information Technology (including cyber-security), Environmental, and Product Quality, all of whom supervise day-to-day risk management throughout LP. The purpose of the Risk Management Council is to help the CEO assess the effectiveness of LP's identification and handling of risks. The Board or its committees have direct access to financial and compliance leaders on a quarterly basis or more frequently if requested. Further, the Board is provided a comprehensive report as to the Council's risk mapping efforts, as well as management's efforts to mitigate and transfer risk. 
The Board committees consider the risks within their areas of responsibilities under each of their charters. The Finance and Audit Committee considers operational risks, cyber-security risks, and financial risk on a quarterly basis and reviews various guidelines for cash, credit and liquidity measures. It also reviews risks related to financial disclosures and reporting and reviews the audit risk assessment identifying internal controls and risks that affect the audit plan for the coming year. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the various regulatory changes and trends related to corporate governance, including Board member selection and maintaining appropriate corporate governance principles and guidelines, as well as overseeing annual evaluations to assess Board and committee effectiveness. The Environmental Quality and Compliance Committee reviews quarterly compliance reports from Quality, Internal Audit, Legal Compliance and Environmental, and considers the various allegations made through the anonymous hotline, reviews training statistics, and annually reviews the entire ethics program and any waivers of the program. The Compensation Committee reviews LP's overall compensation programs and their effectiveness at linking executive pay to long-term performance, as well as aligning the interests of management with stockholders. Each director is informed of the oversight activities of each committee through regular reports by the Committee Chairs to the entire Board as well as reviewing the minutes of each committee meeting. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
During 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served during his or her tenure on the Board or such committees. The Board of Directors held seven meetings in 2018. While LP does not have a policy regarding attendance by directors at the annual meeting of stockholders, in 2018, all directors serving on the Board at that time attended the annual meeting of stockholders. 
The Board's committees and membership on each committee as of March 11, 2019 are set forth in the table below. Each committee shown below other than the Executive Committee has a written charter delineating its membership, duties and functions. Copies of the charters are available on LP's website as described above under "Principles of Corporate Governance" and may also be obtained by writing to the address listed above.

Finance and Audit Committee 
The Finance and Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company, including the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory reporting requirements, and such other duties as directed by the Board of Directors. The committee has sole authority for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the Company's independent auditors, including the approval of any significant non-audit relationship. 
The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of the listing requirements of the NYSE. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Landgraf and Mr. Macadam are audit committee financial experts (as such term is defined under applicable rules of the SEC). 
The Finance and Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of Company risks related to accounting matters, financial reporting and legal and regulatory compliance. To satisfy these oversight responsibilities, the committee separately meets regularly with the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Director of Internal Audit, Deloitte & Touche LLP and other members of management, as needed. The committee also receives regular reports regarding issues such as the status and findings of audits being conducted by the internal and independent auditors, the status of material litigation, significant accounting events, accounting changes that could affect the Company's financial statements and proposed audit adjustments. Additionally, because of the importance of the integrity of our information technology systems to our financial reporting, the committee also reviews the Company's information technology platform and processes as well as strategies to prevent, detect and mitigate any cybersecurity threat. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight relating to the compensation of the executive officers of LP. The committee reviews and approves the strategy and design of the Company's compensation and benefits plans. The committee also makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for incentive compensation and equity-based compensation plans. The committee specifically reviews and makes recommendations regarding the compensation of the Company's chief executive officer and reviews and approves salaries and incentive compensation of other executive officers. The committee administers the Company's equity and cash incentive compensation plans. Additionally, the committee selects and regularly reviews the peer group used for benchmarking compensation for executive officers.  The committee is responsible for oversight of risks relating to employment policies and the Company's compensation and benefits systems and annually reviewing these policies and practices to determine whether they are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
To assist it in satisfying these oversight responsibilities, the committee has retained an independent compensation consultant and meets regularly with management to understand the financial, human resources and shareholder implications of compensation decisions being made. The committee chair also regularly meets between formal committee meetings with management and the committee's independent consultant. 
The board of directors has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is independent within the meaning of the listing requirements of the NYSE. 
Environmental, Quality and Compliance Committee 
The Environmental, Quality and Compliance Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of LP's environmental management systems and ethics and compliance programs, product quality management systems, other legal compliance programs, and non-financial compliance audit work performed by LP's internal audit group. The committee receives quarterly written reports directly from functional leaders responsible for compliance, including LP's Senior Vice President of Manufacturing Services, the Director of Internal Audit and the Director of Compliance. Additionally, these leaders report in person annually to the committee on a rotating basis and are generally available for other committee meetings, as needed. The Director of Compliance is a regular participant in committee meetings. The committee conducts an annual self-evaluation of its performance and satisfaction of its responsibilities under its charter and reports its findings to the Board. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is authorized to establish procedures for selecting and evaluating potential nominees for director and to recommend to the Board of Directors qualifications for membership on the Board, including standards of independence for outside directors. The committee also considers and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the size and diversity of the Board of Directors and Board committees, the selection of candidates for director, and the compensation of directors, including annual retainers, meeting fees, deferred compensation, stock and option grants, and pension or retirement plans. It develops and recommends for consideration by the Board principles, guidelines, and procedures for other matters of corporate governance that may arise. The committee is made up of independent Directors. The committee periodically reviews LP's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which covers directors, officers and employees and addresses conflicts of interest, reporting of illegal or unethical behavior and related issues, and makes any recommendations to the Board for changes as it deems appropriate. It also oversees annual evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, the operations of Board committees (including itself), and the contributions of individual directors. 
Compensation for outside directors is described below under "Directors' Compensation." The committee may request advice from FW Cook, its independent compensation consultant, regarding the types and amount of compensation provided to LP's outside directors. 
CONSIDERATION OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
LP's corporate governance principles approved by the Nominating Committee and adopted by the Board provide that directors must be persons of integrity, with significant accomplishments and recognized business stature, who will bring a diversity of perspectives to the Board. Although the Board has not adopted a specific policy with regard to considering diversity in identifying director nominees, it believes that appropriate expertise, gender, cultural and geographical diversity should be reflected on the Board. Directors must also be able to commit the necessary time to prepare for and attend all regularly scheduled meetings of the Board and committees on which they serve, except when there are unavoidable business or personal conflicts. The Nominating Committee uses the results of annual evaluations of the Board and Board committees in evaluating the skills and attributes desired in new director candidates. The Nominating Committee believes it to be desirable for all new outside directors (as is true of all current outside directors) to qualify as independent under the NYSE's listing standards. Experience in some capacity with publicly traded companies is also a desirable attribute. Additionally, the corporate governance   principles recognize that LP's CEO will normally be a director and that other senior officers may be elected to the Board in appropriate circumstances as long as a majority of directors are independent as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the NYSE's listing standards. The Nominating Committee is authorized by its charter to retain a third-party search firm to assist in identifying director candidates. 
As part of its annual self-assessment process, the Board and its committees determine the specific skill sets and necessary characteristics for an effective committee and the Board as a whole. If the Board, generally through the Nominating Committee, determines that a necessary skill set or perspective is absent, the Board will authorize an increase in the number of Board members. In the event of a vacancy resulting from retirement or this annual self-assessment process, the Nominating Committee determines which skills should be sought in filling the vacancy and then each current director is asked to suggest names of potential director candidates based on the applicable criteria. As part of the process, the Nominating Committee considers a potential candidate's ability to contribute to the diversity of personal and professional experiences, opinions, perspectives and backgrounds on the Board. Once the potential candidates are identified, the Nominating Committee designates one or more directors to screen each potential candidate for further consideration based on the relevant criteria. Following that screening process, the Nominating Committee (or a subcommittee) conducts in-person or telephone interviews with candidates warranting further consideration. Following those interviews, the Nominating Committee recommends a candidate to the full Board for election, as well as alternative candidates whom the Board may wish to consider. The Nominating Committee will consider stockholders' recommendations concerning nominees for director. Any such recommendation, including the name and qualifications of a nominee, may be submitted to LP at its corporate offices: Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, 414 Union Street, Suite 2000, Nashville, Tennessee 37219, to the attention of the Chairman of the Nominating Committee. Stockholder-recommended candidates will be evaluated using the same criteria described above. 
STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS FOR ELECTION AS DIRECTOR 
LP's Bylaws provide that nominations for election to the Board of Directors may be made by the Board or by any stockholder of record entitled to vote for the election of directors. Notice of a stockholder's intent to make such a nomination must be given in writing, by personal delivery or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the Chairman of the Nominating Committee, and must include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name and address of the stockholder and each proposed nominee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A representation that the stockholder is a record holder of Common Stock and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the  person or persons specified in the notice;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A description of any arrangements or understandings pursuant to which the nominations are to be made;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The signed consent of each proposed nominee to serve as a director if elected; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Such other information regarding each nominee as would be required to be included in LP's proxy statement if the person had been nominated by the  Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
The notice must be delivered at least 45 days prior to the first anniversary of the initial mailing date of LP's proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting. For the 2020 annual meeting, this notice must be received by LP no later than February 7, 2020. 
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE BOARD AND STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES OR OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES 
LP will promptly forward to the Chairman of the Board any letter or other written communication sent to the Board or any individual director or group of directors, as long as the communication is delivered by certified mail or courier service addressed to LP's Corporate Secretary at its corporate offices: Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, 414 Union Street, Suite 2000, Nashville, Tennessee 37219, and contains the name and address of the sender. If the communication is addressed to an individual director, it will first be sent to that individual for a determination as to whether it relates to a personal matter rather than an LP or an LP Board matter. The Chairman of the Board, in his or her sole discretion, will determine how to handle each communication, including forwarding it for consideration by the full Board, the non-management directors or independent directors only, a Board committee, or an individual director.  ITEM 2—RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
The Finance and Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as LP's outside independent auditor to, among other services, audit its consolidated financial statements for 2019. Although LP is not required to seek stockholder approval of this appointment, the Board has determined it to be sound corporate governance practice to submit the appointment for ratification by LP's stockholders. If the appointment is not ratified by stockholders, the Audit Committee will investigate the possible basis for the negative vote and will reconsider the appointment in light of the results of its investigation. 
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to attend the annual meeting where they will be available to respond to questions and, if they desire, may make a statement. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor 
The Finance and Audit Committee has pre-approved all audit services provided by LP's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The committee also pre-approved all audit-related and permissible non-audit services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP during 2018 and 2017 and concluded that the provision of those services was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. 
The Finance and Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of services provided by the independent auditor. Under the policy, pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year. Each pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific budget. In addition, the committee may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis. For each proposed service, the independent auditor must provide a statement that such service is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. Such a member must report any decisions to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Unless specified otherwise by the committee, the Chairman of the Finance and Audit Committee has been delegated pre-approval authority under the pre-approval policy. 
The aggregate fees, including expenses, billed to LP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by LP's principal accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 2,322,800      $ 2,329,500   
 Audit-Related Fees      45,195        31,800   
 Total Audit and Audit-Related Fees      2,367,995        2,361,300

 All Other Fees      1,800        1,500   
 Total Fees    $ 2,399,795      $ 2,392,800   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees.  Includes fees for audit services involving the audit of LP's consolidated financial statements, review of interim quarterly statements, the audit of LP's internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, any other procedures required to be performed by LP's independent auditor in order to render its opinion on LP's consolidated financial statements, and services in connection with statutory audits and financial audits for certain of LP's subsidiaries. 
Audit-Related Fees.  Includes any fees for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor and are not reported as audit fees. These audit-related services may include due diligence services pertaining to potential business acquisitions or dispositions, due diligence procedures related to debt or equity offerings, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial reporting, or disclosure matters not classified as audit services, assistance with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting guidance from rulemaking authorities not classified as audit services, financial audits of employee   benefit plans, and assistance with internal control reporting requirements. Audit-related fees for 2018 and 2017 primarily included fees for audits of employee benefit plans in Canada and services related to environmental agreed upon procedures. 
Tax Fees.  Includes any fees for tax services, including tax compliance and planning services. Tax fees for 2018 and 2017 primarily include fees for consultation on value added tax and other tax returns in various non-US tax jurisdiction. 
All Other Fees.  Amounts represent fees for a license to use a financial accounting technical research database. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as LP's independent auditor for 2019 (Item 2 on the proxy card). 
FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
In discharging its responsibilities, the Audit Committee and its individual members have met with management and LP's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, to review LP's accounting functions and the audit process and to review and discuss LP's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with its outside auditing firm all matters that the firm was required to communicate and discuss with the Audit Committee under applicable auditing standards and all other legal, regulatory and corporate governance standards, including those described in Auditing Standard 1301, as amended, regarding communications with audit committees. Deloitte & Touche LLP has also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the firm's independence. 
Based on its review and discussions with management and LP's outside auditor, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that LP's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, be included in LP's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Kurt M. Landgraf, Chairman

Stephen E. Macadam  ITEM 3—APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
The Board of Directors recognizes the interest of stockholders in executive compensation matters. As required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), we are providing our stockholders an opportunity to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement. Although the vote is non-binding, we value continued and constructive feedback from our stockholders on compensation and other important matters. In 2018, stockholders approved the compensation policies by a favorable vote of 92% of the votes cast. 
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis "CD&A" section of this proxy statement, we believe that our compensation packages provide competitive compensation that enables us to attract, retain and motivate a high-performance executive management team, link executive performance to corporate financial performance, and align the interests of management and stockholders by promoting ownership of LP Common Stock. For more details on our compensation philosophy, please read the CD&A which discusses our executive compensation programs, including specific information about the compensation of our named executive officers for 2018. 
On behalf of the stockholders, the committee continually reviews current market practices and data, and our compensation programs and ancillary policies, in addition to actual executive compensation. The committee seeks to achieve the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our stockholders' interests. As a result of the committee's review in 2018, the committee took several important actions and maintained existing compensation practices, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Established objective financial goals, adjusted EBITDA and economic profit, for annual cash incentive award metrics based upon business unit and  corporate performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Eliminated individual performance goals  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provided no Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") benefits to newly appointed named executive officers (NEOs), consistent with our  benchmarking evaluation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintained compensation packages, with the assistance from an independent compensation consultant, so that each executive is within a competitive range  of total compensation for executives in comparable positions  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Placed a strong emphasis on variable compensation through our Annual Cash Incentive Award and performance share plans which are designed so that the  payout opportunity is directly linked to the achievement of pre-determined financial performance metrics  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Paid a limited perquisite allowance to our CEO and other NEOs  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligned annual incentive compensation plans between our executives and other employees to encourage a unified effort in achieving our goals and  objectives  
[END TABLE]
The above-referenced disclosures appear under the heading "Compensation of Executive Officers" in this proxy statement. 
We believe that proper administration of our executive compensation programs will result in attracting and retaining a management team that is motivated to lead our Company to improved fundamental financial performance furthering the long-term interests of LP and its stockholders. For these reasons, we recommend that stockholders vote "FOR" the following resolution and approve, on an advisory basis, the named executive officer compensation: 
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, executive compensation tables and accompanying footnotes and narrative discussion, is hereby approved."  The above resolution will be deemed to be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on this Item 3 at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast and, accordingly, will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. As this vote is an advisory vote, the outcome is not binding with respect to future executive compensation decisions, including those relating to our named executive officers. Our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors will, however, take the outcome of the vote into account in making future executive compensation decisions, as they have done in prior years. At LP's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of the votes cast on an advisory basis as to the frequency with which LP should conduct an advisory stockholder vote on the compensation of LP's executive officers (a "say-on-pay" vote) were cast in favor of conducting a say-on-pay vote annually. Accordingly, LP presently intends to conduct a say-on-pay vote annually until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes.  ITEM 4—APPROVAL OF THE 2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
Our Board of Directors adopted the ESPP on October 31, 2018, subject to stockholder approval on or before the 12 month anniversary of such date. Our stockholders are now being asked to approve the ESPP, including the reservation of shares for issuance thereunder. The principal features and purpose of the ESPP are summarized below. The following summary of the ESPP does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the ESPP and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the ESPP, which has been filed with the SEC as an Annex to this proxy statement. Any stockholder who wishes to obtain a copy of the ESPP may do so upon written request to the Secretary at our principal executive offices. 
Summary of the ESPP 
Purpose.  The purpose of the ESPP is to enable eligible employees of LP (and certain of its subsidiaries and/or parents) to acquire a proprietary interest in the future of the company through the purchase of Common Stock. The ESPP is intended to satisfy the requirements of an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code ("Section 423"), although it provides for both Section 423 and non-Section 423 components. 
Plan Administration.  The ESPP provides that the ESPP shall be administered by the Compensation Committee, or such other committee or subcommittee of the Board of Directors duly appointed to administer the ESPP (the "Administrator"), whose administration, interpretation and application of the ESPP and its terms will be final, conclusive and binding on all participants unless fraudulent or made in bad faith. The Administrator may adopt one or more sub-plans applicable to particular subsidiaries of LP or locations. 
Securities Subject to Plan.  The ESPP provides for up to 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the "ESPP Shares") to be reserved for issuance pursuant to purchases made under the ESPP, subject to adjustment as provided for in the plan. These shares will be made available from LP's authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Common Stock, shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market, or any combination thereof. If an outstanding purchase right for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled, the shares of Common Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of that purchase right shall again be available for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP Shares represent approximately 1.6% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of March 11, 2019. In establishing the ESPP Shares, our Board of Directors considered the potential dilutive impact to stockholders, the projected participation rate, equity plan guidelines established by certain proxy advisory firms and input from the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
Eligibility and Participation.  Employees of the LP and certain of its subsidiaries or parents are eligible to participate in the ESPP if they have been employed by LP (or by any subsidiary or parent designated for participation) for at least 30 days as of the first day of the offering period and they customarily work more than 20 hours per week for more than 5 months per calendar year. As of March 11, 2019, approximately 4,080 employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP, including 14 officers of LP. The ESPP currently has 570 participants. 
An employee will not be eligible to participate in the ESPP during an offering period to the extent that immediately after the grant of a purchase right, the employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to the employee under Section 424(d) of the Code) would own stock and/or hold outstanding purchase rights to purchase stock of LP or any parent or subsidiary possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of such corporation as determined in accordance with Section 423(b)(3) of the Code. Eligible employees become participants in the ESPP by delivering to the company prior to the applicable offering date a subscription agreement. At the end of each offering period, each participant in the offering period will be automatically enrolled in the next succeeding offering period at the same withholding percentage unless the participant changes his or her elections, withdraws from the ESPP, or terminates employment or otherwise ceases to be an eligible employee. 
Offering Periods and Dates.  Shares of Common Stock will be offered for purchase through a series of consecutive offering periods, each of which will generally be six months in duration, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator; provided, however, that no offering period will have a duration exceeding   27 months. For each offering period in which an employee participates, he or she will be granted a right to purchase Common Stock. 
Payroll Deductions.  The purchase price of the shares is accumulated by payroll deductions during the offering period. Each employee participating in the ESPP may elect to have up to 15% of regular cash compensation (subject to other limitations described in the ESPP) deducted and credited to that employee's account under the ESPP. An employee's regular cash compensation generally includes base wages or salary, overtime, shift differentials, payments for paid time off and payment in lien of notice. Cash compensation excludes variable compensation such as moving allowances, payments pursuant to a a severance agreement, termination pay, relocation payments, bonuses, commissions, compensation deferred under any program or plan (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 401(k) or Section 125 of the Code), any amounts directly or indirectly paid pursuant to the ESPP or any other stock purchase, stock option or other stock-based compensation plan, or any other compensation not included above. 
Payroll deductions will be credited to an account established in the employee's name, shall be held as general assets of LP and shall not accrue interest unless otherwise required by applicable law. To the extent that an employee's payroll deductions exceed the amount required to purchase shares subject to purchase rights, the excess shall be carried forward to apply to the next purchase date if the employee's participation in the ESPP continues and the excess is less than the amount that would have been necessary to purchase an additional whole share; otherwise, it will be refunded promptly after the purchase date to the employee without interest. 
Purchase of Common Stock; Exercise of Purchase Right.  By electing to participate in the ESPP, each employee is in effect granted a right to purchase shares of Common Stock using payroll deductions accumulated as of each of the purchase dates during any offering period. However, no participant may (i) accrue rights to purchase stock with a value in excess of $25,000 (determined on the basis of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the start date of the offering period) in any calendar year; or (ii) purchase shares of Common Stock in excess of either the dollar limit or the share limit applicable to an offering period. The dollar limit for an offering period is determined by multiplying $2,083 by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the offering period and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. The share limit for an offering period is determined by multiplying 208 shares by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the offering period and rounding to the nearest whole share. The share limit may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee prior to the start of an offering period. If the total number of shares for which purchase rights are to be exercised on any purchase date exceeds the number of shares at the time available for issuance under the ESPP, then the Administrator will prorate the available shares. An employee's purchase right will be exercised by applying the amount credited to the employee's account to the purchase of whole shares of Common Stock on each purchase date. If a balance remains in an employee's account because it is less than the price of one whole share, it will be carried over to the next offering period, if the employee's participation continues. 
Purchase Price of Common Stock; Taxes on the Acquisition or Disposition of Stock.  On any particular purchase date under the ESPP, the purchase price per share will be established by the Compensation Committee; provided, however, that such purchase price shall not be less than 85% of the lower of (i) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the first business day in such offering period or (ii) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the last business day in such offering period. On December 31, 2018, the closing market price of Common Stock was $22.22, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange. 
In general, the fair market value per share on any relevant date under the ESPP will be equal to the closing price quoted for such date by the principal exchange or trading market on which Common Stock is traded (as determined by the Administrator). If the Common Stock is not listed on a stock exchange or if trading activities for the Stock are not reported, the fair market value will be determined by the LP Board or the Administrator, consistent with applicable legal requirements. 
The participating employee shall be responsible for all taxes and generally all other withholdings required in connection with the acquisition or disposition of stock purchased under the ESPP. See "U.S. Federal Income Tax Information," below. The participating employee shall not have an interest or voting right in any shares covered under the ESPP prior to purchase.  Ability of the Committee to Amend or Terminate the ESPP.  The Committe may amend or terminate the ESPP, or any purchase right granted thereunder, at any time, except that no such amendment or termination will affect purchase rights previously granted under the ESPP unless expressly provided for by the Committee and no such amendment or termination may materially adversely affect a purchase right without the consent of a participant (unless permitted by the ESPP or as required by applicable law or to qualify the ESPP pursuant to Section 423 of the Code). Certain amendments may require the approval of the LP's stockholders. Unless the ESPP is earlier terminated, it will continue until the earlier of (i) the issuance of all Common Stock available for issuance under the ESPP and (ii) October 30, 2028. If the ESPP is terminated before an employee's right to purchase shares has been exercised under the ESPP, any funds deducted from the employee's compensation and credited to the employee's account under the ESPP shall be refunded. 
Withdrawal.  An employee may withdraw from the ESPP by delivering to the company a cancellation notice in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the company. Such cancellation notice must be delivered not later than 10 business days prior to the applicable purchase date to apply to that offering. An employee's withdrawal from an offering does not affect the employee's eligibility to participate in subsequent offerings under the ESPP. 
Termination of Employment.  Termination of a participant's continuous status as an employee for any reason, including retirement, death or disability, cancels his or her participation in the ESPP immediately. In such event, the payroll deductions credited to the employee's account will be returned to the employee or, in the case of death, to the person or persons entitled thereto as specified by the employee in the written designation of beneficiary. 
Capital Changes.  In the event any change is made in the capitalization of LP, such as a merger, stock split or stock dividend or any other material increase or decrease in the shares of LP stock without the company's receipt or payment of consideration, appropriate adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and class of securities issuable under the ESPP, (ii) the maximum number of securities purchasable per participant during an offering and (iii) the number and class of securities and the price per share in effect under each outstanding purchase right. Such adjustments will prevent any dilution or enlargement of the rights and benefits of plan participants. 
In the event of a change of control of LP, the surviving, continuing, successor or purchasing corporation (an "acquiring corporation") may assume or continue LP's rights and obligations under outstanding purchase rights or substitute substantially equivalent purchase rights for such acquiring corporation's stock. If such acquiring corporation elects not to assume, continue or substitute the purchase rights under the ESPP, the purchase date of the then-current offering period will be accelerated to a date before the change of control. All purchase rights that are neither assumed or continued by the acquiring corporation in connection with the change of control nor exercised as of the date of the change of control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the change of control. 
Nonassignability.  No rights or accumulated payroll deductions of an employee under the ESPP may be pledged, assigned or transferred for any reason, and any such attempt may be treated by LP as an election to withdraw from the ESPP. 
Reports. Individual accounts are maintained for each participant in the ESPP. After each purchase date, the participant's broker account will update with the number of shares purchased on behalf of the participant and the purchase price paid per share. The participant will also receive an annual statement of his or her plan account. 
Compliance with Securities Law.  The issuance of shares under the ESPP shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for LP with respect to such compliance. 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Information.  The ESPP is intended to qualify under the provisions of Sections 421 and 423 of the Code. Under these provisions, no income will be taxable to a participant at the time of grant of the right to purchase, or the actual purchase of, shares. However, upon the employee's disposition of shares   purchased under the ESPP, the participant will generally be subject to tax. Upon disposition, if the shares have been held by the participant for more than two years after the first day of the offering period and more than one year after the purchase date of the shares, the participant will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the disposition over the purchase price of the shares, or (ii) 15% of the fair market value of the shares on the first day of the applicable offering period. Any additional taxable gain on the disposition will be treated as a long-term capital gain. If the shares are disposed of before the expiration of the holding periods described above, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date over the purchase price will be taxable as ordinary income, and any gain or loss on such disposition will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The company is not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxable to a participant, except to the extent of ordinary income reported by the participant on disposition of shares before the expiration of the holding periods described above. 
The foregoing is only a summary of the United States Federal income tax consequences of the ESPP to participants and does not purport to be complete. Reference should be made to the applicable provisions of the Code. In addition, the summary does not discuss the income tax consequences of a participant's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which the participant may reside, and to which the participant may be subject. 
Restriction on Resale.  Certain officers and directors of LP may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the company, as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933. Common Stock acquired under the ESPP by an affiliate may only be reoffered or resold pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. 
New Plan Benefits.  Because benefits under the ESPP will depend on employees' elections to participate and the fair market value of Common Stock at various future dates, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by executive officers and other employees if the ESPP is approved by the stockholders. Non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP. 
We recommend that stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast in this Item 4 at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast and, accordingly, will have no effect on the outcome of this vote.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Section 16") requires that reports of beneficial ownership of Common Stock and changes in such ownership be filed with the SEC and the NYSE by LP's officers, directors, and certain other "reporting persons." Based solely upon a review of copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5 (and amendments thereto) filed by LP's reporting persons and written representations by such persons, to LP's knowledge, all Section 16 reporting requirements applicable to such persons were complied with for the period specified in the SEC's rules governing proxy statement disclosures.  COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee has oversight of compensation policies designed to align compensation with our overall business strategy, values and management initiatives. In discharging its oversight responsibility, the committee has retained an independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, to advise the committee regarding market and general compensation trends. 
The committee has affirmed the independence of its consultant through a review of the firm's independence policy and other relevant matters, and is not aware of any conflict of interest that would prevent the consultant from providing independent advice to the committee regarding executive compensation matters. The consultant is responsible solely to the committee and undertook no work with the management of the Company without approval from the committee chair. The consultant is not the beneficial owner of any shares of LP's Common Stock, and fees payable by LP to FW Cook during 2018 were less than 1% of the firm's gross revenues. 
The committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with our management, which has the responsibility for preparing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based upon this review and discussion, the committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.

To evaluate performance in a manner consistent with how management evaluates our operating results and trends, the Compensation Committee tracks certain business performance metrics (Adjusted EBITDA and Economic Profit) that are measured on a non-GAAP basis to both long-term and annual incentive awards. Please refer to LP's 2018 Annual Report on From 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a description and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP measures described in the Executive Summary below relative to reported GAAP financial measures. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
2018 Business and Financial Highlights 
LP delivered on multiple key financial and efficiency measures in 2018 versus the prior year. The measures marked with an * below are those that were directly linked to 2018 executive compensation.

2018 COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
We use our compensation program to attract, motivate and retain executives who lead our company. The Compensation Committee has established programs and practices designed to pay for performance and to align executives' interest with those of our stockholders. We believe our compensation program helps drive LP's   performance by providing compensation that is commensurate with performance. The 2018 executive compensation program was guided by the following core principles: 
Equity-based compensation aligns executives' interests with stockholders' interest, drives performance and facilitates retention of superior talent. We believe equity-based compensation aligns executives' interests with those of our stockholders. Annual equity awards consist of performance shares ("PSUs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Performance shares are settled in LP stock and are only paid out if the performance goals set for the three-year cumulative performance period are met. Final achievement is also subject to a TSR modifier relative to our peer group. In 2018, the goals were based upon value creating product ("VCP") growth and ROIC for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. VCP growth represents the increase in sales volumes from a specific group of products identified to enhance revenue, stabilize earnings (away from commodity pricing) and improve product portfolio diversity. Restricted stock units are time vesting awards that are settled in LP stock assuming the NEO remains employed through the vesting date or under certain retirement provisions. 
Incentive compensation drives increasing profits and returns. The committee strongly believes linking compensation to certain critical performance metrics results in increased profits and stronger returns, which support improving stockholder returns. For 2018, the company's annual cash incentive award plan ("ACIAP") of the NEOs was based upon Adjusted EBITDA (adjusted for commodity OSB price), economic profit and certain operational improvements. The committee determined for 2018 that operating results for incentive calculation purposes should not be influenced by increases nor decreases in commodity OSB pricing. An economic profit metric was added to further link asset utilization and financial performance. No amounts will be payable under the incentive compensation unless the minimum threshold for the company performance goal was achieved. 
Base salary represents the smallest portion of total target compensation. The committee continuously makes efforts to appropriately weight base salary and variable (annual cash and equity incentives) compensation for each NEO. Our target compensation mix for our CEO and our other executive officers reflects our emphasis on long-term, performance-based compensation that incentivizes our executive officers to make strategic decisions that will strengthen our business and create long-term value for our stockholders. performance-based compensation includes performance shares and the ACIAP. In 2018, 51% of our CEO's target compensation and 41% of our other executive officers' target compensation was performance-based, as shown in the graphs below.  The following chart summarizes annual total target compensation awarded to each NEO in 2018:

RESULTS OF THE 2018 SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
In 2018, we sought an advisory vote from our stockholders on NEO compensation (commonly referred to as "Say-on-Pay vote"). Approximately 92% of the votes cast for Say-on-Pay vote were in support of the LP's executive compensation program. Even with this strong endorsement of the company's pay practices, the committee believes it is essential to regularly review the executive compensation program. In 2018, the committee concluded the compensation program provides rewards that motivates our NEOs to maximize long-term stockholder value and encourage retention. In 2018, the committee increased the percentage of PSUs to 50% reducing the percentage of SSARS with the performance period covering three years, further linking performance and pay. 
CORPORATE GOVERANCE 
The committee recognizes that the success of our executive compensation program over the long-term requires a robust framework of compensation governance. As a result, the committee regularly reviews external compensation practices and trends and incorporates best practices into our executive compensation program.  ELEMENTS AND PHILOSOPHY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Elements 
For 2018, there were no new elements of compensation provided to the CEO or other NEOs. The following table outlines the objectives and purposes of each element of LP's executive compensation program:

 Review of Peer Group and Survey Data for Comparison Purposes 
To ensure that our compensation programs are reasonable and competitive in the marketplace, the committee compares our programs to our peers. The committee believes that the current peer group companies (for 2018 compensation) reflect similarities in channels, business cycles, and manufacturing expertise, thus providing appropriate benchmark data. The peer group contains the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Allegion PLC       Lennox International 
   American Woodmark       Masco 
   A. O. Smith       Masonite International 
   Armstrong World Industries       NCI Building Systems 
   Boise Cascade       Owens Corning 
   Builders FirstSource       Simpson Manufacturing Company 
   Fortune Brands Home & Security       Universal Forest Products 
   Gibraltar Industries       USG 
   Griffon     
[END TABLE]
The committee, with input and advice from its independent consultant, has developed the customized peer group for review of executive compensation levels and plan design practices. The committee, in conjunction with its consultant, periodically reviews the peer group, and revises it as appropriate to ensure that it continues to represent similar U.S. organizations with which we compete for executive talent. During 2018, changes to the peer group included the removal of Quanex (based upon company size), Ply Gem Holdings (acquired in April 2018) and the addition of Allegion PLC, Masonite International and NCI Building Systems. 
FW Cook also reviews two confidential, third-party surveys in order to benchmark LP's executive compensation where appropriate. Both surveys were "general industry" sources, from which aggregate results were compiled using the appropriate revenue bands. Data was then interpolated to LP's revenue of approximately $2.9 billion. A similar methodology was used for LP's business unit executives using size-appropriate revenue bands and LP business unit revenues. 
In 2018, the committee relied on both peer group and survey data to more clearly understand the relevant market for executive talent and to help inform its decision-marking and ensure that the Company's executive compensation program supports the LP's recruitment and retention needs and is fair and efficient. Specifically, the committee compared each executive's base salary, total cash compensation opportunities (salary and target cash incentive award), and total direct compensation opportunities (salary, target cash incentive award, and annualized grant-date present value of equity-based awards) for 2018 against comparable information from the peer group and survey data. The committee believes using several benchmark data sources improves the quality of comparison because it may be difficult to identify an appropriate match for some officer positions within the peer group alone. In addition, the survey data reflects the broader industries with which LP competes for management talent.  Base Salaries 
In setting 2018 salary levels, the committee (together with Mr. Southern for the NEOs other than himself) considered market data, individual performance and competitiveness of total direct compensation of each NEO. In March of 2018 (and further adjusted for Mr. Southern in August 2018), each NEO received an annual base salary increase ranging as indicated below.

Achievement of Performance Goals for 2018 
In 2018, LP's ACIAP metrics were corporate financial goals, certain corporate operational goals and business unit financial performance goals. 
Corporate financial goals. The 2018 ACIAP performance metrics included an adjusted EBITDA and economic profit goal. The adjusted EBITDA goal threshold was $524 million, with a target of $657 million, and a maximum payment achieved at $756 million. No amounts would have been payable under the plan unless the minimum threshold was achieved. The targets were adjusted to neutralize commodity OSB pricing to focus on core performance. Our reported 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $660 million exceeded the target goal level. An economic profit goal (adjusted to neutralize commodity OSB pricing) was also added with a threshold of $176 million, a target of $274 million and a maximum achievement of $429 million. Our 2018 economic profit of $284 million exceeded the target goal. 
Corporate Operational goals. The committee established corporate operational goals related to safety and overall equipment effectiveness ("OEE"). The safety goal was established based upon LP's Total Incident Rate ("TIR") with a threshold of 0.60, a target of 0.50 and a maximum of 0.40. The OEE goal measures LP's ability to improve manufacturing productivity. The goal was established with an OEE improvement threshold of 0.71%, a target of 1.41% and a maximum of 2.12%. 
Business unit performance goals. The committee established specific business unit financial and operational goals to be included in the 2018 ACIAP. 
Following the end of the year, performance is assessed against those goals to determine the CEO's and each other NEO's level of achievement. Each goal is assigned a value based on a variety of factors which can result in the performance component ranging from 0-200% based on the level of attainment. 
The committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to reduce or eliminate the payout of annual cash incentives, despite its determination that performance was at or above the threshold level, if it finds that paying the awards is not in the best interest of LP.  The committee established weightings for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, General Counsel for 2018 as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Operational    Meet or exceed Safety metric    20% 
   Meet or exceed OEE metric

Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation 
The committee awards long-term incentive equity grants to the CEO and the other NEOs as part of their overall compensation package. These awards are consistent with the committee's objectives of aligning our senior leaders with the financial interests of our stockholders, focusing on long-term success, supporting pay-for-performance, and offering competitive compensation packages. This component comprises the largest aspect of the executives total compensation package with vesting tied to multi-year performance goals and service. The following table summarized the award opportunities for 2018.

 Neil Sherman    $ 200,000      $ 200,000      $ 400,000   
[END TABLE]
The committee determined that awards to the CEO and the other NEOs under the Stock Award Plan would be split between RSUs (50%) and PSUs (50%), based on the relative grant date fair values of the awards. 
The 2018 performance share plan design includes a three-year return on invested capital ("ROIC") with threshold, target and maximum goals as approved by the committee and a three-year value-creating product volume growth for a predetermined portfolio of products. If the performance goals are met at the end of the performance period, the award will be adjusted to reflect LP's 3 year TSR performance relative to a capital market peer group. This TSR modifier can increase or decrease the award by 20%, although the TSR modifier cannot cause the award to exceed the maximum of 200%. The capital market peer group includes the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   A. O. Smith       Norbord 
   Armstrong World Industries       Ply Gem Holdings 
   Boise Cascade       Owens Corning

The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved performance against pre-established targets for the 2016-2018 cycle. Payout amounts for 2016-2018 performance shares were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year Granted     Performance Period     Goal    Weighting    Result    Target% of target attained 
 2016    1 year    LP Revenue Growth   50%   18%   12%   200% 
[END TABLE]
LP's TSR performance relative to the capital market peer group described above was between the 25th and 75th percentile and therefore no adjustment was made in terms of payout.  Retirement & Other Benefits 
LP's qualified retirement plans are designed to provide retirement benefits at a competitive level compared peers and the general manufacturing industry. All full-time salaried and hourly U.S. employees participate in LP's 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan. The company's Retirement Account Plan, a defined benefit plan, was frozen effective January 1, 2010. U.S. employees hired prior to this date remain participants in the plan, but no further credits will be earned by the participants. 
Employees in the top two levels of LP's management, including executive officers, participate in LP's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the plan, participants may defer the receipt of up to 90% of base salary and annual bonuses for income tax purposes, and receive five percent of their contributions matched. In addition, the plan enables executives and other highly-compensated employees to obtain benefits comparable to those available under the 401(k) plan without being subject to the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on tax-qualified plans. 
LP maintains a SERP that provides retirement pension benefits to select, grandfathered NEOs. SERP benefits have not been provided to newly appointed NEOs, consistent with our benchmarking evaluation. The SERP benefits generally do not vest until an officer has been a participant for five years, and are reduced by the value of employer contributions under LP's other retirement plans and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, as well as a portion of a participant's Social Security benefits. As of March 26, 2019, no benefits remain to be paid under this plan. 
Additional information about LP's retirement plans is provided in the Summary Compensation Table, the Pension Benefits Table, and the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. The committee believes the retirement benefit plans described above are important parts of our compensation program, and the committee will continue to review them periodically to ensure competitiveness. 
Other Compensation 
We provide our CEO and NEOs with limited perquisites, consisting of retirement, long-term disability and life insurance benefits, and personal estate and financial planning services through independent providers. These benefits are discussed in more detail in note 5 to the Summary Compensation Table. 
Executive Change of Control Employment Agreements 
Change of Control Employment Agreements with our executive officers provide for the payment of severance compensation and other benefits if the officer's employment is terminated for specified reasons within three years following the occurrence of a change of control of LP. Such reasons include (a) termination by LP other than for cause and (b) termination by the officer because, among other things, his/her assigned duties, position, or authority are diminished in a material way, his/her compensation is substantially reduced, he/she is required to move his/her workplace more than 50 miles, or he/she has substantially increased travel requirements. Severance benefits under the agreements include; a cash payment in an amount equal to three times the sum of the officer's annual base salary and target bonus amount; enhanced benefits under LP's retirement plans; and vesting of equity awards but does not include any tax gross-up provisions. 
The committee believes these agreements are important to encourage our CEO and NEOs to continue to work in the best interests of LP and its stockholders in a potential change of control situation, and to evaluate any possible transactions with the maximum degree of independence and objectivity. The terms of the agreements are described in more detail under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control". 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SUMMARY FOR 2019 
As part of the establishment of the 2019 executive compensation targets, the Compensation Committee, in conjunction with its compensation consultant, reviewed the peer group to ensure it represented similar U.S. organizations with which we compete for executive talent. No changes were made in LP's peer group for 2019 as a result of this review.  2019 Annual Salaries 
On February 8, 2019, the committee approved the following salaries for certain of our NEOs and our new CFO. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentive Award Plan 
The committee approved in February 2019 the 2019 Annual Cash Incentive Award Plan. The 2019 plan will be based 70% on the corporate financial performance metrics and 30% on the business financial results for Mr. Southern, Haughie and Mann. The 2019 plan for Mr. Ringblom and Sherman will be based 40% on the company financial performance and 60% on the executive specific business unit financial performance. For the 2019 plan, no operational goals are included. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The committee awards long-term equity incentive grants to CEO and the other NEOs as part of their overall compensation package. These awards are consistent with the committee's objectives of aligning the financial interests of our executives with the financial interests of our stockholders, focusing on our long-term success, supporting our high performance-oriented culture, and offering competitive compensation packages. The long-term equity grant for 2019 will consist of 50% time-based RSUs (3-year cliff vesting) and 50% PSUs. 
The committee approved the 2019 performance share plan which was a 3-year performance period consisting of two metrics, each with a threshold, target and maximum goal. These metrics include: (1) 3-year ROIC and (2) 3-year SmartSide Strand and OSB structural solutions product volume growth. If the threshold goal is met at the end of the performance period, the award will be adjusted to reflect LP's 3 year TSR performance relative to a capital market peer group. This TSR modifier can increase or decrease the award by up to 20%. The TSR modifier cannot cause the award to exceed the maximum of 200%. 
ADDITIONAL POLICIES AND GUIDELINES AFFECTING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Use of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The committee engaged FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant to assist in determining the appropriate executive officer compensation in 2018 pursuant to our compensation policies. FW Cook had no other business relationship with LP and received no payments from us other than fees for services to the committee and the Nominating Committee. See "Corporate Governance-Compensation Committee" for additional information about our use of compensation consultants. 
Timing of Long-Term Equity Grants 
Our policies require restricted stock and performance awards to be valued at grant based upon the closing price of our stock on the grant day of the award. The committee's practice is to make equity awards at its first committee meeting in a given year (generally in the last week of January or the first week of February). Committee meeting dates are set by the committee at least one year in advance. 
Policy on Incentive Compensation Clawback 
A significant percentage of our executive officer compensation is incentive based. The determination of the extent to which the incentive objectives are achieved is based in part on the committee's discretion and in part on   our financial results. The committee has the right to reassess its determination of the performance awards if the financial statements on which it relied are restated. The committee has the authority to direct LP to seek to recover (i.e. "clawback") from any executive officer any amounts determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandates that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer reimburse LP for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation paid to them in a year following the issuance of financial statements that are later required to be restated as a result of misconduct. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We strongly believe the financial interests of our executives should be aligned with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, the committee has established meaningful stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers. 
Executive officers are expected to own shares of our Common Stock in an amount equivalent to a multiple of the executive officer's annual base salary as follows: for the Chief Executive Officer, five times; for the Chief Financial Officer and the other Executive Vice Presidents, three times. These are measured annually at the first regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting of the calendar year. 
Restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the Stock Award Plan that have not yet vested count toward the ownership guidelines, but performance shares where the initial metric has yet to be met and shares subject to outstanding stock options and SSARs do not count. NEOs who have not met their ownership guidelines, and wish to exercise SSARs, are required to hold shares equal to 40 percent of the after tax proceeds of any exercised SSARs until they reach their target as of the last compliance date. For 2018, the CEO and all other NEOs met their ownership guidelines with the exception of Mr. Ringblom and Mr. Mann. 
Insider Trading and Anti-Hedging/Anti-Pledging Policy 
Our Insider Trading policy mandates that insiders, including executive officers, review transactions involving our securities with our Chief Financial Officer or legal department prior to entering into the transactions and prohibits a covered officer from pledging or engaging in transactions for the purpose of hedging the economic risk of his or her current or future ownership of shares. 
Tax Deduction for Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers to $1,000,000 per year. Prior to January 1, 2018, there was an exception to this deductibility limitation for performance-based compensation that met certain regulatory requirements. This exception has been repealed such that compensation paid to certain executives in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has generally intended for several types of our executive compensation, including SSAR awards to executive officers to qualify for this performance-based exception. Other classes of executive compensation, including the restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants described above, may be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit. Furthermore, even if we have intended to grant compensation that qualifies for the performance-based exception, we cannot guarantee that such compensation will so qualify or ultimately will be deductible by the Company. Although tax deductibility of compensation is preferred, deductibility is not a primary objective of our compensation programs.  Risk Assessment of Executive Pay Policies and Practices 
The committee conducted a review of LP's pay practices in 2018 to determine if there were any policies and practices that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on LP. The review included non-executive and executive pay policies and practices. The non-executive pay practices were reviewed by LP's Risk Council and reviewed by the committee. In addition, the committee reviewed executive pay policies and practices. The committee's independent compensation consultant participated in that review and discussion. The committee found no compensation policies or practices that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on LP and that the design of our compensation programs encourage the achievement of both our short-term and long-term operational and financial goals and contain certain appropriate risk mitigating features such as incentive caps for the ACIAP and PSUs and stock ownership guidelines.

 Pension Benefits for 2018 
The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits for each of the NEOs under LP's SERP and LP's Retirement Account Plan, in each case assuming retirement by the executive at age 62. Amounts shown in the table were calculated as of a December 31, 2018 measurement date consistent with LP's financial statements and using the same long-term rate of return, discount rate, rate of compensation increase, and mortality rate assumptions used in the financial statements. See Note 22 to LP's audited financial statements included in its 2018 Form 10-K.

 Neil Sherman     Retirement Account Plan       25     $ 112,782     $ —     
(1)  At December 31, 2018, all NEOs participating in the SERP and Retirement Account Plan (where applicable) were vested in their benefits  thereunder (subject to early retirement reductions, if applicable). Note that Ms. Bailey is not a participant in the Retirement Account Plan and Messrs. Southern, Ringblom, Sherman and Kinney are not participants in the SERP.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Ms. Bailey retired July 13, 2018. The SERP amount reflected was paid in early 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
The SERP was a defined benefit plan intended to provide supplemental retirement benefits to key executives designated by LP's Chief Executive Officer and the committee. LP closed the SERP to new participants in 2013. Therefore Ms. Bailey is the only participant in LP's SERP plan as of December 31, 2018. 
Key features of the SERP include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting.  Participants are fully vested in their SERP benefits after participating in the SERP for five years. Vesting is accelerated  in the event of the participants death or disability or a change of control of LP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retirement Age.  The normal retirement age under the SERP is 62.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Benefits.  The annual benefit payable under the SERP to a participant who retires at the normal retirement age is equal  to 50% of the executive's final average compensation multiplied by a fraction equal to: years of credited service (up to a maximum of 15)/15. For example, if a participant had final average compensation of $500,000 with ten years of credited  service, his or her annual benefit (subject to reductions for other retirement benefits as described below) would be $166,667 calculated as: $500,000 x .50 x (10/15).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Years of Credited Service.  Years of credited service under the SERP are equal to the participant's years of service  credited under the Retirement Account Plan discussed below. If a participant's employment is involuntarily terminated within 36 months after a change of control of LP, he or she is credited with two additional years of service.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Final Average Compensation.  Final average compensation on an annual basis is equal to a participant's compensation during the  60 consecutive months out of the last 120 months of employment in which the participant's compensation was highest, divided by five. Compensation for this purpose includes base salary plus annual bonus paid to a participant or deferred  under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (described below), but excludes all other benefits. If LP terminates a participant's employment other than for cause or the participant terminates for good reason within 36 months after a change of  control of  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     LP, benefits under the SERP will be calculated based on the participant's base salary during the preceding 12 months plus the average annual cash incentive paid in the preceding three years,  if higher than final average compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Early Retirement Provisions.  Retirement benefits under the SERP are subject to reduction in the event of retirement before age 62.  When a participant retires prior to age 55, his or her annual benefit as described above is reduced by a fraction equal to his actual credited years of service over the number of years of credited service the participant would have had at age 62. If  a participant retires between age 55 and age 61, the amount of the reduction to his annual benefit as described above depends on whether the committee administering the plan approves the retirement. If the participant's early retirement is  approved by the committee, his or her annual benefit is reduced by 3% for each year prior to age 62. If the committee does not approve the participant's early retirement, his or her benefit is reduced by 5% for each year prior to age 62 and is  further reduced by a fraction equal to the participant's actual years of credited service over the years of credited service the participant would have had at age 62. Termination of a participant's employment by LP other than for cause or  termination by a participant for good reason within 36 months of a change of control is treated as an early retirement with committee approval, regardless of the participant's age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reductions for Other Retirement Benefits.  The annual benefits payable under the SERP are reduced by an amount equal to the sum of  (1) 50% of the participant's primary Social Security benefit determined at age 62 and (2) the value of employer contributions under LP's other retirement plans and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disability Benefit.   If a participant is unable to continue employment due to a disability, the benefit is calculated in the  same manner as if the participant retired at age 62, and credit for years of service accrues during the disability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Form of Payment.   The normal form of payment under the SERP is a single lump sum payment that is actuarially equivalent to a  life annuity payable monthly in the amount of the monthly SERP benefit. Other forms of payment available under the SERP must also be actuarially equivalent to a life annuity payable monthly. Ms. Bailey has elected a lump sum payment. If the  participant retires at age 62 or later, payments commence six months after retirement. If the participant retires prior to age 62, payments commence as of a date specified in advance by the participant but not earlier than age 62.

All employees who are in LP's top two levels of management and participate in its Retirement Account Plan and the profit sharing component of the 401(k) plan are automatically participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Key features of the Deferred Compensation Plan include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deferrals.   The Deferred Compensation Plan permits deferrals of up to 90% of a participant's base salary and annual  bonuses.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Matching Contributions by LP.   The qualified 401(k) plan match and the EDCP match is 5% of contributions.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Supplemental Credit.   LP credits each participating employee's plan account with an amount that would have been contributed  under LP's profit sharing component of its 401(k) plan if limits imposed under the Internal Revenue Code did not apply. The Retirement Account Plan supplemental credit ceased after 2009.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Make-up Credit.   LP credits each participating employee's plan account with an  amount that would have been contributed under LP's profit sharing component of its 401(k) plan had the participant not deferred compensation. The Retirement Account Plan make-up credit was discontinued  effective January 1, 2010 as a component of LP's discontinuation of its defined benefit plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting.   Participants are immediately vested in credits for their contributions and related earnings. Participants are vested  in their rights to LP's matching contributions and related earnings after two years of service to LP and are vested in their rights to supplemental and make-up credits and related earnings in accordance  with the vesting schedule of the profit sharing component of the 401(k) plan. Participants will also become vested in LP's matching contributions, supplemental credits, and make-up credits upon reaching  age 65 or immediately upon death, disability, or a termination within 24 months following a change of control of LP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
LP has not entered into employment agreements with its NEOs, except for the Change of Control Employment Agreements described below. Therefore, its executive officers are not generally entitled to severance benefits upon termination of employment in the absence of a change of control. A description of payments and benefits to be provided to LP's NEOs under various circumstances involving termination of employment and/or a change of control follows. 
Payments and Benefits upon Termination Prior to Change of Control.  Upon termination of a NEOs' employment for any reason prior to a change of control of LP, he or she is entitled to receive amounts earned while employed, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payment of base salary through the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accrued vacation pay through the date of termination for LP's named executive officers at December 31, 2018, was as follows:  Mr. Southern $129,258; Mr. Mann $13,949; Mr. Ringblom $51,716; and Mr. Sherman $51,716; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other benefits, to the extent vested, required to be paid under the terms of any other plan, program or arrangement maintained by LP, including,  without limitation, retirement benefits payable under LP's Retirement Account Plan and SERP, as described under "Pension Benefits for 2018, and benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as described under "Nonqualified Deferred  Compensation for 2018".  
[END TABLE]
The amounts listed above are referred to as "accrued obligations."  If an executive dies or if his or her employment is terminated due to disability, he or she will be paid his or her target award under the ACIAP. Upon termination of employment due to death or disability, all equity-based awards will become fully vested under the Stock Award Plan. Vesting of equity-based awards is not accelerated upon termination for any other reason in the absence of a change of control. Vesting of certain benefits under the SERP and the Deferred Compensation Plan is accelerated upon death or disability, as described under "Pension Benefits for 2018" and under "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018". 
The aggregate payments and benefits, in addition to accrued obligations due to the employee, that LP's NEOs would have received, assuming termination upon death or disability on December 31, 2018, prior to the occurrence of a change of control, were as follows: Mr. Southern $5,263,311; Mr. Mann $1,178,171; Mr. Ringblom $1,102,186; and Mr. Sherman $1,523,178, representing the sum of the value on that date of restricted stock and units, performance shares, and SSARs subject to accelerated vesting and the executive's target award for 2018 under the ACIAP. 
Change of Control Employment Agreements.   The Change of Control Employment Agreements provide for compensation and benefits following a change of control of LP, including severance payments and benefits in the event the executive officer's employment is terminated. 
Term.   The agreements will terminate two years after LP gives the executive written notice. If a change of control of LP occurs prior to that date, the term will be extended automatically for three additional calendar years beyond the date on which the change of control occurs. This three-year period is referred to as the "change of control period." 
Definition of Certain Terms.   Brief summaries of the definitions of certain terms used in the agreements are set forth below. 
"Change of Control" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of LP's outstanding Common Stock or voting securities, with certain  exceptions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A change in the composition of the Board of Directors such that the incumbent directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board  (including, for purposes of computing a majority, those persons nominated for election by a majority of the then incumbent directors who had been similarly nominated);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Completion of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the assets of LP, with certain exceptions; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approval by LP's stockholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of LP.  
[END TABLE]
"Cause" means one of the following actions, as determined by the vote of at least 75% of the directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The willful and continued failure of the executive to substantially perform his or her duties after delivery of a written demand for substantial  performance; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The willful engaging by the executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct that materially harms LP.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason" for purposes of an executive's termination of his or her employment with LP means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's position, authority, duties, or responsibilities are diminished;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any failure by LP to comply with the compensation provisions of the agreement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transfer of the executive to a location more than 50 miles from the present location or a substantial increase in the amount the executive is  required to travel;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any purported termination by LP of the executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by the agreement; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any failure by LP to require the successor to assume and agree to perform the Change in Control Employment Agreement.  
[END TABLE]
 Payments and Benefits While Employed Following Change of Control. During the change of control period and for so long as a covered executive remains employed by LP (or its successor), he or she is entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Receive an annual base salary in an amount at least equal to 12 times the executives highest monthly base salary paid during the 12 months immediately  preceding the month of the change of control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be paid an annual cash bonus in an amount at least equal to the executive's target bonus for the year in which the change of control occurs; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Participate in all incentive, savings and retirement plans, welfare benefit programs, personal benefits and paid vacation available to other peer  executives on, generally, at least as favorable terms as those in place during the 120-day period immediately preceding the change of control.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, all outstanding equity-based awards held by LP's NEOs, including stock options, SSARs, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, will become vested or exercisable in full upon a change of control of LP. 
The annual base salary levels and target bonuses for LP's NEOs during 2018 are disclosed under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Information regarding benefits provided to LP's NEOs in addition to salary and cash incentive payments during 2018 appears in the Summary Compensation Table. If a change of control of LP had occurred on December 31, 2018, these salary and bonus levels and benefits would represent the minimum amounts that would have been payable to LP's NEOs in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, unless their employment was terminated during that three-year change of control period. 
The aggregate benefits and payments, in addition to accrued obligations, that LP's NEOs would have received assuming a change of control occurred on December 31, 2018, without termination of employment, were as follows: Mr. Southern $4,071,497, Mr. Mann $3,482,928, Mr. Ringblom $1,045,705, and Mr. Sherman $1,666,685, each representing the sum of the value on that date of restricted stock, incentive shares and SSARs subject to accelerated vesting and the executive's target award for 2018 under the ACIAP. 
Payments and Benefits Upon Termination Following Change of Control.   The severance compensation and benefits payable under the Change of Control Employment Agreements upon the termination of an NEOs' employment vary depending on the reason for termination, as described below. 
Termination Without Good Reason or by LP for Cause.   If an NEO voluntarily terminates his or her employment other than for good reason, or LP terminates his or her employment for cause, during a change of control period, he or she will be entitled to payment or satisfaction by LP of all accrued obligations, but will not be entitled to any other severance or benefits. 
Death or Disability.   If an NEO dies or his or her employment is terminated due to disability during a change of control period, the executive or his or her legal representative will be entitled to payment of all accrued obligations and a pro rata amount of the executive's target bonus for the year in which the change of control occurs, based on the number of days in the year prior to death or termination. The aggregate payments and benefits, in addition to accrued obligations, that LP's named executive officers would have received, assuming death or termination due to disability on December 31, 2018, during a change of control period, were as follows: Mr. Southern $10,522,663, Mr. Mann $3,482,928, Mr. Ringblom $2,895,641 and Mr. Sherman $3,290,644, representing the sum of the value on that date of restricted stock, performance shares, incentive shares and SSARs subject to accelerated vesting and the executive's target award for 2018 under the ACIAP. Assuming that the change of control and the termination due to death or disability occurred in the same year, these are the same amounts that an executive would receive upon a change of control without any termination, as described further under "Payments and Benefits While Employed Following Change of Control" above. 
Termination for Good Reason or Other than for Cause, Death or Disability.   If, during a change of control period, an NEO's employment with LP is terminated by LP (other than for cause, death or disability) or by the   executive for good reason, he or she will be entitled to receive the following amounts in a lump-sum payment six months after termination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary through the date of termination (at a monthly rate at least equal to the highest rate in effect during the 12 months prior to the date the  change of control occurred) plus a pro rata amount of target bonus for the fiscal year in which the change of control occurred;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amount equal to three times the sum of (x) annual base salary at such rate at the time of the change in control, plus (y) the target bonus  amount;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The difference, calculated on an actuarial present value basis, between the retirement benefits that would have accrued under the Retirement Account  Plan and the SERP if employment continued for an additional three years and the actual vested benefit, if any, under those plans (including any enhancement under the terms of the SERP triggered by the change of control) at the date of termination;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Interest on the amounts described above from the date of termination through the payment date.  
[END TABLE]
The Change of Control Employment Agreements also provide for reimbursement of fees for outplacement services, financial counseling, estate planning and for the continuation of health, disability and life insurance benefits for three years. 
Acceleration of or increases to certain benefits under the terms of the SERP and the Deferred Compensation Plan that are triggered if an NEO is terminated following a change of control are described under "Pension Benefits for 2018-Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for 2018." 
Potential Pay-Outs to Current Named Executive Officers. The following table shows potential pay-outs under the Change of Control Employment Agreements and other LP benefit plans assuming that the employment of a current NEO was terminated following a change of control of LP, either by LP for reasons other than cause, death or disability, or by the executive for good reason, and that termination occurred on the last business day of 2018. Ms. Bailey's retirement benefits are described in the narrative above.

[END TABLE]
CEO PAY RATIO 
For the 2018 fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of W. Bradley Southern, our CEO ("CEO Compensation"), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees and those of our consolidated subsidiaries other than our CEO ("Median Annual Compensation") was 62 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation as the "Median Employee." For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was October 1, 2017 (the "Determination Date"), as, in accordance with SEC requirements, we have determined that there have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements in 2018 that we believe would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. 
CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr. Southern under "2018 Summary Compensation Table" for 2018, plus personal benefits. 
For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $86,064, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for 2018 in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K plus personal benefits and compensation under benefit plans otherwise not reportable under this Item. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the Median Employee. 
As previously disclosed, to identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date. We had 4,639 employees (other than the CEO), representing all full-time, part-time,   seasonal and temporary employees of us and our consolidated subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or "leased" workers, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. Of our 4,639 total employees, approximately 496 (or 11%) are employed in Chile and approximately 215 (less than 5%) are employed in Brazil. We have chosen to exclude all 215 Brazilian employees in determining our Median Employee, as permitted under the de minimis exemption to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We used our number of total employees (4,639) in making our de minimis calculation. 
We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on September 30, 2017 for 4,424 employees (after the permitted exclusions noted above). This compensation measurement was calculated by totaling, for each employee, salary as shown in our payroll records for the first nine months. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year due to commencing employment after the beginning of the fiscal year. In determining the Median Employee, we did not annualize the total compensation for such individuals.  DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION 
The following table summarizes compensation paid to outside directors for services during 2018.

(1)  Each director not an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, receives an annual cash retainer of $80,000. The Chairman of the  Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Compensation Committee each receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000. The Chairman of Nominating and the Environmental, Quality Compliance Committee each receive received an additional annual cash  retainer of $10,000 except the Chairman of the Board, who receives an annual cash retainer of $175,000 for his service which was subsequently increased to $225,000. This additional annual retainer recognizes the additional time commitment for this  role compared to other non-employee directors, which includes: (i) managing meetings of the Board of Directors, leading the work to set the agenda for Board meetings, leading the Board's annual chief  executive officer performance review, and representing the Board at the annual shareholders meeting, (ii) meeting with LP's shareholders, (iii) acting as an adviser to management on strategic aspects of the chief executive officer  role with regular consultations on major developments and decisions that are likely to be of interest to the Board, and (iv) when requested, interacting with external audiences.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts shown reflect the fair value as of the date of grant with respect to awards of restricted stock units under LP's 2013 Omnibus  Plan. The plan provides for annual grants of restricted stock units payable in shares of Common Stock with a market value on the grant date of $120,000 (which equals the grant date fair value of such awards), or such lower amount as the Nominating  Committee determines, to each non-employee director of LP. The shares vest in full on the earliest to occur of one year following the grant date, upon the director's death, disability or retirement (as  defined), or a change of control of LP. If the director ceases to be a director before the restrictions lapse, the shares are forfeited. At December 31, 2018, each of LP's outside directors held RSUs for 4,323 shares which vest on  May 12, 2019.

Under the policy, a conflict of interest means any situation in which the personal interests of an employee, officer, or director are potentially in conflict with the interests of LP. The policy applies to all transactions between LP and business entities affiliated with LP's officers and directors. 
The policy requires potential conflicts of interest involving a member of the Board or LP's Chief Executive Officer to be reviewed by the full Board. The policy requires potential conflicts of interest involving an executive officer (other than the Chief Executive Officer) to be reviewed by the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Upon review of the conflict of interest, the Board or Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, is required to determine whether the transaction or relationship may proceed. Both disclosure of the potential conflict by the interested party and the results of any review by the Board or Chief Executive Officer are required to be communicated in writing. Approval of any transaction or relationship may be conditioned on implementation of safeguards, controls, or limitations on the individual's involvement in the transaction or relationship. Ongoing conflicts are reviewed under the policy annually.  In addition, the Audit Committee's charter provides that it will, on an annual basis and at such other times as may be requested by the Board, review completed and proposed transactions between LP and any current or former director or executive officer of LP (including transactions involving family members or affiliates of directors or executive officers). The purpose of the Audit Committee's review is to help the Board determine if directors are independent, identify potential conflicts of interest, and identify related person transactions required to be disclosed in LP's proxy materials under applicable SEC disclosure requirements. In 2018, the Finance and Audit Committee and the full Board determined that there were no related person transactions that affect the independence of any of LP's outside directors or that require disclosure in this proxy statement. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Any stockholder who intends to present a proposal at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of LP in 2020, and who wishes to have the proposal included in LP's proxy materials for that meeting, must deliver the proposal to the Corporate Secretary of LP no later than November 24, 2019. Any such proposal must meet the informational and other requirements set forth in the SEC's rules and regulations in order to be eligible for inclusion in the proxy materials for that meeting. 
LP's Bylaws also provide that no business may be brought before an annual meeting except as specified in the notice of the meeting or as otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by a stockholder of record who has delivered written notice thereof to the Chairman by the deadline specified in the bylaws. In the case of next year's annual meeting, this notice must be received by LP no earlier than January 8, 2020 and no later than February 7, 2020. Such notice must meet the informational and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws in order to be eligible to be brought before an annual meeting. The meeting chairman may, if the facts warrant, determine that any such business was not properly brought before the meeting and so declare to the meeting, in which case such business shall not be transacted. 
GENERAL 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by LP. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by the use of the mails, some of the officers and regular employees of LP, without extra compensation, may solicit proxies personally or by other means such as telephone, telecopier, or e-mail. 
LP will request brokers, dealers, banks, voting trustees, and their nominees who hold Common Stock of record to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of such stock and will reimburse such record holders for their reasonable expenses in forwarding material.  Annex A

Any of the provisions of any such sub-plan may supersede the provisions of this Plan, other than Section 4. Except as superseded by the provisions of a sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern such sub-plan. Alternatively and in order to comply with the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the Committee shall have the power, in its discretion, to grant Purchase Rights in an Offering to citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens) that provide terms which are less favorable than or different from the terms of Purchase Rights granted under the same Offering to Employees resident in the United States. 
(d)    Power to Establish Separate Offerings with Varying Terms. The Committee shall have the power, in its discretion, to establish separate, simultaneous or overlapping Offerings having different terms and conditions and to designate the Participating Company or Companies that may participate in a particular Offering, provided that each Offering shall individually comply with the terms of the Plan and the requirements of Section 423(b)(5) of the Code that all Participants granted Purchase Rights pursuant to such Offering shall have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of such section. 
(e)    Policies and Procedures Established by the Company.

(f)    Indemnification. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or the Committee or as officers or employees of the Participating Company Group, to the extent permitted by applicable law, members of the Board or the Committee and any officers or employees of the Participating Company Group to whom authority to act for the Board, the Committee or the Company is delegated shall be indemnified by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall offer to the Company, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN.   
[END TABLE]
(a)    Maximum Number of Shares Issuable. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(b), the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be 2,000,000 and shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock, shares of Stock purchased on the open market, or any combination thereof. If an outstanding Purchase Right for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of that Purchase Right shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. 
(b)    Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company and the requirements of Section 424 of the Code to the extent applicable, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off,spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting regular, periodic cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan, the limit on the shares which may be purchased by any Participant during an Offering (as described in Sections 8(a) and 8(b)) and each Purchase Right, and in the Purchase Price in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company." If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Purchase Rights are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to a Change of Control) shares of another corporation (the "New Shares"), the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Purchase Rights to provide that such Purchase Rights are for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise price per share of, the outstanding Purchase Rights shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Committee, in its discretion. Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the Purchase Price be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Purchase Right. The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  ELIGIBILITY.  
[END TABLE]

(iii)    Any Employee who is customarily employed by the Participating Company Group for not more than five (5) months in any calendar year. 
(b)    Exclusion of Certain Stockholders. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Employee shall be treated as an Eligible Employee and granted a Purchase Right under the Plan if, immediately after such grant, the Employee would own, or hold options to purchase, stock of the Company or of any Parent or Subsidiary possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of such corporation, as determined in accordance with Section 423(b)(3) of the Code.

The Company shall determine in good faith and in the exercise of its discretion whether an individual has become or has ceased to be an Employee or an Eligible Employee and the effective date of such individual's attainment or termination of such status, as the case may be. For purposes of an individual's participation in or other rights, if any, under the Plan as of the time of the Company's determination of whether or not the individual is an Employee, all such determinations by the Company shall be final, binding and conclusive as to such rights, if any, notwithstanding that the Company or any court of law or governmental agency subsequently makes a contrary determination as to such individual's status as an Employee. In addition, the Administrator may, for Offering Periods that have not yet commenced, establish additional eligibility requirements not inconsistent with Section 423. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.  OFFERINGS.  
[END TABLE]
The Plan shall be implemented by sequential Offerings of approximately six (6) months duration or such other duration as the Committee shall determine.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may establish additional or alternative concurrent, sequential or overlapping Offering Periods, a different duration for one or more Offering Periods or different commencing or ending dates for such Offering Periods; provided, however, that no Offering Period may have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. If the Committee shall so determine in its discretion, each Offering Period may consist of two (2) or more consecutive Purchase Periods having such duration as the Committee shall specify, and the last day of each such Purchase Period shall be a Purchase Date. If the first or last day of an Offering Period or a Purchase Period is not a Business Day, the Company shall specify the Business Day that will be deemed the first or last day, as the case may be, of the Offering Period or Purchase Period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

An Eligible Employee may become a Participant in an Offering Period by delivering a properly completed written or electronic Subscription Agreement to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including the Administrator) not later than the close of business on the Subscription Date established by the Company for that Offering Period. An Eligible Employee who does not deliver a properly completed Subscription Agreement in the manner permitted or required on or before the Subscription Date for an Offering Period shall not participate in the Plan for that Offering Period or for any subsequent Offering Period unless the Eligible Employee subsequently delivers a properly completed Subscription Agreement to the appropriate Company office or representative on or before the Subscription Date for such subsequent Offering Period. An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Offering Date of an Offering Period shall not be eligible to participate in that Offering Period but may participate in any subsequent Offering Period provided the Employee is still an Eligible Employee as of the Offering Date of such subsequent Offering Period. 
(b)    Continued Participation. A Participant shall automatically participate in the next Offering Period commencing immediately after the final Purchase Date of each Offering Period in which the Participant participates provided that the Participant remains an Eligible Employee on the Offering Date of the new Offering Period and has not either (i) withdrawn from the Plan pursuant to Section 12(a), or (ii) terminated employment or otherwise ceased to be an Eligible Employee as provided in Section 13. A Participant who may automatically participate in a subsequent Offering Period, as provided in this Section, is not required to deliver any additional Subscription Agreement for the subsequent Offering Period in order to continue participation in the Plan.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  8.  RIGHT TO PURCHASE SHARES.   
[END TABLE]
(a)    Grant of Purchase Right. Except as otherwise provided below, on the Offering Date of each Offering Period, each Participant in such Offering Period shall be granted automatically a Purchase Right consisting of an option to purchase the lesser of (i) that number of whole shares of Stock determined by dividing the Dollar Limit (determined as provided below) by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on such Offering Date or (ii) the Share Limit (determined as provided below). The Committee may, in its discretion and prior to the Offering Date of any Offering Period, (A) change the method of, or any of the foregoing factors in, determining the number of shares of Stock subject to Purchase Rights to be granted on such Offering Date, or (B) specify a maximum aggregate number of shares that may be purchased by all Participants in an Offering or on any Purchase Date within an Offering Period. No Purchase Right shall be granted on an Offering Date to any person who is not, on such Offering Date, an Eligible Employee. For the purposes of this Section, the "Dollar Limit" shall be determined by multiplying $2,083.33 by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the Offering Period and rounding to the nearest whole dollar, and the "Share Limit" shall be determined by multiplying two hundred and eight (208) shares by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the Offering Period and rounding to the nearest whole share. The Share Limit may be adjusted by the Committee prior to the start of an Offering Period. 
(b)    Calendar Year Purchase Limitation. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant shall be granted a Purchase Right which permits his or her right to purchase shares of Stock under the Plan to accrue at a rate which, when aggregated with such Participant's rights to purchase shares under all other employee stock purchase plans of a Participating Company intended to meet the requirements of Section 423, exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in Fair Market Value (or such other limit, if any, as may be imposed by the Code) for each calendar year in which such Purchase Right is outstanding at any time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Fair Market Value of shares purchased during a given Offering Period shall be determined as of the Offering Date for such Offering Period. The limitation described in this Section shall be applied in conformance with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  9.  PURCHASE PRICE.  
[END TABLE]
The Purchase Price at which each share of Stock may be acquired in an Offering Period upon the exercise of all or any portion of a Purchase Right shall be established by the Committee; provided, however, that the Purchase Price on each Purchase Date shall not be less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Offering Date of the Offering Period or (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Purchase Date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  10.  ACCUMULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION.  
[END TABLE]
Except as provided in Section 11(a)(ii) with respect to a Non-United States Offering, shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of all or any portion of a Purchase Right may be paid for only by means of payroll deductions from the Participant's Compensation accumulated during the Offering Period for which such Purchase Right was granted, subject to the following: 
(a)    Amount of Payroll Deductions. Except as otherwise provided herein, the amount to be deducted under the Plan from a Participant's Compensation on each pay day during an Offering Period shall be determined by the Participant's Subscription Agreement. For Non-United States Offerings, a Participant's payroll deduction from his or her Compensation will be in the applicable local currency and will be converted into United States dollars based upon the exchange rate in effect on the Purchase Date. The Subscription Agreement shall set forth the percentage or dollar amount of the Participant's Compensation to be deducted on each pay day during an Offering Period in whole percentages or dollars equivalent to not less than one percent (1%) (except as a result of an election pursuant to Section 10(c) to stop payroll deductions effective following the first pay day during an Offering) or more than fifteen percent (15%). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant's payroll deductions   for each calendar year may not exceed Twenty-One Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($21,250) in Fair Market Value. The Committee may change the foregoing limits on payroll deductions effective as of any Offering Date. 
(b)    Commencement of Payroll Deductions. Payroll deductions shall commence on the first pay day following the Offering Date and shall continue to the end of the Offering Period unless sooner cancelled or terminated as provided herein. 
(c)    Election Stop Payroll Deductions. During an Offering Period, a Participant may elect to stop deductions from his or her Compensation by delivering to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including the Administrator) a cancellation notice in accordance with the procedures prescribed by, and in a form acceptable to, the Company. To be effective with respect to an upcoming Purchase Date, such cancellation notice must be delivered not later than ten (10) Business Days prior to such Purchase Date. Upon such cancellation, the balance in the Participant's Plan account will be returned to the Participant, without interest, as soon as administratively practicable thereafter. 
(d)    Administrative Suspension of Payroll Deductions. The Company may, in its discretion, suspend a Participant's payroll deductions under the Plan as the Company deems advisable to avoid accumulating payroll deductions in excess of the amount that could reasonably be anticipated to purchase the maximum number of shares of Stock permitted (i) under the Participant's Purchase Right, or (ii) during a calendar year under the limit set forth in Section 8(b). Unless the Participant has either withdrawn from the Plan as provided in Section 12(a) or has ceased to be an Eligible Employee, suspended payroll deductions shall be resumed at the rate specified in the Participant's then effective Subscription Agreement either (A) at the beginning of the next Offering Period if the reason for suspension was clause (i) in the preceding sentence, or (B) at the beginning of the next Offering Period having a first Purchase Date that falls within the subsequent calendar year if the reason for suspension was clause (ii) in the preceding sentence. 
(e)    Participant Accounts. Individual bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained for each Participant. All payroll deductions from a Participant's Compensation (and other amounts received from a non-United States Participant pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) shall be credited to such Participant's Plan account and shall be deposited with the general funds of the Company unless otherwise required by applicable law. All such amounts received or held by the Company may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose. 
(f)    No Interest Paid. Interest shall not be paid on sums deducted from a Participant's Compensation pursuant to the Plan or otherwise credited to the Participant's Plan account unless otherwise required by applicable law.

  11.  PURCHASE OF SHARES.   
[END TABLE]
(a)    Exercise of Purchase Right. 
(i)    Generally. Except as provided in Section 11(a)(ii), on each Purchase Date of an Offering Period, each Participant who has not withdrawn from the Plan and whose participation in the Offering has not otherwise terminated before such Purchase Date shall automatically acquire pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right the number of whole shares of Stock determined by dividing (a) the total amount of the Participant's payroll deductions accumulated in the Participant's Plan account during the Offering Period and not previously applied toward the purchase of Stock by (b) the Purchase Price. However, in no event shall the number of shares purchased by the Participant during an Offering Period exceed the number of shares subject to the Participant's Purchase Right. No shares of Stock shall be purchased on a Purchase Date on behalf of a Participant whose participation in the Offering or the Plan has terminated before such Purchase Date. 
(ii)    Purchase by Non-United States Participants for Whom Payroll Deductions Are Prohibited by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding Section 11(a)(i), where payroll deductions on behalf of   Participants who are citizens or residents of countries other than the United States (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens) are prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may establish a separate Offering (a "Non-United States Offering") covering all Eligible Employees of one or more Participating Companies subject to such prohibition on payroll deductions. The Non-United States Offering shall provide another method for payment of the Purchase Price with such terms and conditions as shall be administratively convenient and comply with applicable law. On each Purchase Date of the Offering Period applicable to a Non-United States Offering, each Participant who has not withdrawn from the Plan and whose participation in such Offering Period has not otherwise terminated before such Purchase Date shall automatically acquire pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right a number of whole shares of Stock determined in accordance with Section 11(a)(i) to the extent of the total amount of the Participant's Plan account balance accumulated during the Offering Period in accordance with the method established by the Committee and not previously applied toward the purchase of Stock. However, in no event shall the number of shares purchased by a Participant during such Offering Period exceed the number of shares subject to the Participant's Purchase Right. The Company shall refund to a Participant in a Non-United States Offering in accordance with Section 11(d) any excess Purchase Price payment received from such Participant. 
(b)    Pro Rata Allocation of Shares. If the number of shares of Stock which might be purchased by all Participants on a Purchase Date exceeds the number of shares of Stock available in the Plan as provided in Section 4(a) or the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be purchased on such Purchase Date pursuant to a limit established by the Committee pursuant to Section 8(a), the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares available in as uniform a manner as practicable and as the Company determines to be equitable. Any fractional share resulting from such pro rata allocation to any Participant shall be disregarded. 
(c)    Delivery of Title to Shares. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after each Purchase Date, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued to or for the benefit of each Participant the shares of Stock acquired by the Participant on such Purchase Date by means of one or more of the following: (i) by delivering to the Participant evidence of book entry shares of Stock credited to the account of the Participant, (ii) by depositing such shares of Stock for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship, or (iii) by delivering such shares of Stock to the Participant in certificate form. 
(d)    Return of Plan Account Balance. Any cash balance remaining in a Participant's Plan account following any Purchase Date shall be refunded to the Participant as soon as practicable after such Purchase Date. However, if the cash balance to be returned to a Participant pursuant to the preceding sentence is less than the amount that would have been necessary to purchase an additional whole share of Stock on such Purchase Date, the Company may retain the cash balance in the Participant's Plan account to be applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock in the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering Period. 
(e)    Tax Withholding. At the time a Participant's Purchase Right is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a Participant disposes of some or all of the shares of Stock he or she acquires under the Plan, the Participant shall make adequate provision for the federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including social insurance), if any, required to be withheld by any Participating Company upon exercise of the Purchase Right or upon such disposition of shares, respectively. A Participating Company may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's compensation the amount necessary to meet such withholding obligations. 
(f)    Expiration of Purchase Right. Any portion of a Participant's Purchase Right remaining unexercised after the end of the Offering Period to which the Purchase Right relates shall expire immediately upon the end of the Offering Period. 
(g)    Provision of Reports and Stockholder Information to Participants. Each Participant who has exercised all or part of his or her Purchase Right shall receive, as soon as practicable after the Purchase Date, a report of such Participant's Plan account setting forth the total amount credited to his or her Plan account prior to   such exercise, the number of shares of Stock purchased, the Purchase Price for such shares, the date of purchase and the cash balance, if any, remaining immediately after such purchase that is to be refunded or retained in the Participant's Plan account pursuant to Section 11(d). The report required by this Section may be delivered in such form and by such means, including by electronic transmission, as the Company may determine. In addition, each Participant shall be provided information concerning the Company equivalent to that information provided generally to the Company's common stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  12.  WITHDRAWAL FROM PLAN.   
[END TABLE]
(a)    Voluntary Withdrawal from the Plan. A Participant may withdraw from the Plan by signing and delivering to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including the Administrator) a written or electronic notice of withdrawal on a form provided by the Company for this purpose. Such withdrawal may be elected at any time prior to the end of an Offering Period; provided, however, that if a Participant withdraws from the Plan after a Purchase Date, the withdrawal shall not affect shares of Stock acquired by the Participant on such Purchase Date. A Participant who voluntarily withdraws from the Plan is prohibited from resuming participation in the Plan in the same Offering from which he or she withdrew, but may participate in any subsequent Offering by again satisfying the requirements of Sections 5 and 7(a). The Company may impose, from time to time, a requirement that the notice of withdrawal from the Plan be on file with the Company office or representative designated by the Company for a reasonable period prior to the effectiveness of the Participant's withdrawal. 
(b)    Return of Plan Account Balance. Upon a Participant's voluntary withdrawal from the Plan pursuant to Section 12(a), the Participant's accumulated Plan account balance which has not been applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock shall be refunded to the Participant as soon as practicable after the withdrawal, without the payment of any interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law), and the Participant's interest in the Plan and the Offering shall terminate. Such amounts to be refunded in accordance with this Section may not be applied to any other Offering under the Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  13.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR  ELIGIBILITY.  
[END TABLE]
Upon a Participant's ceasing, prior to a Purchase Date, to be an Employee of the Participating Company Group for any reason, including retirement, disability or death, or upon the failure of a Participant to remain an Eligible Employee, the Participant's participation in the Plan shall terminate immediately. In such event, the Participant's Plan account balance which has not been applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock shall, as soon as practicable, be returned to the Participant or, in the case of the Participant's death, to the Participant's beneficiary designated in accordance with Section 20, if any, or legal representative, and all of the Participant's rights under the Plan shall terminate. Interest shall not be paid on sums returned pursuant to this Section 13 unless otherwise required by applicable law. A Participant whose participation has been so terminated may again become eligible to participate in the Plan by satisfying the requirements of Sections 5 and 7(a). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  14.  EFFECT OF CHANGE OF CONTROL ON PURCHASE RIGHTS.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of a Change of Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiring Corporation"), may, without the consent of any Participant, assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Purchase Rights or substitute substantially equivalent purchase rights for the Acquiring Corporation's stock. If the Acquiring Corporation elects not to assume, continue or substitute for the outstanding Purchase Rights, the Purchase Date of the then current Offering Period shall be accelerated to a date before the date of the Change of Control specified by the Committee, but the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Purchase Rights shall not be adjusted. All Purchase Rights which are neither assumed or continued by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change of Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change of Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change of Control.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  15.  NONTRANSFERABILITY OF PURCHASE  RIGHTS.  
[END TABLE]
Neither payroll deductions or other amounts credited to a Participant's Plan account nor a Participant's Purchase Right may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any manner other than as provided by the Plan or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. (A beneficiary designation pursuant to Section 20 shall not be treated as a disposition for this purpose.) Any such attempted assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw from the Plan as provided in Section 12(a). A Purchase Right shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  16.  COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES  LAW.  
[END TABLE]
The issuance of shares under the Plan shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities. A Purchase Right may not be exercised if the issuance of shares upon such exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any securities exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Purchase Right may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Purchase Right be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Right, or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Right may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under the Plan shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of a Purchase Right, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation, and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  17.  RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER AND  EMPLOYEE.  
[END TABLE]
A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder by virtue of the Participant's participation in the Plan until the date of the issuance of the shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4(b). Nothing herein shall confer upon a Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Participating Company Group or interfere in any way with any right of the Participating Company Group to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  18.  NOTIFICATION OF DISPOSITION OF  SHARES.  
[END TABLE]
The Company may require the Participant to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares of Stock acquired by exercise of a Purchase Right. The Company may require that until such time as a Participant disposes of shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of a Purchase Right, the Participant shall hold all such shares in the Participant's name until the later of two years after the date of grant of such Purchase Right or one year after the date of exercise of such Purchase Right. The Company may direct that the certificates evidencing shares of Stock acquired by exercise of a Purchase Right refer to such requirement to give prompt notice of disposition. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  19.  LEGENDS.  
[END TABLE]
The Company may at any time place legends or other identifying symbols referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions or any provision convenient in the administration of the Plan   on some or all of the certificates representing shares of Stock issued under the Plan. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to a Purchase Right in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, legends placed on such certificates may include, but shall not be limited to the following: 
"THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED BY THE CORPORATION TO THE REGISTERED HOLDER UPON THE PURCHASE OF SHARES UNDER AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AS DEFINED IN SECTION 423 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. THE TRANSFER AGENT FOR THE SHARES EVIDENCED HEREBY SHALL NOTIFY THE CORPORATION IMMEDIATELY OF ANY TRANSFER OF THE SHARES BY THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF. THE REGISTERED HOLDER SHALL HOLD ALL SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PLAN IN THE REGISTERED HOLDER'S NAME (AND NOT IN THE NAME OF ANY NOMINEE)." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  20.  DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.   
[END TABLE]
(a)    Designation Procedure. Subject to local laws and procedures, a Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive (i) shares and cash, if any, from the Participant's Plan account if the Participant dies subsequent to a Purchase Date but prior to delivery to the Participant of such shares and cash, or (ii) cash, if any, from the Participant's Plan account if the Participant dies prior to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse. A Participant may change his or her beneficiary designation at any time by written notice to the Company. 
(b)    Absence of Beneficiary Designation. If a Participant dies without an effective designation pursuant to Section 20(a) of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company shall deliver any shares or cash credited to the Participant's Plan account to the Participant's legal representative or as otherwise required by applicable law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  21.  NOTICES.  
[END TABLE]
All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  22.  GOVERNING LAW.  
[END TABLE]
The Plan will be governed by and interpreted consistently with the laws of the State of Delaware, except as may be necessary to comply with applicable requirements of federal law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  23.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.  
[END TABLE]
(a)    The Committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, except that (a) no such amendment, suspension or termination shall affect Purchase Rights previously granted under the Plan unless expressly provided by the Committee, and (b) no such amendment, suspension or termination may materially adversely affect a Purchase Right previously granted under the Plan without the consent of the Participant, except to the extent permitted by the Plan or as may be necessary to qualify the Plan as an employee stock purchase plan pursuant to Section 423 or to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. In addition, an amendment to the Plan must be approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months of the adoption of such amendment if such amendment would authorize the sale of more shares than are then authorized for issuance under the Plan or would change the definition of the corporations that may be designated by the Committee as Participating Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Committee   determines that continuation of the Plan or an Offering would result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences to the Company, the Committee may, in its discretion and without the consent of any Participant, including with respect to an Offering Period then in progress: (i) terminate the Plan or any Offering Period, (ii) accelerate the Purchase Date of any Offering Period, (iii) reduce the discount or the method of determining the Purchase Price in any Offering Period (e.g., by determining the Purchase Price solely on the basis of the Fair Market Value on the Purchase Date), (iv) reduce the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be purchased in any Offering Period, or (v) take any combination of the foregoing actions.
