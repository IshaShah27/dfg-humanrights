Corporate Governance 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ENERGIZER'S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board regularly considers the appropriate leadership structure for the Company and has concluded that the Company and its shareholders are best served by not having a formal policy on whether the same individual should serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. This flexibility allows the Board to utilize its considerable experience and knowledge to elect the most qualified director as Chairman of the Board, while maintaining the ability to separate the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles when appropriate. Currently, we have an Independent Chairman of the Board who is appointed annually by the independent directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer have been separate since 2015. Our Chief Executive Officer has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, while our Independent Chairman facilitates our Board's independent oversight of management.

Corporate Governance 
COMMITTEE COMPOSITION 
The Company's Corporate Governance Principles and all of the Board Committee charters are available on the Company's website, www.energizerholdings.com if you click on "Investors," then "Corporate Governance", then "Overview". 
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
One of the Board's primary responsibilities is to oversee the development of appropriate executive-level talent to successfully execute the Company's strategy. Management succession is regularly discussed by the independent directors in executive session and with the Chief Executive Officer. The Board reviews candidates for all senior executive positions to confirm that qualified successor-candidates are available for all positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of successor-candidates. 
Our Independent Chairman oversees the process for the Chief Executive Officer succession and leads, at least annually, the Board's discussion of Chief Executive Officer succession planning. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews with the Board development plans for successors of the other executive officer roles. Directors engage with potential Chief Executive Officer and senior management talent at Board and Committee meetings and in less formal settings to enable directors to personally assess candidates. The Board reviews management succession in the ordinary course of business as well as contingency planning. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE ASSESSMENT 
The Board and each Committee conducts an annual self-evaluation to assess effectiveness and consider opportunities for improvement. The self-evaluation process is managed by the Human Capital Committee. The Independent Chairman of the Board as well as each Committee Chair leads the Board and Committee in a robust assessment on an annual basis. 
Matters considered in the self-evaluation include the following:

The risk oversight responsibility of the Board and its Committees is enabled by management evaluation and reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment and management of critical risks and management's risk mitigation strategies as well as compliance matters. Management of day-to-day operational, financial and legal risks and compliance issues is the responsibility of operational and executive leadership of the Company.

      The Company has established a comprehensive  risk management process that is primarily managed by two risk committees, the Executive Compliance and Risk Committee (the "Executive Risk Committee") and the Compliance and Risk Subcommittee (the "Risk Subcommittee"). Each  committee is sponsored by our Chief Financial Officer, and co-led by our Chief Compliance Officer and our Vice President, Internal Audit.   Executive Risk Committee   The Executive Risk Committee is made up of members of the executive management  team, and sets the tone and direction for the risk management program. The Executive Risk Committee provides oversight to the risk management process, ensures adequate focus on high priority risks, reviews Risk Subcommittee reports, and receives  updates on significant compliance investigations worldwide. The committee co-leads meet annually with Executive Risk Committee members who are high priority risk owners in order to discuss the identified risks  and ensure appropriate mitigation actions are being taken.   The  Executive Risk Committee reports directly to the Audit Committee and advises the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis regarding the Company's risk management structure and practices, as well as management's programs to identify, assess,  manage, and mitigate significant enterprise risks of the Company.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Our approach to corporate responsibility all boils down to one simple thought: "Do the right thing", and we have developed a three-part approach to execute. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                First is a focus on reducing the impact our Company and products have on the environment. Through various efforts  including product development, packaging, recycling and outreach programs, we are careful to make choices with environmental benefit in mind.

Board of Directors 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION 
The Human Capital Committee is responsible for recommending candidates for election to our Board of Directors, consistent with the requirements for membership set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles. 
In fiscal 2018, the Human Capital Committee continued to identify director candidates through the use of an external search firm. Ms. Rimmer was identified by an external search firm for inclusion as a director candidate and was appointed to the Board, following the Human Capital Committee's evaluation and nomination. The Human Capital Committee also considers candidates proposed by directors, management, and our shareholders. 
The Human Capital Committee also considers shareholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of Directors using the same criteria described below. Additional information can be found in the section "Shareholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting". 
At the 2017 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the shareholders voted to amend and restate the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company that resulted in a phased-in elimination of the classified board. Our Board of Directors currently consists of two (2) classes: one class consisting of two (2) directors whose terms of service expire at the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and one class consisting of nine (9) directors whose terms of service expire at the 2019 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Beginning with the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, our shareholders will be electing all Board members on an annual basis. 
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS 
The Human Capital Committee works with our Board to determine the characteristics, skills, and experience for the Board with the objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experience. 
For all directors, we require independence, integrity, energy, forthrightness, analytical skills and commitment to devote the necessary time and attention to the Company's affairs. In evaluating the suitability of individual director candidates, our Board considers many factors, including educational and professional background; personal accomplishments; industry experience; and diversity on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion, disability and sexual orientation. 
Directors should be able to devote sufficient time to the affairs of the Company and be diligent in fulfilling the responsibilities of a director and Board Committee member, including developing and maintaining sufficient knowledge of the Company and its industries; reviewing and analyzing reports and other information important to the Board and Committee responsibilities; preparing for, attending and participating in Board and Committee meetings; and satisfying appropriate orientation guidelines. 
The Human Capital Committee is also responsible for articulating and refining specific criteria for Board and Committee membership to supplement the more general criteria. 
Mr. Mulcahy, who is currently 74, has been a director on our Board since 2015 and was unanimously appointed by the independent directors to serve as the Independent Chairman of our Board from 2015 until 2018. During Mr. Mulcahy's service, he has continued to enhance the Board's oversight of management, given his extensive experience of the industry and the Company, and has provided an invaluable perspective for both the Board and management. Although Mr. Mulcahy has reached the retirement age set forth within our Corporate Governance Principles, the Board has requested that Mr. Mulcahy stand for nomination for re-election to our Board at our 2019 Annual Shareholders' Meeting to provide continuity and a smooth transition of the Chairman role, and Mr. Mulcahy has accepted this request.

Board of Directors 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Having an independent board is a critical element of our corporate governance. Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that a majority of our directors be independent. Our Board has adopted director independence guidelines to assist in determining each director's independence. The guidelines either meet or exceed the independence requirements of the NYSE. 
Each year and before a new director is appointed, the Board must affirmatively determine a director has no relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. Annually, each director completes a detailed questionnaire that provides information about relationships that might affect the determination of independence. Management provides the Human Capital Committee and Board with relevant known facts and circumstances of any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee. The Human Capital Committee then completes an assessment of each director, considering all known relevant facts and circumstances concerning any relationship bearing on the independence of a director or nominee. This process includes evaluating whether any identified relationship otherwise adversely affects a director's independence and affirmatively determining that the director has no material relationship with the Company, another director, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. 
Based on the review and recommendation by the Human Capital Committee, the Board analyzed the independence of each director and determined that all nominees with the exception of Mr. Hoskins, our President and Chief Executive Officer, meet the standards of independence under our Corporate Governance Principles.

Board of Directors 
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE 
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE 
Our Board holds regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. Additionally, there is generally an annual strategy retreat, which includes presentations and discussions with senior management about the Company's long-term strategy. During fiscal 2018, all directors attended 75% or more of the Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which they served during their period of service. Under our Corporate Governance Principles, each director is encouraged to attend our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. All of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ENERGIZER'S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE — DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
We provided several elements of compensation to our non-employee directors for service on our Board during fiscal 2018. The Human Capital Committee, which makes recommendations to the full Board regarding director compensation, strives to set director compensation at the 50th percentile of the peer group. This peer group, which can be found under "Executive Compensation—Executive Compensation Peer Group," has been selected for purposes of evaluating our executive compensation based on market data provided by the Human Capital Committee's independent consultant, Mercer. 
Retainers and Meeting Fees 
During fiscal 2018, all the directors, other than Mr. Hoskins and Ms. Rimmer, received the following compensation package for serving on the Board and its Committees. Mr. Hoskins, our President and Chief Executive Officer, receives no additional compensation for his service on the Board and its Committees. During fiscal 2018, Ms. Rimmer received a pro rata portion of the below compensation package, as Ms. Rimmer joined our Board and our Audit Committee, effective July 27, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual retainer   $ 100,000   
 Fee for each Board meeting in excess of six (6) meetings   $ 1,500   
 Fee for each Committee meeting in excess of six (6) meetings   $ 1,500   
[END TABLE]
The Chairs of the Committees also received an additional annual retainer of $20,000 for their service, and the Independent Chairman of the Board received an additional annual retainer of $100,000 for his service as Chairman. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Non-management directors are permitted to defer all or a portion of their retainers and fees under the terms of our deferred compensation plan. Deferrals may be made into (a) the Energizer common stock unit fund, which tracks the value of our common stock; or (b) the prime rate option under which deferrals are credited with interest at the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal. Deferrals in the deferred compensation plan are currently paid out in a lump sum in cash or Energizer stock within 60 days following the director's termination of service on the Board. 
Restricted Stock Equivalents 
Initial Grant.    New, non-management directors that may be appointed or elected to the Board receive a grant of restricted stock equivalents with a grant-date value of $200,000, which vest three years from the date of grant or upon certain other vesting events. Directors have the option to defer delivery of shares upon vesting of this award until retirement from the Board.

Executive Compensation 
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our executive compensation program provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align executive officer and shareholder interests. We consider our executive pay program to be instrumental in helping us achieve our business objectives and effective in rewarding our executive officers for their role in achieving strong financial and operational performance. The Human Capital Committee has primary responsibility for approving our compensation strategy and philosophy and the compensation programs applicable to our executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation program design has been consistent for more than three years and has received positive support each  year from our shareholders since 2016  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay decisions are consistent with our pay for performance philosophy and fiscal 2018 Company performance

Say on Pay Results 
We conduct shareholder engagement throughout the year and provide shareholders with an opportunity to cast an annual, advisory Say on Pay vote. Our historical Say on Pay results influenced our decision to maintain a consistent approach to our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018. Last year, our shareholders overwhelmingly approved our executive compensation. The Human Capital Committee will continue to consider shareholder feedback and the outcome of Say on Pay vote results for future compensation decisions.

PAY FOR PERFORMANCE 
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE 
The Human Capital Committee allocates pay in a manner designed to place performance at the forefront of our overall executive compensation program. Our focus on pay for performance is best demonstrated through the structure of our executive compensation programs where the majority of executive pay is at risk and subject to annual and long-term performance requirements. 
Further, consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, as illustrated in the graph below, the Company's performance, with respect to total shareholder return over a three-year period was in the top third among the companies in our executive compensation peer group.

Compensation Philosophy 
The philosophy underlying our executive compensation program is simple, aligned and balanced. Equally important, we view compensation practices as a means for communicating our goals and standards of conduct and performance, and for motivating and rewarding colleagues in relation to their achievements. Overall, the same principles that govern the compensation of all our salaried colleagues apply to the compensation of our executive officers. Within this framework, we observe the following, guiding principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What we Believe           What We've Done         
Simple       Compensation methods should be transparent, link  between performance metrics and Company strategy should be clear and perquisites should be minimized           Used straightforward annual and long-term incentive plan  metrics that are directly tied to business performance      Froze pension accruals      Limited the use of all perquisites (<.001% of total  compensation for executive officers in fiscal 2018)

As of September 30, 2018, each of our executive officers was in compliance with the requirements.

Pay Evaluation and Decision Process 
Each year, the Human Capital Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, reviews our executive officers' performance using a balanced and disciplined approach to determine their base salaries and variable compensation awards. The approach for fiscal 2018 included a full-year assessment of financial results and progress delivering on our three strategic priorities. 
The Human Capital Committee considers various factors that collectively indicate successful management of our business, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company performance, including financial and non-financial measures   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The manner in which results are achieved, adherence to risk policies, and the quality of earnings

Annual Compensation-Related Risk Evaluation 
We monitor the risks associated with our compensation program on an ongoing basis. Our compensation risk assessment occurs in two parts: a review of the Company's compensation programs and a review of compensation decisions and payments, with a focus on our executive officers. In October 2018, with input from the Human Capital Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Human Capital Committee conducted a review of our compensation programs, including the executive compensation program, to assess the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices. The Human Capital Committee agreed with the review's findings that these risks were within our ability to effectively monitor and manage and that these compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, the Human Capital Committee determined that the following design features reduce the risk within our compensation policies and practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation program design provides a balanced mix of cash and equity, annual and longer-term incentives

Role of Independent Compensation Consultant 
To help determine executive pay, the Human Capital Committee retains an independent compensation consultant, Mercer, for advice regarding the general competitive landscape and trends in executive compensation. While the Human Capital Committee meets with the consultant from time to time, the Chair of the Human Capital Committee also communicates directly with the

 consultant between Human Capital Committee meetings. The independent compensation consultant advises the Human Capital Committee on several matters, including (1) competitive analysis (including in relation to our peer group), (2) incentive plan design, (3) updates on trends in executive and director compensation, (4) peer group composition, and (5) other compensation-related matters as requested by the Human Capital Committee. 
Executive Compensation Peer Groups 
The Human Capital Committee selects the members of our peer group and periodically examines whether peers continue to meet the criteria for inclusion described below. As part of this process, the Human Capital Committee receives advice from its independent compensation consultant and selects a peer group that includes companies that have the following characteristics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• US-based, publicly traded consumer packaged goods company with "brand  identity"

Chief Executive Officer Assessment, Compensation Process for Executive Officers and Annual Timeline 
Chief Executive Officer Assessment 
With respect to our Chief Executive Officer's pay, the Human Capital Committee conducts an annual performance assessment of the Chief Executive Officer and determines appropriate adjustments to all elements of his pay based on the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Individual Performance            Company Performance            Market Practices including analysis of his  performance against his performance goals approved by the Human Capital Committee; effectiveness of the Chief Executive Officer's leadership; and the Chief Executive Officer's experience             including returns to shareholders           as provided by the independent compensation consultant including analysis of his  performance against his performance goals approved by the Human Capital Committee; effectiveness of the Chief Executive Officer's leadership; and the Chief Executive Officer's experience             including returns to shareholders           as provided by the independent compensation consultant    
[END TABLE]
For the other executive officers, the Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Human Capital Committee for all elements of pay. These recommendations are based on an assessment of the individual's roles, responsibilities, experience and individual performance. The Human Capital Committee also obtains market data from its independent compensation consultant and then reviews, discusses, modifies, and approves, as appropriate, these recommendations.

We believe that compensation must be competitive in the marketplace for the role, internally consistent, and equitable in order to motivate our colleagues to deliver consistent and sustainable operating results for our shareholders. In fiscal 2018, the Human Capital Committee reviewed a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer pay to the median pay of all our colleagues other than the Chief Executive Officer. We estimate that the compensation for our Chief Executive Officer in fiscal 2018 was approximately 198 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our other colleagues. 
We identified our median colleague utilizing data as of July 1, 2018, by examining, for individuals employed by us as of that date, the (i) projected base or wage compensation, projected recurrent cash allowances, and actual cash bonus payments for

 permanent colleagues, and (ii) actual base or wage compensation, actual recurrent cash allowances, and actual cash bonus payments for temporary colleagues. We included approximately 4,051 colleagues, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. Under the de minimis exception to the Dodd-Frank Act reporting rules, we excluded 118 colleagues based in Malaysia and 62 colleagues based in the Philippines, which represented approximately 4.4% of the Company's total colleague population as of July 1, 2018. 
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies, including our compensation peer group, may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.

The Human Capital Committee believes these pay components align the interests of our executives and our shareholders by basing a significant portion of total pay on performance and achievement of our short- and long-term goals. The specific mix among the individual components reflects market comparisons (primarily with respect to the median of our peer group) and individual position and performance.

Executive Compensation 
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION 
Base Salary 
The general guideline for determining salary levels for our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, is to be around the 50th percentile of our executive compensation peer group, adjusted for other factors such as individual performance and responsibilities. While we are cognizant of the competitive range, our primary goal is to compensate our executive officers at a level that best achieves our compensation philosophy, whether or not this results in actual pay for some positions that may be higher or lower than the market median. The Human Capital Committee considers adjustments to base salaries for the executive officers on an annual basis. For fiscal 2018, the Human Capital Committee felt that an increase to the base salaries of our executive officers in line with the increases provided to our colleagues generally was reasonable in light of the Company's operating results in fiscal 2018. To remain competitive with the market, the Human Capital Committee also considered the effect of such increased salaries for our executive officers in relation to the median of our peer group. 
The table sets forth the base salaries for our named executive officers. The base salary adjustments for fiscal 2018 were effective December 1, 2017.

Annual Incentive Program 
The overall design of our fiscal 2018 annual incentive program was the same as the fiscal 2017 program. The annual incentive program is based on performance against certain metrics determined by the Human Capital Committee. Our fiscal 2018 annual incentive award was designed to measure performance against four metrics:

Actual achievement metrics vary from reported figures to address the impacts of currency and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. 
Each metric for the annual incentive plan was subject to adjustment for certain limited matters, including the effects of acquisitions, divestitures or recapitalizations, extraordinary transactions such as mergers or spin-offs, unusual or non-recurring non-cash accounting impacts, and variations in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and budget exchange rate. 
Bonuses increase proportionately in 1/10th of 1% increments for final results between the goals indicated with maximum bonus at stretch. No bonuses tied to performance are paid for results below the Threshold goal. The maximum bonus payout is capped at 200% for Company performance at, or above, the Stretch goal. 
Our Human Capital Committee recognized that the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was an unusual item and outside the influence of the officers. As a result, our Human Capital Committee exercised negative discretion to reduce our actual performance of our Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings per Share metrics to remove the positive effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

The performance goals for each metric were set at the beginning of the fiscal year, and each executive officer was assigned individual bonus targets based on individual performance and market practice information provided by the independent compensation consultant. For fiscal 2018, the following bonus targets, defined as a percentage of the individual's base pay, were assigned as follows:

Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the Human Capital Committee to grant various types of equity awards. The Human Capital Committee grants to key executives primarily restricted stock equivalent awards, with achievement of Company performance targets over three years as a condition to vesting of the majority of the award, and continued employment with the Company over the same period as a condition to vesting of the remainder of the award. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Change in Control". In November 2017, the Human Capital Committee awarded three-year incentive awards with a performance-based component constituting approximately 70% of the restricted stock equivalents vesting at Target achievement and a time-based component constituting approximately 30% of the award value at target of the award. 
Timing and Procedures for Grants in Fiscal 2018 
Other than in exceptional cases, such as promotions or new hires, long-term incentive awards are granted in the first quarter of the fiscal year (October through December), at the time when salary levels and bonus programs for the new fiscal year are also determined. 
The size of equity awards for our executive officers granted in November 2017 was based on several factors, including officers' individual performance, current dilution rates, market run-rate for equity grants among our peer group, and benchmark data from our peer group provided by our independent compensation consultant. 
Time-Based Restricted Stock Units 
The number of restricted stock equivalents awarded in November 2017 was based on the corresponding grant date value of the restricted stock equivalents. The restricted stock equivalent awards are stock-settled at the end of the three-year period, when they convert into unrestricted shares of our common stock if and to the extent that the vesting requirements are met. The number of restricted stock equivalents granted to each executive officer is shown in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table".

Long-Term Performance Awards 
In November 2017, the Human Capital Committee granted long-term equity incentive awards to our executive officers. These awards potentially vest in November 2020 based on the achievement of the following, two performance metrics.

The Human Capital Committee adopted performance metrics that use non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items that the Human Capital Committee believes are not reflective of the Company's ongoing operating performance, such as costs related to acquisition and integration costs, and gain on sale of real estate. The Human Capital Committee believes these performance metrics more accurately reflect Energizer's underlying financial and operating results. 
Each metric for the long-term incentive program is subject to adjustment for certain limited matters, including the effects of acquisitions, divestitures or recapitalizations, extraordinary transactions such as mergers or spin-offs, unusual or non-recurring non-cash accounting impacts, and variations in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and budget exchange rate. 
The number of units granted to each NEO is shown in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table". No vesting of performance based long-term incentive awards occurs for results below the Threshold goal, and the maximum bonus payout is capped at 200% for Company performance at, or above, Stretch performance. 
Value Provided to Shareholders 
Over the past three years, we have provided significant value to our shareholders, with total shareholder return of 56.4%. These results we achieved for our shareholders are consistent with the results obtained under our incentive plans. Similarly, the performance measures associated with those long-term performance incentive awards that were granted in 2015 were measured over a three-year vesting period and were tied to cumulative adjusted earnings per share and cumulative free cash flow as a percentage of adjusted net sales. The Company had outstanding results over the three-year vesting period. Based on these results, the long-term performance incentive grants paid out at 200% of target. 
OTHER PAY PRACTICES 
Executive Savings Investment Plan 
On July 1, 2015, we adopted an executive savings investment plan, our excess 401(k) plan, in which certain executive officers, including our NEOs, participate. Under the plan, amounts that would be contributed, either by an executive or by the Company on the executive's behalf, to the Company's qualified defined contribution plan (the "401(k) plan") but for limitations imposed by the IRS, will be credited to the non-qualified defined contribution executive savings investment plan. Details of the executive savings investment plan, including the contributions, earnings, and year-end balances, are set forth in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table". 
In fiscal 2017, we adopted an amendment to the Executive Savings Investment Plan, aligning this plan to the terms of our 401(k) plan by revising the four-year vesting schedule to immediate vesting of the Company match. This amendment, effective January 1, 2018, aligned the plan with market practice, facilitates ease in integrating plans in the event of a merger or acquisition, and reduces compliance requirements.

Executive Compensation 
OTHER PAY PRACTICES 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Our colleagues do not have the opportunity to defer portions of their salary and bonus compensation under the terms of our deferred compensation plan, or to invest in the Energizer common stock unit fund within the deferred compensation plan. However, certain executives who were employed at our former parent company prior to the Spin-Off had their account balances under our former parent company's deferred compensation plan transferred to our deferred compensation plan. Details of the deferred compensation program, including the contributions, earnings, and year-end balances, are set forth in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table". 
Pension Benefits 
Energizer established a new retirement plan that acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of our former parent's plans in connection with the Spin-Off. Prior to January 1, 2014, our former parent company's retirement plan covered essentially all U.S. employees of Energizer after they became eligible. Pension benefits are provided under a tax qualified defined benefit plan that is subject to maximum pay and benefit limits under the tax rules. Pension benefits are also provided under a pension restoration plan (the "Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan") that provides a supplement to an executive's pension benefit equal to the amount that the executive would have received but for the tax limitations. Details of pension benefits under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are set forth in the "Pension Benefits Table," including the accompanying narrative. As of December 31, 2013, which is the end of the first quarter of our former parent company's fiscal 2014, the plans were frozen and future retirement service benefits are no longer accrued under this retirement program. The freeze includes both the qualified and non-qualified plans. 
The Retirement Accumulation Account that was effective from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2013, included the future retirement benefits of the participants in our former parent company's qualified defined benefit pension plan, including the NEOs, which were determined in accordance with a retirement accumulation formula. The participants received monthly credits equal to 6% of their eligible benefit earnings for each month, which amounts were credited with monthly interest equal to the 30-year Treasury rate that is reset annually. Certain older, longer-tenured participants, including the NEOs with age and years of service totaling at least 60 but not more than 74 as of December 31, 2009 received an additional monthly credit equal to 2% of eligible benefit earnings. Participants receive credit for years of service with our former parent company. Other older, longer-tenured participants with age and years of service totaling 75 or more as of December 31, 2009 received an additional monthly credit equal to 4% of their eligible benefit earnings. These transition credits were available to eligible plan participants through 2013 (or, if earlier, their termination of employment with the Company). 
The defined benefit plan has used the following other benefit calculation formulas, all of which have been frozen as of the end of calendar year 2009: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pension Equity ("PEP") benefit formula. Under PEP, an executive is entitled to a benefit (payable in lump sum  or as a monthly annuity) based on five-year average annual earnings, which were multiplied by "pension equity credits" earned with years of service. The benefit was subject to a three-year vesting period. PEP was applied to  Mr. Hoskins.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PensionPlus Match Account ("PPMA"). The PPMA generally provided a 325% match under our retirement plan to  those participants who made an after-tax contribution of 1% of their annual earnings to our 401(k) plan. To the extent an officer's PPMA benefit was unavailable due to the IRC limits, the benefit was  restored under our excess savings investment plan and not the pension restoration plan for executives. The benefit was generally subject to a three-year vesting requirement. The PPMA benefit was available through the end of the calendar year 2009  for Mr. Hoskins.  
[END TABLE]
Severance and Other Benefits Following a Change of Control 
We have not entered into employment agreements with our executives. However, the Human Capital Committee approved an executive severance plan and change of control agreements with each of our executive officers, as discussed under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control" to align with the market practice of using pre-defined termination programs for NEOs.

Executive Compensation 
OTHER PAY PRACTICES 
The change of control agreements are designed to provide executives with increased security in the event of a change of control. The Human Capital Committee annually reviews the cost and the terms of the agreements with input provided by Mercer. We believe that the retention value provided by the agreements, and the benefit to us when the executive is provided the opportunity to focus on the interests of shareholders and not the executive's own personal financial interests, outweighs the potential cost, given that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such protections are common among companies of our size, and allow us to offer a competitive compensation package;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such costs will be triggered only if the new controlling entity involuntarily terminates the impacted executives, or the  executives resign for good reason, during the protected period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the agreements include non-compete and  non-solicitation covenants binding on the executives, which can provide significant considerations to completion of a potential transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the individuals with the agreements are carefully selected by the Board of Directors, and we believe they are critical  to the process of evaluating or negotiating a potential change of control transaction or in the operation of our business during the negotiations or integration process, so that their retention would be critical to the success of any such  transaction.  
[END TABLE]
We do not permit tax gross-up payments relating to severance payments for change of control employment agreements entered into with our executive officers. 
A description of the projected cost, if a change of control were to have occurred on the last day of fiscal 2018 and all of the NEOs were terminated on that date, is provided under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control". 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
Prior to 2018, a public company was limited by the Internal Revenue Code to a $1 million deduction for compensation paid to its Chief Executive Officer or any of its three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the Chief Financial Officer) who were employed at year-end. This limitation did not apply to compensation that met the tax code requirements for qualifying performance-based compensation. Changes in tax law effective January 1, 2018 limit a public company's deductions to $1 million for compensation paid to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and each of its three other most highly compensated executive officers, as well as to any individual who was subject to the $1 million deduction limitation in 2017 or any later year. 
Under the revised law, there is no exception for qualifying performance-based compensation unless it is pursuant to a written binding contract in effect as of November 2, 2017. Certain incentive awards made on or prior to November 2, 2017 may satisfy the requirements for deductible compensation. The Human Capital Committee's policy is to maximize the tax deductibility of executive compensation without compromising the essential framework of the existing total compensation program. The Human Capital Committee continues to retain the discretion to make awards and pay amounts that do not qualify as deductible. 
Perquisites 
We offer a limited number of perquisites for our executive officers. The primary perquisite or executive benefit consists of the executive financial planning program, which provides reimbursement for 80% of the costs incurred for qualifying financial planning, legal, and tax preparation services up to a maximum of $8,000 in the first calendar year and $6,000 in subsequent calendar years. This benefit partially offsets costs incurred by our executive officers in connection with their regulatory compliance obligations as public company executives. We regularly review the benefits provided to our executives and make appropriate modifications based on peer group analysis and the Human Capital Committee's evaluation of the retentive value of these benefits. 
Success Incentive Agreement 
In connection with Mr. Gorman's appointment as Interim Chief Financial Officer on June 8, 2017, the Human Capital Committee approved the Company's entry into a Success Incentive Agreement with Mr. Gorman to provide an incentive for Mr. Gorman to

OTHER PAY PRACTICES 
 assist in the successful transition of the Company during the interim period prior to hiring a permanent Chief Financial Officer. The Success Incentive Agreement provided that upon a successful transition, Mr. Gorman would be entitled to receive a special cash bonus equal to $240,000 on February 1, 2018. Mr. Gorman received the Success Incentive cash bonus on February 1, 2018. 
Clawback Policy 
Under our annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards, in the event of a restatement of financial results to correct a material error, the Human Capital Committee is authorized to reduce or recoup an executive officer's award, as applicable, to the extent that the Human Capital Committee determines such executive officer's misconduct was a significant contributing factor to the need for a restatement. 
Trading in Energizer Stock 
Under our insider trading policy, directors, officers and employees or their designees are prohibited from engaging in speculative trading, hedging or pledging transactions in Energizer securities, including prohibitions on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• investing or trading in market-traded options on Energizer securities—i.e., puts and calls;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange  funds) that are designed to profit from, hedge or offset any change in the market value of equity securities (1) granted to the director, officer or employee by Energizer as part of the compensation of the employee or member of the Board of  Directors; or (2) held, directly or indirectly, by the director, officer or employee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• purchasing Energizer securities on margin, pledging Energizer securities, or holding Energizer securities in margin  accounts;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• engaging in "short-sales" of Energizer securities—i.e., selling Energizer stock not owned at the time of  the sale; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• speculating on relatively short-term price movements of Energizer securities—i.e., engage in a purchase and sale of  Energizer stock within a short period of time.  
[END TABLE]
The policy prohibits the transfer of funds into or out of Energizer stock equivalent funds in Energizer's benefit plans while in possession or aware of material non-public information, or engaging in any other transaction involving Energizer securities, including pledging, that suggests the misuse of information that is unavailable to the general public.

Balances in the plan are vested and may be paid out in a lump sum in cash six months following termination, or in five-or ten-year increments commencing the year following termination of employment, as previously elected by the participant. 
Executive Savings Investment Plan — Under the terms of our executive savings investment plan, our excess 401(k) plan, amounts that would be contributed, either by an executive or by us on the executive's behalf, to the 401(k) plan but for limitations imposed by the IRC, are credited to the non-qualified executive savings investment plan. Under that plan, executives may elect to defer their contributions into any of the measurement fund options which track the performance of the Vanguard investment funds offered under our qualified savings investment plan. Deferrals and vested Company contributions may be transferred to different investment options at the executive's discretion. Deferrals in the executive savings investment plan, adjusted for the net investment return, are paid out in a lump sum payment, or in five or ten annual installments, following retirement or other termination of employment, as previously elected by the participant.

Executive Compensation 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLE 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
We have not entered into general employment agreements with any of our NEOs. We have adopted an executive severance plan providing for certain benefits in connection with a qualifying termination, as described below. We have also entered into change of control employment agreements with our NEOs and certain of our other key employees which provide for severance compensation, acceleration of vesting and a lump sum payout in lieu of a continuation of benefits upon qualified termination of employment following a change of control. Additionally, equity awards under our Equity Incentive Plan, including awards previously granted by our former parent company that have been converted into equity awards that relate to Energizer's common stock, provide for acceleration of vesting of certain awards in the event of certain terminations of employment. 
The information below reflects the value of acceleration or incremental compensation which each executive officer would receive upon the termination of his or her employment or upon a change in control. Because the value of awards and incremental compensation depend on several factors, actual amounts can only be determined at the time of the event. 
The information is based on the following assumptions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the event of termination (death, permanent disability, involuntary termination without cause, or voluntary termination),  or a change of control of the Company, occurred on September 30, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the market value of our common stock on that date was $58.65 (the actual closing price on September 28, 2018, the  last trading day of the fiscal year); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of the executive officers were terminated on that date.  
[END TABLE]
The information does not reflect benefits that are provided under our plans or arrangements that do not discriminate in favor of executive officers and are available generally to all salaried employees—such as amounts accrued under our 401(k) plan, accumulated and vested benefits under our retirement plans (including our pension restoration plan and executive savings investment plan), health, welfare and disability benefits, and accrued vacation pay. For amounts accrued under retirement plans, see "Pension Benefits Table". 
The information also does not include amounts under our deferred compensation plan or executive savings investment plan that would be paid, as described in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table", except to the extent that an executive officer is entitled to an accelerated benefit as a result of the termination. 
Executive Severance Plan 
On July 1, 2015, we adopted an executive severance plan which provides benefits to our senior executives, including each of the NEOs, in the event of a "qualifying termination" as defined in the plan, which means an involuntary termination without "cause" or a voluntary termination as a result of "good reason." Post-termination benefits for the senior executives consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment of one or two times his or her annual base salary at the time of the qualifying termination, which  will be two times for Messrs. Hoskins, Gorman and LaVigne and one time for Mr. Kinder and Ms. Boss;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Messrs. Hoskins, Gorman and LaVigne, a pro-rata bonus payment based on the  number of days during the bonus year the participant was employed and the amount of annual bonus which the participant would have received if he had remained employed, based on actual Company performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• outplacement services for up to 12 months for each of the NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
The payment of benefits under the plan is conditioned upon the executive officer executing a general release in favor of the Company, as well as confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and non-competition obligations. In addition, no benefits will be paid to the extent duplicative of benefits under a change in control or similar agreement with the Company.

Death, Disability or Termination of Employment (Other than Upon a Change of Control) 
Upon an executive officer's death, permanent disability, involuntary termination other than for cause (defined as termination for gross misconduct), and, in some cases, retirement, the following plans or programs provide for acceleration of certain awards. Awards are accelerated for retirement after attainment of age 55 with 10 years of service (including service with our former parent companies) if granted 12 or more months prior to retirement date. No awards are accelerated upon other voluntary termination or involuntary termination for cause. Performance awards vesting upon retirement are paid when results for the Performance Period are met.

Change of Control of the Company 
Our change of control employment agreements with each of the NEOs have terms of two or three years from July 1, 2015, subject to certain automatic renewal provisions. For Messrs. Hoskins and LaVigne, the term is three years. For Messrs. Gorman and Kinder and for Ms. Boss, the term is two years. The agreement provides that the executive officer will receive severance compensation in the event of certain termination events (as provided in the agreement), other than for cause, death or disability, or within specified periods following a change in control of the Company, as such terms are defined in the agreement. 
Under the agreements, a change of control is generally defined as an acquisition of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Company, a person beneficially owning more than 20% of the total voting power of the Company, or an unapproved change in the majority of the Board. 
Under the agreements, upon a change of control, each executive officer will receive a pro rata annual bonus for the portion of the year occurring prior to a change of control. If the executive officer is terminated under the termination events defined in the agreement within specified periods of the change of control, the severance compensation payable under the agreement consists of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a payment equal to a multiple of the executive officer's annual base salary and target bonus (defined as the most  recent five year actual bonus percentages multiplied by the greater of base salary at either termination or change of control), which will be three times in the case of Messrs. Hoskins and LaVigne and two times in the case of Messrs.  Gorman, Kinder and Ms. Boss;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro rata portion of the executive officer's target annual bonus for the year of termination; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum payment intended to assist with health and welfare benefits for a  period of time post-termination.  
[END TABLE]
Following termination of employment, each executive officer is bound by a one year covenant not to compete, a one year non-solicitation covenant, and a covenant of confidentiality. No severance payments under the agreements would be made in the event that an executive officer's termination is voluntary (other than for good reason), is due to death, disability or normal retirement, or is for cause. Under the agreements, in the event that it is determined that a "golden parachute" excise tax is due under the Internal Revenue Code, we will reduce the aggregate amount of the payments payable to an amount such that no such excise tax will be paid if the resulting amount would be greater than the after-tax amount if the payments were not so reduced.

Executive Compensation 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLE 
The agreements also provide that upon a change of control, outstanding equity awards held by each executive officer will accelerate and vest in accordance with the terms of the awards, even if the awards have a higher threshold for a "change of control". Our equity awards generally define a "change of control" as an acquisition of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The terms of our outstanding equity awards vary as to the portion of the unvested award that will accelerate and vest upon a change of control, as indicated below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Three-year performance awards granted 11/14/16      The greater of (i) the number of stock equivalents granted at target or (ii) the amount of target performance stock  equivalents which would have vested had the performance period ended on the date the change of control occurs   
 Three-year performance awards granted 11/14/16      The greater of (i) the number of stock equivalents granted at target or (ii) the amount of target performance stock  equivalents which would have vested had the performance period ended on the date the change of control occurs

[END TABLE]
Payments of cash would be made in a lump sum no sooner than six months following termination of employment. 
Estimated Payments and Benefits 
Based on the assumptions set out above, the following chart sets forth estimated payments to our NEOS upon termination following a change of control. If a change of control occurs but their employment is not terminated, the agreements provide a more limited value. The value of accelerated restricted stock equivalents and performance awards reflects a stock price of $58.65 (the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2018). Stock market declines and vesting and forfeitures of unvested restricted stock equivalents since September 30, 2018 are not reflected in these valuations. Upon a change of control, retirement benefits under the executive savings investment plan vest to the extent not already vested.

Proposal 2: Approving Our Executive Compensation Program (an Advisory, Non-binding "Say on Pay" Resolution) 
We are providing an advisory vote and seeking approval of our executive compensation for fiscal 2018. At our 2016 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, a majority of shareholders voted to have a Say on Pay vote each year. As a result, we will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually at least until the next shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. 
Although the Say on Pay vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, our Human Capital Committee takes into consideration the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. At the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, more than 97% of the votes cast favored our Say on Pay proposal. The Human Capital Committee considered this result and input from various stakeholders, and in light of the strong support, maintained a consistent overall approach for fiscal 2018. 
Our Board believes that our current executive compensation program appropriately links compensation realized by our executive officers to our performance and properly aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. The details of this compensation for fiscal 2018, and the reasons we awarded it, are described in our Proxy Statement. 
Our Board recommends a vote FOR approving our executive compensation (an advisory, nonbinding Say on Pay resolution).

Audit Committee Matters 
 AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY 
The Audit Committee has a formal policy concerning approval of all services to be provided by our independent auditor, including audit, audit-related, tax and other services. The policy requires that all services the auditor may provide to us must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee has the authority to pre-approve permitted services that require action between regular Audit Committee meetings; provided, he reports to the Audit Committee at the next regular meeting. Early in each fiscal year, the Audit Committee approves the list of planned audit and non-audit services to be provided by the auditor during that year, as well as a budget estimating spending for such services for the fiscal year. Any proposed services exceeding the maximum fee levels set forth in that budget must receive specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. As applicable, the Audit Committee pre-approved all fees and services paid by Energizer for fiscal 2018 and 2019. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The Audit Committee of the Company's  Board of Directors consists entirely of non-employee directors that are independent, as defined in Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.   The Audit Committee is responsible for the duties set forth in its  charter, but is not responsible for preparing the financial statements, implementing or assessing internal controls or auditing the financial statements. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting  process. The independent accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the  "PCAOB") and issuing a report thereon. The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.   As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Committee reviews and discusses with both management and the Company's  independent registered public accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), all annual and quarterly financial statements prior to their issuance. With respect to the Company's audited financial statements for the Company's  fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, management of the Company has represented to the Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Committee has reviewed and discussed  those financial statements with management and PwC, including a discussion of critical accounting policies, the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles followed, the reasonableness of significant judgments reflected in such  financial statements and clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee has also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, as adopted by the PCAOB.   In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for reviewing the  services performed by Energizer's independent registered public accountants, the Audit Committee retains sole authority to select, evaluate and replace the outside auditors, discusses with the independent registered public accountants the  overall scope of the annual audit and the proposed audit fees, and annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public accountants and its lead audit partner. Annually the Audit Committee oversees  a process to assess the performance of the auditor and utilizes the results of that assessment when considering their reappointment. The Committee also annually discusses PwC's internal quality review process and the PCAOB's inspection  report on PwC, as well as the results of any internal quality reviews or PCAOB inspections of key engagement team members. In accordance with SEC rules, lead audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive  years an individual partner may provide service to the Company. For lead and concurring partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service is five years. The process for selection of the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this  rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.

The Audit Committee has also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, as adopted by the PCAOB.   In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for reviewing the  services performed by Energizer's independent registered public accountants, the Audit Committee retains sole authority to select, evaluate and replace the outside auditors, discusses with the independent registered public accountants the  overall scope of the annual audit and the proposed audit fees, and annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public accountants and its lead audit partner. Annually the Audit Committee oversees  a process to assess the performance of the auditor and utilizes the results of that assessment when considering their reappointment. The Committee also annually discusses PwC's internal quality review process and the PCAOB's inspection  report on PwC, as well as the results of any internal quality reviews or PCAOB inspections of key engagement team members. In accordance with SEC rules, lead audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive  years an individual partner may provide service to the Company. For lead and concurring partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service is five years. The process for selection of the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this  rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.    
      The Audit Committee of the Company's  Board of Directors consists entirely of non-employee directors that are independent, as defined in Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.   The Audit Committee is responsible for the duties set forth in its  charter, but is not responsible for preparing the financial statements, implementing or assessing internal controls or auditing the financial statements. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting  process. The independent accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the  "PCAOB") and issuing a report thereon. The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.

[BEGIN TABLE]
      The Audit Committee has received the  written disclosures from PwC required by PCAOB Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), as modified or supplemented, and has discussed the independence of PwC with members of that firm. In doing so, the Committee  considered whether the non-audit services provided by PwC were compatible with its independence. In fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met five times with the internal auditors and PwC, with and without  management present, to discuss the results of their examination, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.   In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed key initiatives and  programs aimed at maintaining the effectiveness of the Company's internal and disclosure control structure. As part of this process, the Committee continued to monitor the scope and adequacy of the Company's internal auditing program,  reviewing internal audit department staffing levels and steps taken to maintain the effectiveness of internal procedures and controls.   Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the audited  financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for that year and has selected PwC as the Company's independent  registered public accountants for fiscal year 2019.

Proposal 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor 
Our Audit Committee, in accordance with authority granted in its charter by the Board, appointed PwC as independent auditor for the current fiscal year. PwC has served as our independent auditor since our Spin-Off from Edgewell Personal Care Company ("Edgewell") and served as Edgewell's independent auditor for every fiscal year since 2000. PwC has begun certain work related to the fiscal 2019 audit, as approved by the Audit Committee. Information on independent auditor fees for the last two fiscal years is set forth below. The Board and the Audit Committee believe that the retention of PwC to serve as independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In making this determination, the Board and the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee members' assessment of PwC's performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management's assessment of PwC's performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's independence and integrity  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's fees and the quality of services provided to the Company  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's global capabilities and knowledge of our global operations  
[END TABLE]
A representative of PwC is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if desired, as well as to respond to appropriate questions. Although NYSE listing standards require that the Audit Committee be directly responsible for selecting and retaining the independent auditor, we are providing shareholders with the means to express their views on this issue. Although this vote will not be binding, in the event the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will reconsider its appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent auditing firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The members of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent auditor for fiscal 2019.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers, and anyone holding 10% or more of a registered class of our equity securities (reporting persons) to file reports with the SEC showing their holdings of, and transactions in, Energizer securities. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports, and written representations from each reporting person that no other reports are required, we believe that for 2018 all reporting persons filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a).

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Our Board has adopted a written policy regarding the review and approval or ratification of transactions involving the Company and our directors, nominees for directors, executive officers, immediate family members of these individuals, and shareholders owning five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, each of whom is referred to as a related party. The policy covers any related party transaction, arrangement or relationship where a related party has a direct or indirect material interest and the amount involved exceeds $100,000 in any calendar year. Under the policy, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving, or ratifying, the material terms of any related party transactions. The Audit Committee is charged with determining whether the terms of the transaction are any less favorable than those generally available from unaffiliated third parties, and determining the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. 
In adopting the policy, the Board reviewed certain types of related party transactions described below and determined that they should be deemed to be pre-approved, even if the aggregate amount involved might exceed $100,000: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Officer or director compensation which would be required to be disclosed under Item 402 of the SEC's  compensation disclosure requirements, and expense reimbursements to these individuals in accordance with our policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transactions with another company at which a related party serves as an employee, director, or holder of less than 10%  of that company's outstanding stock, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of that company's consolidated gross revenues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Charitable contributions to a charitable trust or organization for which a related party serves as an employee, officer  or director, if the annual contributions by us do not exceed the greater of $100,000 or 2% of the organization's total annual receipts; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transactions in which all of our shareholders receive proportional benefits, the rates or charges involved are  determined by competitive bids, the transaction involves obtaining services from a regulated entity at rates fixed by law, or the transaction involves bank services as a depositary of funds, transfer agent or registrar, or similar services.   
[END TABLE]
Our legal department is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and procedures to obtain information from our directors and executive officers with respect to related party transactions. 
During fiscal 2018, there were no transactions with executive officers, directors or their immediate family members which were in an amount in excess of $100,000, and in which any such person had a direct or indirect material interest.

[END TABLE]
The holders of record of shares representing a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. 
The shares of a shareholder whose ballot on any or all proposals is marked as "abstain" will be included in the number of shares present at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to determine whether a quorum is present. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held by a broker or other custodian, you may instruct your broker how to vote your shares through the voting instruction form included with this Proxy Statement. If you wish to vote the shares you own beneficially at the meeting, you must first request and obtain a "legal proxy" from your broker or other custodian. If you choose not to provide instructions or a legal proxy, your shares are referred to as "uninstructed shares". Whether your broker or custodian has the discretion to vote these shares on your behalf depends on the ballot item. The following table summarizes the votes required for passage of each proposal and the effect of abstentions and uninstructed shares held by brokers.

You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the voting polls close at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting by submitting a properly executed proxy of a later date, a written notice of revocation (of your previously executed proxy) sent to our Corporate Secretary, or a vote cast in person at our Annual Shareholders' Meeting (however, attending the meeting without voting will not revoke a proxy). 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The Board of Directors is soliciting the proxy accompanying this Proxy Statement. Proxies may be solicited by executive officers, directors, and employees of the Company, none of whom will receive any additional compensation for their services. Georgeson, LLC may solicit proxies for a fee of $7,500 plus expenses. These solicitations may be made personally or by mail, facsimile, telephone, messenger, email, or the Internet. We will also reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their costs of sending the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock. 
HOUSEHOLDING 
To reduce costs and reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Shareholders' Meeting, a single Proxy Statement and Annual Report, along with individual proxy cards or individual Notices of Internet Availability, will be delivered in one envelope to certain shareholders having the same last name and address and to individuals with more than one account registered at our transfer agent with the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder. Shareholders participating in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. If you are a registered shareholder and would like to enroll in this service or receive individual copies of this year's and/or future proxy materials, please contact our transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., at 866-741-8213, by email at shareholder@broadridge.com or in writing to 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you are a beneficial shareholder, you may contact the broker or bank where you hold the account. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board does not intend to bring any other business before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, and so far as is known to our Board, no matters are to be brought before the meeting other than as specified in the notice of meeting. Our bylaws provide that shareholders may nominate candidates for directors or present a proposal or bring other business before an annual meeting only if they give timely written notice of the nomination or the matter to be brought not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the prior year's meeting, as described under "Shareholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting".

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management believes are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as acquisition and integration costs, acquisition inventory step up costs, gain on sale of real estate, restructuring activities, costs related to the spin, and income tax adjustments. These measures help investors to see year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. 
We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure:
