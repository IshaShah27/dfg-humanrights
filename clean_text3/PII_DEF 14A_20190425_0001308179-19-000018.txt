[BEGIN TABLE]
        Polaris Industries Inc.   2100 Highway 55   Medina, Minnesota 55340   763-542-0500   Fax: 763-542-0599   Dear Fellow Shareholders:   We are pleased to provide you with the enclosed  proxy materials and to invite you to participate in our 2019 Annual Meeting to be held on Thursday, April 25, 2019 at 9:00 a.m.,  Central time. The proxy materials that follow detail the agenda items for the meeting, how to vote your shares, and how to participate  in the meeting (including how to ask questions). On behalf of our Board of Directors, we encourage you to vote your shares and  hope that you will participate in the meeting.   Our vision of "fueling passion and  enriching lives" transcends our annual operating plans and along with our commitment to being "a customer centric,  highly efficient growth company" creates a sense of purpose that guides all that we do. Our highlights from 2018 demonstrate  how we put our actions behind our words.   We grew North American market share in side-by-sides,  ATVs, snowmobiles, and Indian motorcycles. We increased revenue by 12%. We generated an attractive ROIC of approximately 16%. We  significantly increased investment in innovation, tooling, and long-term capital projects. We continued to diversify our product  offerings, with the acquisition of Bennington, the #1 brand in pontoon boats. And we returned approximately $500 million to shareholders  through dividends and share repurchases. This is all evidence that the underlying performance of our business is robust. Unfortunately,  our strong performance has been overshadowed by the substantial impact of China-related tariffs.   As shareholders, we should be pleased with  the agility and tenacity Polaris employees demonstrated to deliver these results despite considerable headwinds, and we should  also be excited about the prospects for long-term growth and profitability that Polaris continues to develop. From our supply chain  transformation, to the indelible safety and quality culture that we have built, to our unwavering commitment to invest in innovation,  we are well positioned to achieve our long-term performance goals of 5% or more sales CAGR and 15% or greater Net Income CAGR by  2022.   Thank you for your continued  investment in Polaris.   Sincerely,      Scott W. Wine   Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer   March 11, 2019

Our highlights from 2018 demonstrate  how we put our actions behind our words.   We grew North American market share in side-by-sides,  ATVs, snowmobiles, and Indian motorcycles. We increased revenue by 12%. We generated an attractive ROIC of approximately 16%. We  significantly increased investment in innovation, tooling, and long-term capital projects. We continued to diversify our product  offerings, with the acquisition of Bennington, the #1 brand in pontoon boats. And we returned approximately $500 million to shareholders  through dividends and share repurchases. This is all evidence that the underlying performance of our business is robust. Unfortunately,  our strong performance has been overshadowed by the substantial impact of China-related tariffs.   As shareholders, we should be pleased with  the agility and tenacity Polaris employees demonstrated to deliver these results despite considerable headwinds, and we should  also be excited about the prospects for long-term growth and profitability that Polaris continues to develop. From our supply chain  transformation, to the indelible safety and quality culture that we have built, to our unwavering commitment to invest in innovation,  we are well positioned to achieve our long-term performance goals of 5% or more sales CAGR and 15% or greater Net Income CAGR by  2022.   Thank you for your continued  investment in Polaris.   Sincerely,      Scott W. Wine   Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer   March 11, 2019

Thank you for your investment in Polaris and for the confidence that you have placed in us as  stewards of your capital. Our Board is extremely committed on delivering long-term shareholder value for you. We actively oversee  management to guide company strategy, craft executive compensation programs that are clearly linked to our strategy, and commit  to a strong corporate governance framework.   It has been a privilege to serve with Scott  and my other fellow Directors, who are all highly dedicated, engaged, and qualified individuals who contribute deep operating and  industry experience and a broad range of perspectives to the Board. Since 2015, four new directors have joined the Board, resulting  in a rich diversity of knowledge, experience and perspectives across manufacturing, technology, finance, and marketing. Most recently,  in 2019, we added Gwynne Shotwell, President and Chief Operating Officer at SpaceX, who brings tremendous engineering aptitude  and business acumen to our Board.   During 2018, we also continued to expand  our shareholder engagement program. In 2018, we had a member of our Board, together with members of our executive management team,  meet with a cross-section of our stockholders. We welcome the opportunity to engage with our shareholders and will continue to  expand our shareholder engagement efforts in 2019.   We continue to simplify and improve the  readability of our proxy statement. This year, we have included an executive summary highlighting our strategic vision and 2018  performance results and summarizing key elements of our corporate governance and compensation principles, along with our environmental  sustainability initiatives. We encourage you to review this proxy statement to learn more about your Board, our governance practices,  compensation programs, and the proposals to be voted on at this year's Annual Meeting.   I hope you can participate in our Annual  Meeting and vote your Polaris shares this year. On behalf of our Board of Directors, thank you again for your investment in Polaris.

Thank you for your investment in Polaris and for the confidence that you have placed in us as  stewards of your capital. Our Board is extremely committed on delivering long-term shareholder value for you. We actively oversee  management to guide company strategy, craft executive compensation programs that are clearly linked to our strategy, and commit  to a strong corporate governance framework.   It has been a privilege to serve with Scott  and my other fellow Directors, who are all highly dedicated, engaged, and qualified individuals who contribute deep operating and  industry experience and a broad range of perspectives to the Board. Since 2015, four new directors have joined the Board, resulting  in a rich diversity of knowledge, experience and perspectives across manufacturing, technology, finance, and marketing. Most recently,  in 2019, we added Gwynne Shotwell, President and Chief Operating Officer at SpaceX, who brings tremendous engineering aptitude  and business acumen to our Board.   During 2018, we also continued to expand  our shareholder engagement program. In 2018, we had a member of our Board, together with members of our executive management team,  meet with a cross-section of our stockholders. We welcome the opportunity to engage with our shareholders and will continue to  expand our shareholder engagement efforts in 2019.   We continue to simplify and improve the  readability of our proxy statement. This year, we have included an executive summary highlighting our strategic vision and 2018  performance results and summarizing key elements of our corporate governance and compensation principles, along with our environmental  sustainability initiatives. We encourage you to review this proxy statement to learn more about your Board, our governance practices,  compensation programs, and the proposals to be voted on at this year's Annual Meeting.   I hope you can participate in our Annual  Meeting and vote your Polaris shares this year. On behalf of our Board of Directors, thank you again for your investment in Polaris.

Most recently,  in 2019, we added Gwynne Shotwell, President and Chief Operating Officer at SpaceX, who brings tremendous engineering aptitude  and business acumen to our Board.   During 2018, we also continued to expand  our shareholder engagement program. In 2018, we had a member of our Board, together with members of our executive management team,  meet with a cross-section of our stockholders. We welcome the opportunity to engage with our shareholders and will continue to  expand our shareholder engagement efforts in 2019.   We continue to simplify and improve the  readability of our proxy statement.

Financial and Operational Highlights

Our commitment to good corporate governance stems from our belief that a strong governance framework creates long-term value for our shareholders, strengthens Board and management accountability, and builds trust in Polaris and its brands.
Corporate Stewardship
In support of our environmental commitments, we have set forth three measurable and time-bound Environmental Sustainability goals. By 2022, we are striving to achieve:
Executive Compensation Highlights
Our executive compensation program is designed to incent our Executives to pursue strategies and execute priorities that promote growth and deliver strong returns to shareholders. The core elements of our compensation program consist of base salary, annual incentive, and long-term incentive.

Long-Term Focus
Support and reward executives for consistent performance over time and achievement of our long-term strategic goals.
Retention
Attract and retain highly qualified executives whose abilities are critical to our success and competitive advantage.
Corporate Governance
Board Leadership Structure
Mr. Wine holds the titles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of Polaris. The Board believes that the interests of having a unified leadership structure with positions of Chairman and CEO being held by the same person is currently appropriate for our Company. The Board has flexibility to choose a different Board leadership structure if and when it believes circumstances warrant. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the CEO is also the Chairman of the Board, then the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, who is an independent director, will serve as the Lead Director. The Board believes that its independent Board committees and Lead Director provide appropriate independent Board leadership and oversight. Mr. Wiehoff is currently our Lead Director. The duties and responsibilities of the Lead Director, among others, include:
LEAD DIRECTOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Risk Oversight
Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for regularly reviewing and discussing with management our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including management's guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. When the Board deems it appropriate, responsibility of oversight of a specific risk is assigned to another one of the Board's committees.
We engage in an Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process. The ERM process consists of periodic risk assessments performed by various functional management groups during the year. Executive management presents these assessments to the Audit Committee to ensure that the process is sound and complete, oversight is appropriate, and the risks and risk assessments are thoroughly reviewed. In addition, the Audit Committee reports regularly to the full Board, which also considers our risk profile. While our management is responsible for day-to-day risk management identification and mitigation, the Board, directly and through its committees, oversees the execution of the ERM process. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our Company and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach.
Board Diversity
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying individuals who it considers qualified to become Board members. In furtherance of this duty, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers, as required by its charter as well as the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board's overall balance of diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences in areas relevant to the Company's activities when selecting Board nominees, although the Company does not maintain a formal policy regarding the diversity of Board members. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee views diversity broadly and evaluates a wide range of criteria as it makes its selections, including, among others, functional areas of experience, educational background, employment experience, and leadership performance. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also assesses those intangible factors it deems necessary to develop a heterogeneous and cohesive Board such as integrity, judgment, intelligence, and the willingness and ability of the candidate to devote adequate time to Board duties for a sustained period.
Our Board and each of its committees engage in an annual self-evaluation process. As part of that process, directors provide feedback on whether the Board is meeting its diversity objectives and how the composition of the Board should be altered in order to enhance its value to our Company and shareholders.
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Independence
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be viewed online on our website at www.polaris.com. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which adopt the current standards for "independence" established by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), a majority of the members of the Board must be independent as determined by the Board. In making its determination of independence, among other things, the Board must have determined that the director has no material relationship with the Company either directly or indirectly as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us. The Board of Directors has determined that Mses. Clayton, Henricks, and Shotwell, and Messrs. Bilicic, Farr, Hendrickson, Kessler, Kingsley, and Wiehoff are independent. Mr. Wine, our Chairman and CEO, is the only director who is not independent.
The Board based its independence determinations, in part, upon a review by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board of certain transactions between the Company and companies with which certain of our directors have relationships, each of which was made in the ordinary course of business, at arm's length, at prices and on terms customarily available to unrelated third party vendors or customers generally, in amounts that are not material to our business or the business of such unaffiliated corporation, and in which the director had no direct or indirect personal interest, nor received any personal benefit. Specifically, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board reviewed ordinary course of business purchases by us from C. H. Robinson Worldwide, where Mr. Wiehoff is, and during fiscal 2018 was, the CEO. The payments were less than the greater of $1,000,000 or 2.0% of the recipient's gross revenues in fiscal 2018. Accordingly, a majority of our Board is considered to be independent. Additionally, all current members of our Audit, Compensation, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees are considered to be independent.
Shareholder Engagement
The board is committed to ongoing engagement with our shareholders on executive compensation and corporate governance issues. To that end, the board has worked with management to develop an annual shareholder engagement process. These engagement efforts take place throughout the year involving members of our board of directors, senior management, and shareholder representatives. In 2018, Polaris reached out to shareholders representing approximately 53% of our outstanding shares and members of Polaris' Board of Directors and management team met with shareholders owning approximately 18% of the Company. The meeting agendas included discussions on various topics, including company strategy, compensation, governance practices, sustainability and board refreshment and diversity. The feedback from these meetings helps inform the Board and management on compensation and corporate governance practices and trends.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all employees, including our CEO, our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and all other executive officers, and the Board. A copy of the Polaris Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.polaris.com. In the event we waive any of the provisions of the Polaris Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with respect to the CEO, CFO, any executive officer or member of the Board that relates to any element of the definition of "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we intend to disclose such actions on our website at the same location.
Hedging and Pledging Policy
We adopted a policy that prohibits Directors and executive officers from engaging in hedging transactions with respect to our common stock. We also adopted a policy that permits Directors and executive officers to pledge our common stock as collateral for a loan only if it is pre-approved by the Company's General Counsel and CFO. The Director or executive officer must clearly demonstrate the financial capacity to repay the loan without resorting to the pledged securities. No Directors or executive officers pledged shares of common stock during 2018.
Communications with the Board
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a process has been established by which shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with members of the Board. Any shareholder or other interested party who desires to communicate with the Board, individually or as a group, may do so by writing to the intended member or members of the Board, c/o Corporate Secretary, Polaris Industries Inc., 2100 Highway 55, Medina, Minnesota 55340.
All communications received in accordance with these procedures will be reviewed initially by the office of our Corporate Secretary to determine whether the communication is a message to one or more of our directors and then will be relayed to the appropriate director or directors unless the Corporate Secretary determines that the communication is an advertisement or other promotional material. The director or directors who receive any such communication will have discretion to determine whether the subject matter of the communication should be brought to the attention of the full Board or one or more of its committees and whether any response to the person sending the communication is appropriate.
Board Meetings
During 2018, the full Board met five times. Each of the meetings was preceded and/or followed by an executive session of the Board without management in attendance, chaired by Mr. Wiehoff. Each of our directors attended at least 75 percent of the meetings of the Board and any committee on which that director served in 2018. The Board also took action in writing three times in 2018. We do not maintain a formal policy regarding the Board's attendance at annual shareholder meetings; however, Board members are expected to regularly attend all Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which they serve as well as the annual shareholder meetings. All then-current members of the Board attended our 2018 Annual Meeting.
Committees of the Board and Meetings
The Board has designated four standing committees. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Technology Committee each operate under a written charter, which is available on our website at www.polaris.com. The current membership of each committee and its principal functions, as well as the number of times it met during 2018, are described below.

 Compensation Committee   Members:   Gary E. Hendrickson, Chair    Annette K. Clayton    John P. Wiehoff     All members of the Compensation Committee          have been determined to be "independent" by the Board in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the          applicable listing requirements of the NYSE.   Functions:   The Compensation Committee assists the Board          in establishing a philosophy and policies regarding executive and director compensation, provides oversight to the administration          of our director and executive compensation, administers our equity-based and cash incentive plans, reviews and approves the compensation          of executive officers and senior management, reviews and recommends the compensation of the directors to the Board, reviews and          discusses the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this Proxy Statement with management, and prepares any report on          executive compensation required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or other regulatory body, including the Compensation Committee          Report that appears later in this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee met five times during 2018 and took action in writing          once.   Use of          Compensation Consultant   The Compensation Committee has the          authority         to retain independent counsel and other independent experts or consultants. The Compensation Committee          engaged Willis Towers Watson         to act as its compensation consultant again in 2018. The Compensation Committee uses its          compensation consultant in an advisory         role for various technical, analytical, and plan design issues related to our          compensation and benefit programs including, collecting         market information on a variety of executive pay and design          issues and assisting in the design and review of programs such as our         long-term incentive program and annual cash          incentive plan. The compensation consultant does not determine compensation for any         of our executives, a role that is          reserved to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence         of Willis Towers          Watson pursuant to the rules of the SEC and concluded no conflict of interest exists that would prevent the independent          representation of the Compensation Committee. We used Willis Towers Watson for non-executive consultation services in 2018          for         which it was paid $22,750.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
During 2018, we did not engage in any transactions with related persons that are required to be described in this Proxy Statement pursuant to applicable SEC regulations.
Our written Related-Person Transactions Policy, which is applicable to all of our directors, nominees for directors, executive officers and 5% shareholders and their respective immediate family members, prohibits "related-person transactions" unless approved or ratified by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
Matters considered to be a related-person transaction subject to the policy include any transaction in which we are directly or indirectly a participant and the amount involved exceeds or reasonably can be expected to exceed $120,000, and in which a director, nominee for director, executive officer or 5% shareholder, or any of their respective family members, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
Any potential related-person transaction that is raised will be analyzed by the General Counsel, in consultation with management and with outside counsel, as appropriate, to determine whether the transaction or relationship constitutes a related-person transaction requiring compliance with the policy. The potential related-person transaction and the General Counsel's conclusion and the analysis thereof are also to be reported to the chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall review the material facts of all related-person transactions that require the committee's approval and either approve or disapprove of the related person transaction. If advance committee approval of a related-person transaction is not feasible, then the related-person transaction shall be considered and, if the committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at the committee's next regularly scheduled meeting. Any related-person transaction that is not approved or ratified, as the case may be, shall be voided, terminated or amended, or such other actions shall be taken, in each case as determined by the committee, so as to avoid or otherwise address any resulting conflict of interest.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
All current members of the Compensation Committee are considered independent under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. During fiscal year 2018, none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or its equivalent) or board of directors of another entity whose executive officers served on our Compensation Committee or Board.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes of ownership of our common stock with the SEC. Executive officers and directors are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. To our knowledge, based solely upon a review of the reports filed by the executive officers and directors during 2018 and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that, during the year ended December 31, 2018, all filing requirements applicable to our directors, executive officers and 10% beneficial owners, if any, were complied with on a timely basis.
Proposal 1 — Election of Directors
General Information
The Board is divided into three classes. The members of one class are elected at each annual meeting of shareholders to serve three-year terms. The Class I directors currently serving on the Board, whose terms expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting, are Bernd F. Kessler, Lawrence D. Kingsley, Gwynne E. Shotwell, and Scott W. Wine.
Upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, the Board proposes that Bernd F. Kessler, Lawrence D. Kingsley, Gwynne E. Shotwell, and Scott W. Wine be elected as Class I directors for three-year terms expiring in 2022. All nominees are presently Polaris directors who were elected by shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting, except for Gwynne E. Shotwell, who joined the Board on March 1, 2019.
The persons named in the proxy intend to vote your proxy for the election of each of the four nominees, unless you indicate on the proxy that you vote to "abstain" or vote "against" any or all of the nominees. Our Articles of Incorporation require that a director nominee will be elected only if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in an uncontested election, that is, the number of shares voted "for" that nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. A vote to "abstain" will not have an effect in determining the election results. If you are voting by telephone or on the Internet, you will be told how to abstain your vote from some or all of the nominees. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his or her successor has been elected, or until his or her death, resignation or retirement.
We expect each nominee standing for election as a director to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for substitute nominees designated by the Board, unless an instruction to the contrary is indicated on the proxy. There are no family relationships between or among any of our executive officers, directors or director nominees.
The Board, upon recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, unanimously recommends a vote FOR the election of these nominees as directors.
Information Concerning Nominees and Directors
Our directors bring a broad range of leadership and experience to the boardroom and regularly contribute to the dialogue involved in effectively overseeing and guiding our business and affairs. Other than our CEO, all of the members of the Board are independent. Preparation, engagement and participation are expected from our directors. We insist on high personal and professional ethics, integrity and values. All of our current directors and the director nominees satisfy such requirements. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are observed by all directors. With a diverse mix of experience, backgrounds and skill sets, the Board believes it is well positioned to represent the best interests of the Company's shareholders. The principal occupation, specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills and certain other information about the nominees and other directors whose terms of office continue after the Annual Meeting are set forth on the following pages.
On January 30, 2019, Gwynne E. Shotwell was appointed by the Board of Directors as a Class I member of the Board of Directors with her initial term becoming effective on March 1, 2019. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee led the process for selecting Ms. Shotwell and recommending her to the Board. Based upon the composition and qualifications of the current Board members, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee focused on diverse candidates with strong technology and executive leadership experience.
In 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee retained Crist Kolder Associates, an independent executive search firm, to assist with its director search and recommend candidates who satisfied the Board's criteria. Ms. Shotwell was first identified by Crist Kolder Associates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates qualified director nominees at regular or special Committee meetings and reviews qualified director nominees with the Board. A range of directors, including all those on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the CEO & Chairman of the Board, interview potential Board candidates.
If a shareholder wishes to have the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consider a candidate for nomination as a director, the shareholder's notice must include the information specified in our bylaws, including the shareholder's name and address, the information required to be disclosed by the SEC's proxy rules, a written consent of the candidate to be named in the proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected, specified information regarding the shareholder's interests in our capital stock, and the representations specified in our bylaws. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate recommended nominees based on the factors identified in the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Charter, a copy of which is available on our website at www.polaris.com. Alternatively, shareholders may directly nominate a person for election to our Board by complying with the procedures set forth in our bylaws, any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and any other applicable laws.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the "CD&A") describes our compensation objectives and policies and the compensation awarded to our Named Executive Officers during 2018. Our Named Executive Officers during 2018 were:
Ms. Clark Dougherty joined the Company on January 29, 2018.
Executive Summary
Key 2018 Company Financial Performance*
*  All results measured against fiscal 2017.
2018 Compensation Decisions
Consistent with our compensation philosophy of paying for performance, our compensation programs closely link pay and performance.
Our performance during 2018 resulted in the following compensation actions:
Return to Shareholders
Because significant portions of our executive compensation program are equity-based, the amount of compensation (defined as salary, annual incentive payment and grant date fair value of equity awards) ultimately realized by our Named Executive Officers is closely linked to the performance of our common stock, which is reflected in the following chart which compares our annualized total shareholder return to that of the members of our 2018 Peer Group listed on page 20:
Our 2017 Say on Pay Results and Shareholder Outreach
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considers the results of the Company's annual shareholder advisory votes approving the Company's executive compensation. Shareholders approved on an advisory basis the Company's Say on Pay proposal at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders with 83.6% of the votes cast (excluding abstentions) in favor of the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. Beginning in late 2016 and continuing throughout 2018, the Compensation Committee, together with key members of management, conducted a shareholder outreach program to discuss our corporate governance and executive compensation programs, policies and practices with some of our largest shareholders. The outreach program is designed to maintain an ongoing relationship with investors to better understand their issues and perspectives on the Company, including executive compensation practices. We plan to continue the outreach program in the years to come. To the extent the Compensation Committee receives specific comments about executive compensation policies or practices, it will take them into consideration when making its decisions.
Objectives of Our Compensation Program
Our executive compensation philosophy aligns executive compensation decisions with our desired business direction, strategy and performance. The primary objectives and priorities of the compensation program for our Named Executive Officers are the following:
To achieve these objectives, we have designed an executive compensation program that is significantly weighted towards long-term goals. This approach aids us in the retention of executive officers and assures that the interests of our executive officers and shareholders are aligned. Although the program emphasizes performance-based and equity-based compensation as a percentage of total direct compensation (base salary and annual and long-term incentives), we do not have specific policies governing the allocation of the total direct compensation opportunity among its various components. The following charts illustrate the percentage of the 2018 target total direct compensation opportunity for Mr. Wine and the other Named Executive Officers as a group represented by each compensation component – base salary, target annual incentive and grant date fair value of long-term incentives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 TARGET TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION (MR. WINE)    2018 TARGET TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION (AVERAGE OF OTHER NEOs) 
 2018 TARGET TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION (MR. WINE)    2018 TARGET TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION (AVERAGE OF OTHER NEOs) 
[END TABLE]
*  At-risk compensation does not include RSUs.
Since a significant majority of our executive compensation is equity based, actual compensation outcomes vary with Company and stock price performance, closely aligning pay and performance. At the beginning of 2016, our stock price was $88.36. We closed 2018 with a stock price of $76.68. As a result, over that same period, our CEO's pay was well below his targeted non-equity compensation and the grant date fair value of his equity awards.
CEO PAY FOR PERFORMANCE (TOTAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION)
We believe that our compensation policies and practices are designed to mitigate compensation-related risks to the Company's long-term performance, ethical standards and reputation. The table below illustrates some of those policies and practices.

Determining Executive Compensation
Compensation Committee Process
The Compensation Committee is responsible for the review and approval of all aspects of our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee meets in January or February of each year to: (i) establish the annual base salary and annual incentive compensation opportunity for each of the executive officers for the current year; (ii) determine the actual annual incentive compensation to be paid to each executive officer for services provided during the prior year; (iii) establish plan targets and performance measures for the three-year performance period beginning on January 1 of the current year for long-term incentive awards; (iv) determine the number of PRSUs earned, if any, under the long-term incentive program for the three-year performance period ended on the immediately preceding December 31st; and (v) determine stock option awards, RSU awards and any other equity-based awards to be granted to executive officers.
When making individual compensation decisions for the executive officers, the Compensation Committee takes many factors into account. These factors include subjective and objective considerations of each individual's skills, performance and level of contribution towards desired business objectives, our overall performance, retention concerns, the individual's tenure and experience with our Company and in his or her current position, the recommendations of management, the individual's current and historical compensation, the Compensation Committee's compensation philosophy, and comparisons to other comparably situated executive officers (both those of the Company and those of the peer group companies). The Compensation Committee's process utilizes input, analysis and review from a number of sources, including our management, other independent directors of the Board, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and market studies and other comparative compensation information as discussed below.
The Compensation Committee uses this information in conjunction with its own review of the various components of our executive compensation program to determine the base salary and annual and long-term incentive targets and opportunities of the executive officers as a group and individually.
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Compensation
The Compensation Committee meets with our CEO annually to review the performance of our other executive officers. The meeting includes an in-depth review of each executive officer, achievement of individual performance objectives established at the beginning of the year and individual contributions towards achievement of our business goals. A summary of the performance review is presented to the full Board each year.
The Compensation Committee considers input from our CEO, EVP CFO, and Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") when developing and selecting metrics and performance objectives for our Senior Executive Plan and long-term incentive program, and evaluating performance against such pre-established metrics and objectives. The Compensation Committee also receives recommendations from our CEO, with the assistance of our CHRO (for executive officers other than himself), regarding base salary amounts, annual incentive award amounts and equity-based incentive awards for our other executive officers. In determining the CEO's compensation, the Compensation Committee considers comparative compensation information and input from its independent compensation consultant.
Role of the Compensation Consultant
Willis Towers Watson provides the Compensation Committee with an annual compensation market analysis for the executive officers and directors; makes recommendations on the executive pay programs; reviews, participates and comments on executive and board compensation matters; and provides updates on regulatory changes in compensation related issues and other developments and trends in executive compensation.
Market Competitiveness Review
The compensation consultant and the Compensation Committee periodically reviewed the composition of the peer group of companies about which competitive compensation data is obtained. The peer group is established each July and is used for purposes of setting compensation for the following year.
In 2017, the Compensation Committee with the guidance of Willis Towers Watson reviewed the composition of the peer group and determined no changes were required. The companies comprising the Peer Group used to establish the 2018 compensation opportunities of the executive officers are listed below:
2018 PEER GROUP
Both management and the Compensation Committee believe that this peer group of 21 companies (the "Peer Group") provided a robust statistical set of comparison data to serve as the basis for 2018 compensation decisions. In connection with the compensation decisions made for 2018, Willis Towers Watson utilized data from the Willis Towers Watson 2017 General Industry Executive Compensation Database and our Peer Group companies in the market review.
The following table summarizes our scale relative to our 2018 industry peer group as of December 31, 2018.
2018 PEER GROUP COMPARISON
The reports furnished by compensation consultants provide the Compensation Committee with market information at the median and 75th percentiles for each executive officer position and pay component, and for total direct compensation, and compare the actual and target compensation provided and intended to be provided to each executive officer to the market amounts, which consider both the peer group data and the data contained in the surveys. This market information is an important element reviewed by the Compensation Committee, which generally intends to target base salaries for our executive officers at the market median for comparable positions as set forth in the report. The elements of annual and long-term incentive opportunities of total direct compensation are based on responsibilities of position, expected level of contribution and consideration of market data. The Compensation Committee can and does, however, use discretion to adjust a component of pay, or total direct compensation generally, above or below these ranges to recognize the specific circumstances of individual executive officers.
2018 Compensation Decisions
2018 Base Salaries
The Summary Compensation Table on page 27 sets forth the actual base salary earned by each of our Named Executive Officers during 2018. Base salary increases in 2018 were based on individual performance and were generally implemented to maintain the Named Executive Officer's position with respect to market median. 
The following table reflects the annualized base salaries as established by the Compensation Committee for Messrs. Wine, Speetzen, Musso and Pucel, and Ms. Clark Dougherty for 2018.
2018 Annual Incentive Compensation
Overview
Our Named Executive Officers and other members of senior management selected by the Compensation Committee are eligible to earn annual cash incentive compensation under our Senior Executive Plan ("SEP"), rather than under our broad-based annual profit sharing plan. Cash incentives to participants in the SEP are payable only if and to the degree we achieve annual financial performance objectives determined by the Compensation Committee.
Bonuses for Fiscal 2018 Performance
For 2018, the target payouts under the SEP expressed as a percentage of base salary were set by the Compensation Committee at 125% for Mr. Wine, 100% for Messrs. Speetzen, Pucel, Musso, and 80% for Ms. Clark Dougherty.
In determining whether and to what degree to approve payments under the SEP, the Compensation Committee gives primary consideration to the level of achievement of performance metrics it selects for inclusion in a performance matrix. For 2018, the Compensation Committee selected adjusted earnings per diluted share ("Adjusted EPS") as the sole performance metric for this purpose. The Adjusted EPS metric was chosen because it is a well-understood financial measure communicated in the public disclosure of our financial results, is used in determining payouts under our broad-based annual profit sharing plan, and is believed to significantly influence our stock price performance. In determining the Company's 2018 performance for purposes of the performance matrix, the Compensation Committee adjusted for certain unusual events (such as acquisitions, dispositions, restructurings and legal settlements) which results in Adjusted EPS of $6.24 as compared to GAAP EPS of $5.24.
The performance matrix included recommended annual incentive payouts as a percentage of base salary for each Named Executive Officer, depending upon the level of achievement on the performance metric. The percentage utilized for each Named Executive Officer for these purposes was based on the respective Named Executive Officer's level of responsibility, expected level of contribution and the Compensation Committee's general intention to target annual incentive compensation between the market median and the 75th percentile levels for comparable positions when financial targets are achieved.
The estimated threshold, target and maximum payments under the SEP for 2018 are reflected in the "Estimated Potential Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" column in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 on page 29. The amounts actually paid in connection with the SEP during each of the years 2016-2018 are set forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 27.
Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee sets challenging objectives for the metric incorporated in the matrix. In 2018, the target Adjusted EPS performance goal was set 22% greater than the amount achieved in 2017. The 2018 performance goals that were incorporated into the matrix are summarized in the following table:
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2018 was $6.24, which was 1% above target level performance of $6.20 in the performance matrix. The Compensation Committee considered a number of factors, primarily the payout amounts suggested by the performance matrix for the Named Executive Officer as set forth in the table below, but also our financial and operating performance as compared to fiscal 2017, Mr. Wine's assessment of the individual performance of the other Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee's assessment of Mr. Wine's individual performance and the motivational and retentive effects.
The following table shows the suggested payout as a percentage of base salary derived from the performance matrix, the actual payout as a percentage of eligible annual wages, and the actual amount paid in March 2019 under the SEP for each of our Named Executive Officers:
2018 Long-Term Compensation
Overview
Long-term compensation annually awarded by the Compensation Committee emphasizes performance-based equity vehicles, consisting of annual awards of stock options restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs). From time to time, supplemental equity awards are granted on a selective and limited basis, generally in connection with promotions, individual outstanding performance and ability to effect desired performance results, hiring of new executives and retention situations. These supplemental awards are discussed in the applicable section based on award type. All equity-based awards are granted under our Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan").
The Compensation Committee has chosen to provide a mix of stock options, PRSUs, and restricted stock units (RSUs) for its annual long-term incentive equity awards because it believes such a combination effectively aligns the financial interest of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. Stock options provide value only to the extent that the price of our common stock has appreciated over the option term. PRSUs may be earned and settled in shares of our common stock or, if elected by the executive officer, deferred into the Supplemental Retirement/Savings Plan ("SERP"), but only if and to the extent that we achieve over a three-year performance period financial performance objectives that are believed to correlate well with stock price performance. RSUs provide stability to total compensation packages and a retention benefit, while maintaining a focus on stock growth. RSU awards are also provided occasionally for new hires, promotions, or special recognition and are subject to three-year cliff vesting to maximize the retention benefit. The Compensation Committee provides a variable blended ratio between the types of awards depending on the desired performance outcome. The grant date fair value of annual 2018 long-term incentive awards granted to our Named Executive Officers was allocated 50% to stock options, 25% to PRSUs, and 25% to RSUs. The grant date fair value of target incentive opportunities varies based on responsibilities of position, expected level of contribution, company performance, market performance and consideration of market data.
Performance Restricted Stock Unit Awards (PRSUs)
PRSUs granted in 2018 may be earned during the course of the 2018-2020 performance period based on level of achievement against the performance objectives specified at the beginning of the performance period. All earned PRSUs will either vest and be paid out in the form of one share for each earned and vested PRSU or, if elected by the executive officer, the receipt of the shares may be deferred such that each resulting deferred stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock upon the settlement date elected by the Named Executive Officer under the SERP. Amounts deemed invested in deferred stock units in the SERP may be transferred into an alternative investment account in the SERP after a period of six months and one day.
A performance objective is intended to align the management's interests with those of shareholders. In 2018, the Compensation Committee selected total shareholder return relative to the Company's peer group ("Relative TSR"), net income, and revenue growth as the metrics for the PRSU awards. The Compensation Committee may use one or more other metrics in the future as it deems appropriate. The Committee believes that measuring the company's performance against these metrics may better reflect management's contributions. Relative TSR for the Company or any member of the Peer Group during the performance period means the cumulative total shareholder return during the performance period on the applicable company's common stock as measured by the change in the company's stock price from the beginning of the performance period to the end of the performance period and takes into account the assumed reinvestment of all dividends paid during the performance period. The beginning stock price for a company will be the average closing sales price as reported on the national securities exchange on which it trades during the period of November 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The ending stock price for a company will be the average closing sales price as reported on the national securities exchange on which it trades during the period of November 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.
Named Executive Officers who received a PRSU award may earn PRSUs based upon the level of achievement against a specified goal. The level of achievement against the performance objective will determine the number of PRSUs that may be earned. For the 2018-2020 performance period, the maximum number of PRSUs that each Named Executive Officer may earn was set by the Compensation Committee at 200% of target and the minimum performance objective was established at net income of $381 million (representing a 7% CAGR), Revenue of $5,931 million (representing a 3% CAGR), and a relative TSR rank in the 25th percentile. Performance below each of these level woulds result in no PRSUs vesting and consequently, no equity would be issued under this award.
For the PRSU awards made during 2018, the following table summarizes the PRSU threshold, target and maximum payouts for each Named Executive Officer:
PRSU PERFORMANCE PERIOD 2018-2020
2018 Stock Option Awards
Stock option awards granted under the Omnibus Plan during 2018 to our employees, including Named Executive Officers, have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. Our stock option grant practices for executive officers are designed to ensure that the stock option awards approved by the Compensation Committee at its January meeting will have an effective date occurring after the release of year-end financial results. We do not engage in the backdating, cancellation or re-pricing of stock options and have not engaged in such practices in the past.
The awards for our Named Executive Officers vest in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the January 31, 2018 grant date and have an exercise price of $113.01, which was the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the grant. The number of shares subject to each Named Executive Officer's 2018 stock option award is as follows:
2018 Restricted Stock Unit Awards
In 2018, we introduced RSUs to provide stability to total compensation and as a retention tool. The RSU awards for our Named Executive Officers vest on the third anniversary of the January 31, 2018 grant date. The number of shares subject to each Named Executive Officer's 2018 RSU award is as follows:
Other Executive Compensation Arrangements, Policies and Practices
Ms. Clark Dougherty's New Hire Compensation
On January 29, 2018, Ms. Clark Dougherty commenced her employment with Polaris. To attract Ms. Clark Dougherty to Polaris, she received a sign-on bonus of $350,000, and was also awarded 25,142 RSUs that vest ratably over three years to induce her to join the Company and to offset compensation forfeited at her previous employer. Assuming continuous employment, the RSUs vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the January 29, 2018 grant date. Ms. Clark Dougherty's sign-on bonus is subject to recapture in certain circumstances.
Sign-on compensation for Ms. Clark Dougherty is reflective of her significant industry experience and our desire to maintain a bonus structure for her similar to our other executives. Ms. Clark Dougherty's RSU award was designed to make her whole with respect to compensation forfeited from her former employer.
Health, Welfare and Retirement Benefits
We provide a full range of benefits to our Named Executive Officers, including the medical, dental and disability benefits generally available to our employees. We also sponsor a qualified 401(k) Plan in which our Named Executive Officers may participate on the same general basis as our employees, and which allows participants to make plan contributions on a pre-tax basis and to which we make Company-matching contributions dollar-for-dollar with employee contributions up to 5% of covered compensation.
Because the application of the annual compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") prevents our senior executives from fully contributing to the 401(k) Plan and receiving the full Company match, we have adopted a SERP intended to restore contributions lost because of the application of this annual compensation limit. Additionally, participation in the SERP offsets ESOP contributions generally provided to our non-executive employee population. The SERP provides executives who participate in the 401(k) Plan, including the Named Executive Officers, with the opportunity to defer up to 100% of their base salary, up to 100% of amounts payable under the Senior Executive Plan, and PRSU and RSU awards by making contributions to the SERP. Typically, base salary and Senior Executive Plan deferral contributions are matched by the Company as if they had been made under the 401(k) Plan on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 5% of covered compensation. The SERP is provided to assist executives in accumulating funds on a tax-advantaged basis for retirement and is consistent with observed competitive practices of similarly situated companies.
We do not maintain a defined benefit pension plan or a defined benefit supplemental pension plan for our executive officers.
Perquisites
We provide perquisites and personal benefits to our executive officers, generally in an effort to remain competitive with similarly situated companies. These perquisites and personal benefits consist of:
We prohibit personal use of corporate aircraft by any executive officer unless the Company is reimbursed for the full incremental cost to the Company of such use. Unused tickets from business related sponsorship agreements are from time- to-time made available for personal use. Tickets are included in sponsorship agreements and result in no incremental cost to the Company.
Severance Arrangements
We have entered into severance arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, which provide for certain benefits if an executive officer is involuntarily terminated without cause, terminated without cause in connection with a change in control, or if he or she terminates his or her employment for good reason. The severance arrangements with our Named Executive Officers were established as part of the negotiations of their initial employment terms. The severance arrangements are intended to:
The severance arrangements are described in more detail beginning on page 36 under the caption entitled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control."
Clawback Policy
Under our "clawback" policy, the Company may require reimbursement or cancellation of cash-based or equity-based incentive compensation awarded to any of our executive officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement, and if the award or payout was predicated upon the achievement of financial results that were restated. The policy applies to awards granted after November 1, 2010 and calls for the reimbursement or cancellation of the amount of the award or payout, net of taxes, in excess of what would have been granted or paid based on the actual results unless the Compensation Committee determines in its discretion that a lesser amount to be reimbursed or canceled is appropriate under the circumstances.
Deductibility of Compensation
The Committee has historically made an effort to ensure that the Company could deduct compensation expense under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limited the tax deductibility of annual compensation paid to NEOs other than the CFO to $1 million unless the compensation qualified as "performance based." The Company has always reserved the right to pay compensation that did not qualify as "performance based" from time to time.
The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act eliminated the ability to rely on this "performance based" exception unless the compensation is payable pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on November 2, 2017, and also expanded the limitation on deductibility generally to include all of the NEOs. As a result, the Company will generally no longer be able to take a deduction for any compensation paid to its NEOs in excess of $1 million.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Compensation Committee believes that an important means of aligning the interests of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, with the interests of our shareholders is to ensure that they own significant amounts of our common stock. The Compensation Committee adopted stock ownership guidelines which require executive officers to hold shares with a value equal to or exceeding a multiple of annual base salary as set forth in the table below. Each executive officer is expected to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines within four years following the date he or she becomes an executive officer. Executive officers are prohibited from entering into hedging transactions and are subject to restrictions on pledging Company stock as discussed on page 5.
Shares included in this calculation are those directly or indirectly owned, shares held in the SERP, outstanding PRSU awards at target levels and unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. The following table sets forth the stock ownership guidelines and whether the Named Executive Officers are in compliance with the guidelines:
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee assists the Board in establishing a philosophy and policies regarding executive and director compensation, provides oversight of the administration of our director and executive compensation programs and administers our equity-based compensation plans, reviews the compensation of directors, Named Executive Officers and senior management, and prepares any report on executive compensation required by the rules and regulations of the SEC or other regulatory body, including this Compensation Committee Report.
In performing its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on the review and discussions, we have recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Compensation Risk Assessment
Management conducts a risk assessment of our employee compensation policies and practices, including those that apply to our executive officers annually. Management reviewed our compensation plans, program design and existing practices as well as global and local compensation policies, programs and practices applicable to all employees. Management then analyzed the likelihood and magnitude of potential risks, focusing on whether any of our compensation policies and practices varied significantly from our overall risk and reward structure, whether any such policies and practices incentivized individuals to take risks that were inconsistent with our goals, and whether any such policies and practices have resulted in establishing an inappropriate balance between short-term and long-term incentive arrangements.
Management discussed the findings of the risk assessment with the Compensation Committee. Based on the assessment, we have concluded that our compensation policies and practices are aligned with the interests of shareholders, appropriately reward pay for performance, and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Additional Information About Plans and Agreements Affecting Reported Compensation
The following additional information is provided regarding various plans and agreements that affect the compensation information disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table above.
Offer Letters
We entered into an offer letter agreement with Ms. Clark Dougherty in connection with her hiring that provides for an annual base salary, subject to annual review, and generally provides for ongoing participation in incentive compensation, equity-based compensation and benefit plans. Ms. Clark Dougherty's letter agreement also provided for payment of a signing bonus that would be repayable on pro rata basis if she were to resign within twenty-four months.
Incentive Plan Awards
Senior Executive Plan
Annual cash incentive compensation awards are made to each of our Named Executive Officers and other eligible employees pursuant to the Senior Executive Plan. The Senior Executive Plan provides for the payment of awards to participants selected by the Compensation Committee to the degree we, or any subsidiary, business unit or geographic region thereof, achieves performance objectives specified by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of a calendar year performance period. The performance objectives are to be based on one or more business criteria specified in the Senior Executive Plan. In establishing our performance goals, the Compensation Committee provides that adjustments will be made for specified unusual events such as acquisitions, dispositions, restructurings and legal settlements. Although all awards are payable in cash, they may be denominated in cash and/or in units with a value equivalent to a share of our common stock.
Additional information about Senior Executive Plan awards made in 2018 to our Named Executive Officers, including the performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee and the determination of amounts to be paid, is provided under the caption "2018 Annual Incentive Compensation" on page 21. The estimated threshold, target and maximum payments under the Senior Executive Plan for 2018 are reflected in the "Estimated Potential Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" columns in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table on page 29. The amounts actually paid in connection with Senior Executive Plan awards during each of the years 2016-2018 are set forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 27.
Equity-Based Awards
Performance Restricted Stock Units
PRSU awards are made to each of our Named Executive Officers and other eligible employees pursuant to the Omnibus Plan. The PRSU awards will be earned to the degree that we, or any subsidiary, business unit or geographic region thereof, achieve performance objectives specified by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of a three-year performance period. The performance objectives are to be based on one or more business criteria specified in the Omnibus Plan or other metrics approved by the Compensation Committee. In establishing our performance goals, the Compensation Committee may provide that adjustments will be made for specified unusual events such as acquisitions, dispositions, restructurings and legal settlements.
Each PRSU will be paid out in the form of one share for each PRSU determined by the Compensation Committee to have been earned and vested over the applicable performance period. Below is a discussion of the PRSU awards over the past three years:
2018 PRSUs
Additional information about PRSU awards made in 2018 to our Named Executive Officers, including the performance periods and performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee, is provided under the caption "2018 Long-Term Compensation" on page 22. The estimated threshold, target and maximum awards for the 2018-2020 performance period and the grant date fair value of such awards are shown in the "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards" columns in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table on page 29.
2017 PRSUs
PRSUs granted in 2017 may be earned during the course of the 2017-2019 performance period based on level of achievement against the performance objectives specified at the beginning of the performance period. All earned PRSUs will either vest and be paid out in the form of one share for each earned and vested PRSU or, if elected by the executive officer, the receipt of the shares may be deferred such that each resulting deferred stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock upon the settlement date elected by the Named Executive Officer under the SERP. Amounts deemed invested in deferred stock units in the SERP may be transferred into an alternative investment account in the SERP after a period of six months and one day.
A performance objective is intended to align the management's interests with those of shareholders. In 2017, the Compensation Committee selected total shareholder return relative to the Company's peer group (relative TSR) as the single metric for the PRSU awards. Although relative TSR is the sole metric for 2017, the Compensation Committee may use one or more other metrics in the future as it deems appropriate. Relative TSR for the Company or any member of the Peer Group during the performance period means the cumulative total shareholder return during the performance period on the applicable company's common stock as measured by the change in the company's stock price from the beginning of the performance period to the end of the performance period and takes into account the assumed reinvestment of all dividends paid during the performance period. The beginning stock price for a company will be the average closing sales price as reported on the national securities exchange on which it trades during the period of November 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The ending stock price for a company will be the average closing sales price as reported on the national securities exchange on which it trades during the period of November 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.
Named Executive Officers who received a PRSU award may earn PRSUs based upon the level of achievement against a specified goal. The level of achievement against the performance objective will determine the number of PRSUs that may be earned. For the 2017-2019 performance period, the maximum number of PRSUs that each Named Executive Officer may earn was set by the Compensation Committee at 150% of target and the minimum performance objective was established as relative TSR rank in the 25th percentile. Performance below this level would result in no PRSUs vesting and consequently, no equity would be issued under this award.
2016 PRSUs
For PRSU awards granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period, we achieved approximately 16% return on invested capital, above the 12% goal required to earn the maximum number of PRSUs subject ot the awards. However, for purposes of the additional goals that had been established to guide the Compensation Committee's discretion in potentially paying out less than the maximum number of PRSUs, we achieved performance that was above the target level for revenue, and both net income from continuing operations and operating income as a percentage of sales were below the minimum threshold. As a result of this performance, the Compensation Committee determined that the PRSU awards would be paid out at 29.7% of target for the 2016-2018 performance period, and the amounts received by the Named Executive Officers are summarized in the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018" table on page 34.
Stock Options
Stock option awards granted under the Omnibus Plan during 2018 to employees of our Company, including our Named Executive Officers, have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. Each stock option granted to our Named Executive Officers vests and becomes exercisable in three equal installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant and has a 10-year term. If employment terminates for any reason other than disability, death or retirement, then any vested portion of the option will be generally exercisable for 30 days after employment ends unless terminated for cause. If employment terminates due to disability or death, then any unvested portion of the option will vest immediately and all exercisable options will remain exercisable for one year following termination of employment.
If employment terminates by reason of retirement, the vested option will be exercisable for the full term of the option and the unvested portion of the option will vest immediately and remain exercisable for the full term of the option provided that the grant occurred at least 12 months prior to the retirement date and notice of retirement was given to the Company at least one-year in advance. In no event will an option be exercisable beyond the end of its original term. Upon a change in control of our Company, each outstanding option will become immediately vested and exercisable in full only if the option is not continued, assumed or replaced or if the Named Executive Officer is terminated without cause or terminates his or her employment for good reason within one year of the event.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs provide stability to total compensation packages and a retention benefit, while maintaining a focus on stock growth. RSU awards are also provided occasionally for new hires, promotions, or special recognition and are subject to three-year cliff vesting to maximize the retention benefit. RSUs awarded to our Named Executive Officers during 2018 were granted under the Omnibus Plan and vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant. No dividend equivalents are paid on the RSUs. Upon a change in control of our Company, each outstanding RSU will become immediately vested in full only if the RSU is not continued, assumed or replaced or if the Named Executive Officer is terminated without cause or terminates his or her employment for good reason within one year of the event.
Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End
The following table sets forth information concerning unexercised stock option awards, unvested restricted stock awards, and unvested PRSU awards for each of the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2018.
Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018
The following table provides information concerning the aggregate number of stock options exercised and restricted stock units that vested for each of our Named Executive Officers during 2018, and the aggregate dollar values realized by each of our Named Executive Officers upon such event.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018
The following table sets forth information regarding the contributions by each Named Executive Officer and the Company to the SERP, as well as information regarding earnings, aggregate withdrawals and distributions and balances under the SERP, for each Named Executive Officer as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
We sponsor a 401(k) Plan that allows employees to make plan contributions on a pre-tax basis. Employees are automatically enrolled at 5% of covered compensation and can affirmatively elect to contribute 0-50% of covered compensation into the 401(k) Plan. We match employee contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 5% of base salary and Senior Executive Plan deferrals. Although Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan, the application of the annual compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code prevents Named Executive Officers from fully contributing to the 401(k) Plan and receiving the full Company match. The SERP provides executives who participate in the 401(k) Plan with the opportunity to defer up to net 100% of their base salary, up to 100% of amounts payable under the Senior Executive Plan, and PRSUs and RSU, into the SERP. Typically, base salary and Senior Executive Plan deferral contributions are matched by the Company as if they had been made under the 401(k) Plan on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to 5% of covered compensation. The SERP is intended solely to restore contributions lost because of the application of the annual compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code to the 401(k) Plan.
The SERP account of each Named Executive Officer is deemed to be invested in the fund(s) designated by the Named Executive Officer. For this purpose, the Named Executive Officers may choose among the same funds that are available to our employees generally under the 401(k) Plan or self-direct all or any portion of their investments. Deemed investment earnings and losses are applied to each Named Executive Officer's SERP account based upon the performance of the applicable investment fund. At December 31, 2018, accounts of the Named Executive Officers could be in self-directed investments or be invested in the following funds:
The return on these available mutual funds ranged from 1.74% to -36.22% in 2018. Under the SERP, the Named Executive Officers may elect to receive distributions (i) six months following separation of service or one year after separation of service; (ii) upon the attainment of a certain age, designated by the Named Executive Officer, between 59 ½ and 70 ½, provided that the Named Executive Officer will not attain the designated age for at least three years after his election; or (iii) the earlier or later of (i) or (ii). Named Executive Officers may elect to receive the distribution in a lump sum or in monthly, quarterly or annual installments over a period not to exceed 10 years. If the installment method is elected, the Named Executive Officer's account will continue to be credited with a prorated amount of deemed investment earnings and losses during the installment period.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control
Our Named Executive Officers are eligible to receive certain payments and benefits in the event of termination of their employment, including following a change in control, and upon a change in control pursuant to severance arrangements and equity award agreements with the Company.
Severance Arrangements with Named Executive Officers
We have entered into severance arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, which provide certain benefits to the Named Executive Officers upon their termination of employment under certain circumstances, including following a "change in control." For this purpose, a "change in control" is deemed to occur if:
Under the severance arrangements, a Named Executive Officer will be considered to have been terminated without cause if he or she is terminated other than for willful and continued nonperformance, conviction of a felony or other misconduct or detrimental actions as specified in the applicable agreement. A Named Executive Officer will be considered to have terminated his or her employment for good reason if he or she terminates employment due to a material reduction in title, authority, responsibilities or base compensation, a material change in the location of his or her principal place of employment or nonperformance by the Company of any material obligations owed to him or her, all as specified in the applicable agreement. For Mr. Musso, good reason includes a material reduction in base competition or benefits unless such reduction applies to all other executive officers of the Company.
Severance, Proprietary Information and Noncompetition Agreement with Mr. Wine
At December 31, 2018, we were a party to a severance, proprietary information and noncompetition agreement with Mr. Wine, our Chairman and CEO, dated September 1, 2008 ("Wine Severance Agreement"). The terms of the Wine Severance Agreement were established during the negotiations leading to his employment by the Company as our CEO. Mr. Wine is entitled to certain payments and benefits under the Wine Severance Agreement if his employment is terminated without cause or if he terminates his employment with good reason. The magnitude of the payments and benefits is dependent upon whether or not the termination was upon or within 24 months following a change in control (referred to as a "change in control termination" if occurring within that 24 month period).
Change in Control Related Payments
In the event of a change in control termination, Mr. Wine is entitled to receive:
Non-Change in Control Termination Related Payments
In the case of a termination without cause or with good reason not in connection with a change in control, Mr. Wine is entitled to receive:
The amount of payments and benefits under the Wine Severance Agreement and the PRSU awards are detailed in the table appearing under the caption "Potential Payments to Mr. Wine" on page 40. As a condition to receiving payments and benefits under the severance agreement, Mr. Wine must execute a general waiver and release of any claims against the Company. The Wine Severance Agreement also provides that during and for a period of (i) 60 months following termination, Mr. Wine is prohibited from using or disclosing our proprietary information, except as required by his duties to Polaris and (ii) two years following termination, Mr. Wine must refrain from working for or acquiring an ownership interest (other than an interest of up to 1% of publicly held securities) in our competitors, or soliciting our employees.
Severance Agreements with Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel
Change in Control Related Payments
We have entered into severance agreements with Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel which provide that if upon or within 24 months after a change in control, any of such Named Executive Officers terminates employment for good reason or if his or her employment is terminated by the Company without cause, then the Named Executive Officer will be entitled to:
No cash incentive award will be paid for any part of the fiscal year in which the termination occurs.
Non-Change in Control Termination Related Payments
Under the severance agreements, a non-change in control termination is deemed to occur if the Named Executive Officer is terminated by the Company without cause other than in connection with a change in control. In the event of a non-change in control termination, the Named Executive Officer will be entitled to:
The amounts payable to each Named Executive Officer under the severance agreements and PRSU awards are quantified in the tables appearing under the caption "Potential Payments to Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel" on page 41.
Equity Award Agreements
Mr. Wine's stock option award agreements provide for full, accelerated vesting of all unvested options if employment is terminated due to death or disability or after normal retirement age. For those stock options granted to him after May 2015, vesting will accelerate in full upon a change a control only if the options are not continued, assumed or replaced or if Mr. Wine experiences a termination of employment within one year for reasons other than cause or for good reason. Under Mr. Wine's PRSU award agreements, vesting will accelerate as to the same percentages of units in connection with a change in control only if the PRSU awards are not continued, assumed or replaced or if Mr. Wine experiences a termination of employment within one year without cause or for good reason. In addition, if Mr. Wine is terminated by the Company without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason other than in connection with a change in control, he will be entitled to have vest, at the end of the performance period, a pro rata portion of the units that would otherwise be deemed to have been earned during the performance period. The prorated portion of the earned payout is based on the amount of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date of termination following the change in control. The balance of the award is forfeited.
The stock option award agreements for Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel provide for full, accelerated vesting of options if employment is terminated due to death or disability or after retirement age. Stock options granted to Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel provide for full, accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control only if the options are not continued, assumed or replaced or if they experience a termination of employment without cause or for good reason within one year. The PRSU award agreements for these individuals provide for accelerated vesting of the awards under the same circumstances and to the same degree as described above for Mr. Wine. Time-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control only if the awards are not continued or if the Named Executive Officer is terminated within one year without cause or for good reason. For Mr. Musso, his time-based restricted stock unit award will vest if he experiences an involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason not in connection with a change in control.
Under the equity award agreements, a Named Executive Officer will be considered to have been terminated without cause or to have terminated his employment for good reason under the same circumstances as described above in connection with the Named Executive Officers' severance arrangements.
The amounts payable to Mr. Wine under the equity award agreements are quantified in the table appearing under the caption "Potential Payments to Mr. Wine" on page 40, and the amounts payable to the other Named Executive Officers are quantified in the table appearing under the caption "Potential Payments to Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel" on page 41.
Payments Made Upon Retirement
We maintain the 401(k) Plan and the restorative SERP, as explained in the section entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018" on page 35. We do not maintain a defined benefit pension plan or a defined benefit supplemental pension plan for our Named Executive Officers.
We do, however, provide certain benefits and perquisites to Named Executive Officers that are retirement-eligible. These benefits and perquisites include:
We also provide certain retirement benefits to Named Executive Officers who have attained the age of at least 55 and have a minimum of 10 years of service to our Company. These benefits include the same benefits available at full retirement age described above, except that for Mr. Wine, all outstanding stock options granted prior to 2016 that have not yet vested are forfeited.
Mr. Pucel is also eligible for an additional payment equal to three times his annual base salary upon retirement on or after age 55 plus five years of service. Mr. Pucel received this benefit as part of an inducement to join Polaris and as a substitute to a comparable benefit he received from his prior employer.
None of the Named Executive Officers has attained the age of 55 and had at least 10 years of service (or 5 years with respect to Mr. Pucel) at the Company as of December 31, 2018.
Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Agreements
As described in "Severance, Proprietary Information and Noncompetition Agreement with Mr. Wine" on page 36, Mr. Wine has agreed not to engage in competitive activities or solicit employees for a period of two years following his termination of employment. The other Named Executive Officers were required to enter into non-competition agreements as a condition to the receipt of certain equity grants, under which they agree to not engage in competitive activities or soliciting employees for a period of eighteen months following their termination of employment.
Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers Upon Termination
The following tables quantify the amounts and benefits payable to the Named Executive Officers upon termination under various scenarios. In calculating the payments set forth in such tables, we have assumed that (i) the date of termination was December  31, 2018, the last business day of fiscal year 2018, and (ii) the stock price was $76.68 per share, the closing market price of our common stock on such date. The tables do not reflect payments and benefits that are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination, including:
The tables also do not reflect amounts attributable to vested, non-forfeitable equity-based awards (see "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" on page 33), or distributions of plan balances under the SERP (see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2018" on page 35). In addition, the tables do not reflect any applicable tax withholdings or other deductions by the Company from the amounts otherwise payable to the Named Executive Officers upon termination of employment. To the extent applicable, the present value of the payments presented in the tables below was calculated using a discount rate of 5%.
We provide a number of lifetime benefits and perquisites to our Named Executive Officers upon retirement or receipt of early retirement benefits. For purposes of quantifying the value of such benefits and perquisites in the tables below, we have used an average life expectancy age of 78 for such individuals. The costs of medical and dental coverage are based on current annual premiums multiplied by the number of years between the executive officer's age and 78 for those that receive it until then. Company parts, garments and accessories coverage is based on the average spent for the Named Executive Officers in 2018 multiplied by the number of years between the executive officer's age and 78 (for those who receive it).
Potential Payments to Mr. Wine
Potential Payments to Mr. Speetzen, Ms. Clark Dougherty, and Messrs. Musso and Pucel
Pay Ratio Disclosure
As a result of rules adopted by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), beginning for fiscal years starting January 1, 2017, the SEC requires disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to that our CEO. The Company's CEO is Mr. Wine, our Chairman and CEO.
As of October 1, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 11,081 individuals, of which approximately 7,500 or 68% were working in the United States, 3,584 or 32% were working outside of the United States. Given the logistical difficulties and significant difference in the composition of total compensation in our operations in India and China, we elected to exclude all of our employees in India (81 employees) and China (124 employees) from our determination of the median employee. The median employee was selected from an adjusted employee population of approximately 10,876.
The median employee was identified using gross wages including overtime, vacation, jury duty, sick time paid during the nine-month period from January 1, 2017 to October 1, 2017, and excluded any variable compensation such as equity awards, bonuses, commissions, and allowances for items such as cell phones and cars for employees which are not widely distributed throughout the employee population. Wages paid in foreign currencies were converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of October 1, 2017.
For 2018, there were no material changes to the Company's employee population or compensation arrangements that would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure and warrant calculating a new median employee.
The annual total compensation for the median employee was calculated using the same methodology used for our named executive officers as set forth on the Summary Compensation Table on page 27. This resulted in the median employee's annual total compensation in 2018 as shown below.   
Based on this information for fiscal year 2018, we reasonably estimate that the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 173:1. Our pay ratio estimate has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
Director Compensation
The following table sets forth the compensation earned by each of the non-employee directors for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Non-Employee Directors — Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock awards for each of the non-employee directors as of December 31, 2018.
Director Fees
Directors who are employees of our Company receive no compensation for their services as directors or as members of committees. Compensation for non-employee directors is divided into cash and stock components. We presently pay each non-employee director an annual director's retainer of $85,000. The Lead Director of the Board receives an annual Lead Director retainer of $30,000. The annual director retainers have remained unchanged since 2013. The Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee receives an annual committee chairman's fee of $10,000, the Chairs of the Compensation Committee and Technology Committee receive an annual committee chairman's fee of $15,000, and the Chair of the Audit Committee receives an annual committee chairman's fee of $20,000. We pay committee members an annual fee for committee membership which is: $10,000 for Audit Committee members; $7,500 for Compensation Committee members; $5,000 for Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee members; and $2,500 for Technology Committee members. Any non-employee director may elect to defer the receipt of all or a specified portion of the retainer and fee payments specified in this paragraph under the Deferred Compensation Plan (as described below).
Deferred Compensation Plan
We maintain the Deferred Compensation Plan for non-employee directors. A non-employee director can defer all or a portion of the retainer and fee payments that would otherwise be paid to him or her in cash. Such deferred amounts are converted into additional common stock equivalents based on the then fair market value of the common stock. Each common stock equivalent represents the economic equivalent of one share of common stock. Dividend equivalents are credited to non-employee directors as if the common stock equivalents are outstanding shares of common stock. Such dividend equivalents are deemed invested in additional common stock equivalents.
As soon as practicable after a non-employee director's service on the Board terminates, he or she will receive a distribution of a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of common stock equivalents then credited to him or her under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Upon the death of a non-employee director, the shares will be issued to his or her beneficiary. Shares of common stock issued for common stock equivalents and dividend equivalents are issued under the Omnibus Plan. Upon a change in control of our Company (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan), each non-employee director will receive a cash payment equal to the value of his or her accumulated common stock equivalents.
Deferred Stock Units
Since 2007, we have granted our non-employee directors an annual award of deferred stock units in an amount determined by the Board. The deferred stock units are issued under the Omnibus Plan and are fully vested upon issuance. Upon termination of service as a director or upon an earlier change in control of our Company, each non-employee director will receive one share of common stock for every deferred stock unit credited to the non-employee director's account. Dividend equivalents are credited to non-employee directors as if the deferred stock units are outstanding shares of common stock. Such dividend equivalents are deemed invested in additional deferred stock units.
Use of Polaris Products
We provide each of the non-employee directors with the use of up to eight Polaris products, of his or her choice, at no charge to encourage a first-hand understanding of the riding experience of our customers and to provide the non-employee directors with an opportunity to evaluate product design and efficiency. The products used by the non-employee directors can be returned to the Company or purchased at a price greater than cost at the end of a defined usage period based upon months, miles or hours, depending upon the product line. We sell the returned products to dealers at an amount greater than the cost of such products to the Company. All non-employee directors also receive related parts, garments, accessories, and services at no cost.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines, which provide that each non-employee director is expected to own, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock, common stock equivalents and deferred stock units having a value of at least three times the amount of the annual retainer. Compliance with the stock ownership guidelines is voluntary, but is monitored by our CFO. All non-employee directors are expected to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines within four years following the date they are first elected to the Board. Currently, all directors are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Our shareholders have approved our 1995 Stock Option Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, and Omnibus Plan. Awards may currently be made only under the Omnibus Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
We do not have any equity compensation plans outstanding that have not been approved by shareholders.
Summary Table
The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2018, with respect to compensation plans under which shares of our common stock may be issued.
Introduction
Our Board, on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, approved on February 28, 2019 an amendment and restatement of the Polaris Industries Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), subject to shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The proposed amendment and restatement would, among other things discussed below, add an additional 3,325,000 shares to the Plan share reserve. As of March 1, 2019, there were approximately 183,297 shares of our common stock remaining available for future awards under the Plan, which is the Company's only equity-based compensation plan under which awards may be made.
The Plan was originally approved by our shareholders on April 19, 2007, and replaced our 1995 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan, Restricted Stock Plan and 2003 Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan (the "Prior Plans"). No awards are outstanding under any of the Prior Plans, and no additional awards may be granted under any of the Prior Plans.
The table below shows, as of March 1, 2019, the shares reserved for issuance under awards outstanding under the Plan and the Prior Plans, shares available for future awards under the Plan, and shares to be added to the Plan if the amendment and restatement is approved by our shareholders.
Shareholder Approval and Board Recommendation
Shareholder approval of the Plan is being sought in order to (i) satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of the NYSE and (ii) obtain shareholder approval of the number of shares that may be subject to incentive stock options under Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 422.
The Board believes that it is both necessary and appropriate to further increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan in order to enable the Company to continue offering meaningful equity-based incentives to key employees and non-employee directors. Therefore the Board recommends that our shareholders vote FOR the Plan. Unless a contrary choice is specified, proxies solicited by the Board will be voted FOR approval of the Plan. If the proposed amendment and restatement of the Plan is approved by the shareholders, it will take effect as of April 25, 2019. If the proposed amendment and restatement is not approved, the Plan will remain in effect as it existed immediately prior to the proposed amendment and restatement.
Principal Changes to the Existing Plan
The principal changes to the existing Plan that are reflected in the proposed amendment and restatement are the following:
The proposed amendment and restatement of the Plan also includes other administrative or clarifying changes.
Factors Considered in Setting Size of Requested Share Reserve Increase
In determining the number of shares by which to increase the pool of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan, we considered a number of factors, including the following:
Key Compensation Practices Reflected in the Plan
The Plan as proposed to be amended and restated includes a number of features that we believe are consistent with the interests of our shareholders and sound corporate governance practices, including the following:
Summary of the Amended and Restated Plan
The major features of the Plan as proposed to be amended and restated are summarized below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended and restated Plan, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.
Plan Purpose
The Plan is intended to advance the interests of our Company and its shareholders by enabling the Company and our affiliated entities to attract and retain qualified individuals through opportunities for equity participation in our Company, and to reward those individuals who contribute to the achievement of our financial and strategic business goals through incentive compensation.
Administration
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine, within the limits of the express provisions of the Plan, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, the nature, amount and terms of such awards and the objectives and conditions for earning such awards. The Compensation Committee may also establish subplans and modify the terms of award agreements to the extent necessary to comply with local laws in connection with awards made to participants outside of the United States. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Compensation Committee has discretion to delegate its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee, to executive officers (with respect to awards to participants who are not directors or executive officers) or, in connection with nondiscretionary administrative duties, to other parties as it deems appropriate.
Except in connection with equity restructurings and other situations in which share adjustments are specifically authorized, the Plan prohibits the Compensation Committee from repricing any outstanding "underwater" option or SAR without prior approval of our shareholders. For these purposes, "repricing" includes amending the terms of an underwater option or SAR to lower the exercise price, or canceling an underwater option or SAR in exchange for replacement options or SARs having a lower exercise price, for other forms of awards, or for cash or other property.
Available Shares
A maximum of 24,325,000 shares of our common stock are available for issuance under the Plan, plus the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans as of the date the Plan was originally adopted that subsequently expire or are forfeited or settled in cash (the "forfeited award shares"). The pool of shares available for issuance under the Plan may be used for all types of equity awards available under the Plan, which include stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and other stock-based awards, as described in more detail below. The shares of common stock covered by the Plan are authorized but unissued shares.
Shares of common stock that are issued under the Plan or that are potentially issuable pursuant to outstanding awards will reduce the maximum number of shares remaining available for issuance under the Plan by one share for each share issued or issuable pursuant to an option or SAR award, and by three shares for each share issued or issuable pursuant to a full-value award.
Any shares of common stock subject to an award under the Plan, or to an award under any of the Prior Plans that is outstanding on the date the Plan was originally adopted, that expires, is forfeited, or is settled or exchanged for cash will, to the extent of such expiration, forfeiture, settlement or exchange, automatically again become available for issuance under the Plan. Each share that again becomes available for issuance will increase the Plan's share reserve by the same number of shares by which the share reserve was decreased when the award was first granted. However, any shares tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with any award, any shares we repurchase using option exercise proceeds and any shares subject to a SAR that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the SAR on its exercise may not be used again for new grants.
Awards granted under the Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding equity awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the Company or any of our affiliates (referred to as "substitute awards") will not reduce the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan. Additionally, if a company acquired by the Company or any of our affiliates has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of that pre-existing plan may be used for awards under the Plan and will not reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan, but only if the shares are used for awards made to individuals who were not employed by or providing services to the Company or any of our affiliates immediately prior to such acquisition.
Share Adjustment Provisions
If certain transactions with our shareholders occur that cause the per share value of our common stock to change, such as stock splits, spin-offs, stock dividends or certain recapitalizations (referred to as "equity restructurings"), the Compensation Committee will equitably adjust (i) the class of shares issuable and the maximum number and kind of shares subject to the Plan, (ii) outstanding awards as to the class, number of shares and exercise price per share, and (iii) award limitations prescribed by the Plan. Other types of transactions may also affect the common stock, such as reorganizations, mergers or consolidations. If there is such a transaction and the Compensation Committee determines that adjustments of the type previously described in connection with equity restructurings would be appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Plan, the Compensation Committee will make such adjustments as it deems equitable.
Eligible Participants
The Compensation Committee may grant awards to any employee, non-employee director, consultant or other person providing services to the Company or our affiliates. Currently, there were approximately 12,000 persons employed by or otherwise in the service of our Company and our affiliates, including nine non-employee directors, who would be eligible to receive awards under the Plan.
Types of Awards
Awards under the Plan may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards.
Stock Options
The Compensation Committee may grant to participants options to purchase our common stock that qualify as incentive stock options for purposes of Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options"), options that do not qualify as incentive stock options ("non-qualified stock options") or a combination thereof. The terms and conditions of stock option grants, including the number of shares, exercise price, vesting periods, and other conditions on exercise, will be determined by the Compensation Committee. All of the 3,325,000 shares being added to the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan may be issued as incentive stock options.
The per share exercise price for stock options will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion, but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date when the stock option is granted (except in the case of substitute awards described above). Additionally, in the case of incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the date of grant, the exercise price may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date the stock option is granted. On March 1, 2019, the fair market value of a share of our common stock was $87.42 based on the closing sale price of our common stock on the NYSE on such date.
Stock options must be exercised within a period fixed by the Compensation Committee that may not exceed ten years from the date of grant, except that in the case of incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the date of grant, the exercise period may not exceed five years. No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited with respect to shares subject to an option award.
At the Compensation Committee's discretion, payment for shares of common stock on the exercise of stock options may be made in cash, in shares of our common stock held by the participant, by withholding a number of shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise of the option, or in any manner acceptable to the Compensation Committee (including one or more forms of broker-assisted "cashless" exercise).
Stock Appreciation Rights
The Compensation Committee may grant to a participant an award of SARs, which entitles the participant to receive, upon its exercise, a payment equal to (i) the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the exercise date over the SAR exercise price, times (ii) the number of shares of common stock with respect to which the SAR is exercised. The payment upon exercise of a SAR may be in cash, shares of common stock, or any combination thereof, as approved by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.
The per share exercise price for a SAR will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion, but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date when the SAR is granted (except in the case of substitute awards described above). SARs must be exercised within a period fixed by the Compensation Committee that may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited with respect to shares subject to a SAR award.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The Compensation Committee may award to a participant shares of common stock subject to specified restrictions ("restricted stock"). Shares of restricted stock are subject to forfeiture if specified vesting conditions, such as continued employment over a specified vesting period and/or the attainment of specified performance objectives over a specified performance period, are not satisfied. Any dividends or distributions payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unvested portion of a restricted stock award will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the shares to which such dividends or distributions relate.
The Compensation Committee also may award to a participant restricted stock units, each representing the right to receive in the future, in cash and/or shares of our common stock as determined by the Compensation Committee, the fair market value of a share of common stock. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture if specified vesting conditions, such as continued employment over a specified vesting period and/or the attainment of specified performance objectives over a specified performance period, are not satisfied. The terms and conditions of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may provide for the payment of dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards but any such dividend equivalents will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying units to which such dividend equivalents relate.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The Compensation Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related awards, referred to as "other stock-based awards," other than options, SARs, restricted stock or restricted stock units. The terms and conditions of each other stock-based award will be determined by the Compensation Committee. Payment under any other stock-based awards will be made in common stock or cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may provide for the payment of dividend equivalents on other stock-based awards but any such dividend equivalents will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying share equivalents to which such dividend equivalents relate.
Minimum Vesting Requirements
Awards that vest based solely on the satisfaction by the participant of service-based vesting conditions shall be subject to a vesting period of not less than one year from the applicable date of grant. Awards whose vesting is subject to the satisfaction of performance goals shall be subject to a performance period of not less than one year. These minimum vesting and performance periods will not apply, however, (i) upon a change in control, (ii) upon termination of employment due to death, disability or retirement, (iii) to a substitute award that does not reduce the vesting period of the award being replaced, and (iv) to awards involving an aggregate number of shares not in excess of 5% of the share reserve under the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
The Compensation Committee may at any time amend, terminate or modify the Plan or any award agreement issued thereunder. No such action may be taken that adversely affects in any material way any award previously granted under the Plan without the consent of the participant, except for amendments necessary to comply with applicable laws or stock exchange rules. In addition, no material amendment of the Plan may be made without shareholder approval if shareholder approval is required by law, regulation, or stock exchange rules, and no "underwater" option or SAR may be repriced in any manner (except for anti-dilution adjustments) without shareholder approval (see "Administration" above). In no event may any awards be made under the Plan after April 25, 2029.
Change in Control of the Company
If a change in control of our Company that involves a corporate transaction occurs, then the consequences will be as described in this paragraph unless the Compensation Committee provides otherwise in an applicable award agreement. If any outstanding award is continued, assumed or replaced by the surviving or successor entity in connection with such corporate transaction, and if within one year after the change in control a participant's employment or other service is involuntarily terminated without cause, then (i) each of the participant's outstanding options and SARs will become exercisable in full and remain exercisable for one year, and (ii) each of the participant's other unvested awards will fully vest. To the extent vesting of any award is subject to satisfaction of specified performance goals, such award shall be deemed "fully vested" if the performance goals are deemed to have been satisfied at the target level of performance. If any outstanding award is not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a change in control involving a corporate transaction, then (i) all outstanding options and SARs will become fully exercisable for a period of time prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction and will then terminate at the effective time of the corporate transaction, and (ii) all other awards will fully vest immediately prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction (with awards subject to satisfaction of specified performance goals vesting at the target level of performance). Alternatively, the Compensation Committee may elect to terminate awards in exchange for a payment with respect to each award in an amount equal to the excess, if any, between the fair market value of the shares subject to the award immediately prior to the effective date of such corporate transaction (which may be the fair market value of the consideration to be received in the corporate transaction for the same number of shares) over the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the shares subject to such award (or, if there is no excess, such award may be terminated without payment).
If a change in control of our Company that does not involve a corporate transaction occurs, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding awards, which may include providing for the cancellation of any award in exchange for payments in a manner similar to that provided above in connection with a corporate transaction, or making such adjustments to the awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such change in control, which may include the acceleration of vesting in full or in part. The Committee will not be required to treat all awards similarly in such circumstances. For purposes of the Plan, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Deferral of Payouts
The Compensation Committee may permit or require the deferral by a participant of the receipt of shares or cash in settlement of any full-value award under the Plan, and will prescribe the terms, conditions and procedures for such deferrals.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences to the Company and to participants subject to U.S. taxation with respect to awards granted under the Plan, based on current statutes, regulations and interpretations.
Non-qualified Stock Options
If a participant is granted a non-qualified stock option under the Plan, the participant will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of the option. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired at the time of exercise and the exercise price paid. The participant's basis in the common stock for purposes of determining gain or loss on a subsequent sale or disposition of such shares generally will be the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option was exercised. Any subsequent gain or loss will be taxable as a capital gain or loss. The Company will generally be entitled to a federal income tax deduction at the time and for the same amount as the participant recognizes as ordinary income, subject to Code Section 162(m) with respect to covered employees.
Incentive Stock Options
If a participant is granted an incentive stock option under the Plan, the participant will not recognize taxable income upon grant of the option. Additionally, if applicable holding period requirements (a minimum of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise) are met, the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise. However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired at the time of exercise over the aggregate exercise price is an item of tax preference income potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax. If shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option are held for the holding period described above, the gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition of the shares will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will not be entitled to any deduction. Except in the event of death, if the holding period requirements are not met, the incentive stock option will be treated as one that does not meet the requirements of the Code for incentive stock options and the tax consequences described for nonqualified stock options will generally apply.
Other Awards
The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the Plan generally follow certain basic patterns. An award of restricted stock results in income recognition by a participant in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received at the time the restrictions lapse and the shares vest, unless the participant elects under Code Section 83(b) to accelerate income recognition and the taxability of the award to the date of grant. Restricted stock unit awards generally result in income recognition by a participant at the time payment of such an award is made in an amount equal to the amount paid in cash or the then-current fair market value of the shares received, as applicable. SAR awards result in income recognition by a participant at the time such an award is exercised in an amount equal to the amount paid in cash or the then-current fair market value of the shares received by the participant, as applicable. In each of the foregoing cases, the Company will generally have a corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to Code Section 162(m) with respect to covered employees.
Section 162(m) of the Code
Code Section 162(m) denies a deduction to any publicly-held corporation for compensation paid to certain "covered employees" in a taxable year to the extent that compensation to the covered employee exceeds $1,000,000.
Section 409A of the Code
The foregoing discussion of tax consequences of awards under the Plan assumes that the award discussed is either not considered a "deferred compensation arrangement" subject to Section 409A of the Code, or has been structured to comply with its requirements. If an award is considered a deferred compensation arrangement subject to Section 409A but fails to comply, in operation or form, with the requirements of Section 409A, the affected participant would generally be required to include in income when the award vests the amount deemed "deferred," would be required to pay an additional 20% income tax on such amount, and would be required to pay interest on the tax that would have been paid but for the deferral.
New Plan Awards
No awards will be made under the Plan as proposed to be amended and restated until after it has been approved by our shareholders. Because all awards under the Plan are within the discretion of the Compensation Committee, neither the number nor types of future Plan awards to be received by or allocated to particular participants or groups of participants are presently determinable.
The Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, unanimously recommends a vote FOR the proposal to approve the Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
The Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, and the Board is asking shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules and regulations, as well as the Audit Committee Charter require our independent registered public accounting firm to be engaged, retained, and supervised by the Audit Committee, the Board considers the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter of shareholder concern and considers a proposal for shareholders to ratify such selection to be an opportunity for shareholders to provide direct feedback to the Board on a significant issue of corporate governance.
If the selection of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit Committee will review its future selection of an independent registered public accounting firm in the light of that vote result.
Representatives of EY will be present at the virtual Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee reports to and acts on behalf of the Board by providing oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, (3) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (4) the independent registered public accounting firm's performance, qualifications and independence and (5) the responsibilities, performance, budget and staffing of our internal audit function. The Audit Committee is comprised of five directors, all of whom meet the standards of independence adopted by the SEC and the NYSE.
In performing the Audit Committee oversight responsibilities, we have reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and with representatives of EY, our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviewed, and discussed with management and representatives of EY, management's assessment and report and EY's report and attestation on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") standards. The Audit Committee has received from our independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communication with the audit committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the independence of EY with representatives of such firm. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the non-audit services provided to us by the independent registered public accounting firm are compatible with maintaining their independence.
Management is responsible for our system of internal controls and the financial reporting process. EY is responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to in this Report, the Audit Committee recommends to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Audit Fees
The aggregate audit fees paid to EY for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $2,834,000 and $2,398,000, respectively. These fees include amounts for the annual audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, statutory audits at certain foreign subsidiaries, the reviews of the consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and certain accounting consultation services surrounding acquisition activities.
Audit-Related Fees
The aggregate audit-related fees paid to EY for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $72,000 and $69,000, respectively. These fees represent amounts reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the consolidated financial statements that are not reported under the Audit Fees category such as the audit of employee benefit plans, the issuance of certain industry reports, and access to certain research tools.
Tax Fees
The aggregate fees billed by EY for tax services rendered for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $117,000 and $329,000, respectively. These fees were primarily related to tax planning and compliance services, including assistance related to certain foreign subsidiaries, and potential transactions.
All Other Fees
No other fees were billed by EY for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Requirements
The Audit Committee's charter provides that it has the sole authority to review in advance and grant any pre-approvals of (i) all auditing services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, (ii) all significant non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm as permitted by Section 10A of the Exchange Act and the PCAOB and (iii) all fees and the terms of engagement with respect to such services. All audit and non-audit services performed by EY during fiscal 2018 were pre-approved pursuant to the procedures outlined above.
General Information
We are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), our executive compensation philosophy and programs align executive compensation decisions with our desired business direction, strategy and performance. The primary objectives and priorities of the compensation program include:
Our shareholders have a right to cast an advisory vote on our executive compensation program at the Annual Meeting. As a result, we are presenting this proposal, which gives you, as a shareholder, the opportunity to vote on the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Polaris Industries Inc. Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related disclosure contained in this Proxy Statement."
The Board urges shareholders to endorse the compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers by voting "FOR" the resolution.
As discussed in the CD&A contained in this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee of the Board believes that the executive compensation provided for 2018 is reasonable and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Compensation for the year is established in January and is guided by the prior year performance as well as projections for the forthcoming year. In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board advises you to consider our pay for performance philosophy coupled with the factors related to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018, each of which is discussed in the CD&A.
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board and will not overrule any decision by the Board or require the Board to take any action. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will carefully review the voting results. To the extent there is any significant negative vote on this proposal, we may consult directly with shareholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote. The Board and the Compensation Committee would consider constructive feedback obtained through this process in making future decisions about executive compensation programs.
The Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, unanimously recommends a vote FOR approval of the resolution to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February 15, 2019 by each person known to us who then beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, each director, each nominee for director, each Named Executive Officer named in the Summary Compensation Table appearing below and all current executive officers and directors as a group. As of February 15, 2019, there were 60,960,872 shares of common stock outstanding. Except as otherwise indicated, the named beneficial owner has sole voting and investment powers with respect to the shares held by such beneficial owner. The table also includes information with respect to common stock equivalents and deferred stock units credited as of February 15, 2019 to the accounts of each director as described in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Director Compensation."
Questions and Answers about the Annual Meeting and Voting
If you are a street-name shareholder (meaning that your shares are registered in the name of your bank or broker), you will receive instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee describing how to vote your shares.
Whichever method you use, the proxies identified on the proxy will vote the shares of which you are the shareholder of record in accordance with your instructions. If you submit a proxy without giving specific voting instructions, the proxies will vote those shares as recommended by the Board.
Other Matters
The Board is not aware of any matters that are expected to come before the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement. If any other matter should come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote the proxies in accordance with their best judgment.
Submission of Shareholder Proposals and Nominations
Under the rules of the SEC, if a shareholder wants the Company to include a proposal in our Proxy Statement and form of proxy for presentation at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proposal must be submitted in writing and received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices by November 12, 2019. The proposal must comply with the rules of the SEC and our bylaws, which are described below. If a shareholder intends to introduce an item of business or nominate a person as a director at the 2020 Annual Meeting, without including the proposal or nomination in the Proxy Statement, we must receive notice of that intention no later than January 26, 2020.
A shareholder's notice to the Company must include the information required by our bylaws, including, if the item of business does not relate to the nomination of a person to serve as a director, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting the business at the meeting, any material interest of the shareholder or any associated person of the shareholder in the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the name and address of the shareholder and any associated person of the shareholder as they appear on our books, and specified information regarding the shareholder's interests in our capital stock. A shareholder's notice to the Company of the nomination of a person to serve as a director must include, as applicable, similar information as required above, as well as the name of any director nominee, information about the nominee required by SEC rules and the director nominee's consent to be named and serve if elected.
Additional Information
Householding
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called householding, which allows us to deliver a single set of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the Annual Report to Shareholders (together, the "Annual Report"), Proxy Statement or Notice to shareholders who do not participate in electronic delivery and have the same last name and address. This process helps eliminate duplicate mailings and reduces our printing and mailing costs.
If your household would like to receive individual rather than multiple mailings in the future, please write to Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Englewood, New York 11717, or call 800-542-1061. If a broker or other nominee holds your shares, you may continue to receive multiple mailings. Please contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue multiple mailings from them.
Your household may have received a single set of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement; if you would like another set, please write to Broadridge Investor Communications Solutions at the address above.

Annex A
Polaris Industries Inc.
2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan
(As Amended and Restated April 25, 2019)
Whenever used in this Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, and when the meaning is intended, the initial letter of the word shall be capitalized.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Award constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Code Section 409A, and if that Award provides for a change in the time or form of payment upon a Change in Control, then no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon an event described in Section 2.6 unless the event would also constitute a change in ownership or effective control of, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company under Code Section 409A.
Each Participant under this Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Plan is to be paid in case of his death before he receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such beneficiary designation, benefits remaining unpaid or rights remaining unexercised at the Participant's death shall be paid or exercised by the Participant's executor, administrator, or legal representative.
The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for, or in connection with the assumption of, existing awards granted or issued by another entity and assumed or otherwise agreed to be provided for by the Company pursuant to or by reason of a transaction involving a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation to which the Company or an Affiliate is a party. The terms and conditions of the Substitute Awards may vary from the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan to the extent that the Committee at the time of the grant may deem appropriate to conform, in whole or in part, to the provisions of the awards in substitution for which they are granted.
All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate applicable law.
