2019 Proxy Statement and Notice of Annual Meeting 
March 29, 2019 
Dear Fellow Stockholders: 
Please join my fellow directors and me at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which will be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019, at our corporate headquarters in Port Washington, New York. The business we will conduct at the meeting is described in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement. 
A famous aphorism ascribed to the economist John Maynard Keynes states that "the market can remain irrational longer than most investors can remain solvent." This irrationality was very much in evidence at the end of December 2018 when we successfully sold a lower-half rated asset at approximately a 7% cap rate, at the same time that our entire company was being valued at a 9.5% cap rate. Indeed, at year-end 2018 our stock was trading at a price that constituted roughly a 50% discount to our consensus net asset value (NAV). 
In the face of this dissonance, we forged ahead with announcing and successfully executing a share repurchase funded by the proceeds of our asset sale. I am proud that Cedar has the distinction of being among a very select group of REIT management teams that have, over the last five years, consistently issued equity when trading at a premium to consensus NAV and repurchased shares with the proceeds of lower-half asset sales, when trading at a discount to consensus NAV. This is textbook REIT capital allocation, which we believe is our duty as responsible stewards of shareholder capital. The chart below shows our capital raises from 2014-2018: 
Source: SNL as of December 31, 2018. 
At the same time, along with all other shareholders I lament the underperformance of our stock during 2018, even if I believe it is irrational. We at Cedar continue to forge ahead resolute in the conviction that our corporate goal of being counted among the best-in-class shopping center REITs remains within reach and that 2019 represents an inflection point in reaching that goal. 
In 2019, we anticipate breaking ground on at least one of our three major urban mixed-use redevelopment projects, two of which are in Philadelphia and one in Washington, D.C. As a relatively small REIT, our ambitious goal of being considered among the best-in-class is supported by a strategy to evolve our urban assets into premiere mixed-use assets. Over the coming quarters and years, we anticipate methodically executing on these redevelopments, announcing anchor lease signings, ground breakings, progress reports and stabilizations, in what we ultimately believe will result in attractive returns and significant shareholder value creation. I cannot say at what point in our execution the market will celebrate our accomplishments and reward us with an improved share price. I am confident, however, that in systematically and accretively migrating our capital into better assets and markets, we will grow the warranted value of Cedar. 
I thank you for your continued interest in and support of Cedar Realty Trust. As a meaningful shareholder myself, I am constantly reminded of the challenges REITs such as ours face in today's capital markets. At the same time, I am optimistic for the future of this company due to Cedar's unique strategy for value creation being executed by our terrific team.

Executive Compensation Matters (Page 29) 
We give our stockholders an annual vote on our executive compensation program and are requesting your support for the compensation of our named executive officers as described on pages 29 through 55 of this Proxy Statement. This is an advisory vote, so the results will not be binding on the Company, but the Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote as part of its ongoing review of executive compensation. The goals of our executive compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain and motivate talented executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of the Company and our stockholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• incentivize our executive officers based on clearly defined performance goals and measures of successful achievement; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align market competitive compensation with our short- and long-term performance.  
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee determines the form and amount of compensation, as well as the overall structure of our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultants used to assist in establishing compensation for our executive officers and to approve such consultants' fees and other retention terms. The Compensation Committee has engaged Mercer (US) Inc. ("Mercer"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC"), as its independent compensation consultant. 
Our executive compensation for 2018 was built on a purposeful foundation of corporate governance and desire to emulate best market practices. Our named executive officers' base salaries remained the same as compared with 2017. Annual bonus incentive was determined based on a combination of Company and individual performance: 70% of each executive's bonus was determined based on the Company's achievement of its targeted Operating FFO, and 30% was based on qualitative individual performance evaluations for each of those executives. For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to award our CEO, CFO and COO annual bonuses of $720,000, $342,000 and $342,000, respectively, which corresponded to 90% of each of their respective target amounts. 
4  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
We believe that awarding senior executives a significant amount of their compensation in the form of equity incentive awards best accomplishes desired alignment between pay and performance and ensures that management's incentives are geared toward long-term stockholder value creation. 
Please refer to the table on page 33 of this Proxy Statement for a more detailed description of our compensation policies and programs. 
Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote (Page 34) 
Our stockholders have consistently supported our executive compensation program. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted in favor with approximately 98% support approving our resolution seeking advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers. While we have enjoyed solid stockholder support for our executive compensation program over the years, we continue to engage in dialogue with stockholders on executive compensation issues, particularly in 2018, a named executive officer contract renewal year. 
Integrating feedback we have received from stockholders over the past several years, our Compensation Committee redesigned significant features of our CEO's and CFO's compensation as governed by their respective new employment agreements, effective as of June 2018, upon the expiration of their prior contracts. Among other features, the new employment agreements provide for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a $50,000 reduction in annual CEO base pay and, consequently, a reduced bonus which is indexed on base pay, beginning in  2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perpetuation of "double trigger" condition for payment of cash severance following a Change in Control, a  modification previously introduced in response to stockholder feedback;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• subjecting CEO's dividend equivalent rights to forfeiture unless and until performance-based restricted stock units  are earned;

As evidence of our pay/performance alignment, as a result of performance targets based on total shareholder return ("TSR") not having been met at the end of the performance period as defined in Mr. Schanzer's prior employment agreement, in June 2018, under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Schanzer forfeited 1,250,000 shares of restricted stock, with a value of approximately $5.5 million as of the date of forfeiture. 
Please refer to pages 48-51 of this Proxy Statement for a more complete description of key features of our new CEO and CFO employment contracts. 
Amendment of Our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (Page 68) 
At our Annual Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2,000,000 shares, from 4,000,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares (the "Plan Amendment"). The Plan Amendment was approved by the Board on February 5, 2019, subject to stockholder approval of Proposal 4 at the Annual Meeting. The Plan Amendment is intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of directors, officers, and employees upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of the Company's operations are largely dependent. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  5 
The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was initially adopted by our Board on March 14, 2017 and approved by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan includes the following stockholder-friendly provisions: 
However, the stock prices of publicly traded shopping center REITs have declined significantly over the past 12 to 18 months, including our stock price. A consequence of this unanticipated decline has been that in order to provide equity grants to key employees commensurate with years prior to the decline as part of their compensation package, we have made, and will be required to make, equity grants covering significantly more shares than originally contemplated at the time the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was adopted two years ago. The Board has thus determined that the current equity share pool reserve under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan will not be sufficient for our anticipated equity award needs into 2020 and beyond. Therefore, if stockholders do not approve the Plan Amendment, our future ability to issue equity-based awards will be limited, which could have significant negative consequences on our ability to recruit and retain qualified senior employees. If approved by stockholders, no portion of the additional 2,000,000 shares reserved under the Plan Amendment may be used for grants to Mr. Schanzer, our CEO. 
While the Board has considered alternatives to the issuance of equity awards as a means to compensate our key employees, including the adoption of additional cash incentive programs, we believe equity awards are a critical component of our pay mix that is designed to balance short-term cash incentives with long-term incentives to promote value creation for our shareholders.

    2019 Proxy Statement  |  7 
PROXY STATEMENT 
Please also note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a bank, broker or other nominee), you will need to bring a copy of the brokerage statement reflecting your share ownership as of March 8, 2019. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
On the record date of March 8, 2019, the Company had 89,050,262 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote with respect to all matters to be acted upon at the meeting. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such holder. The presence of holders representing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. In accordance with Maryland law, abstentions, but not broker non-votes, are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. 
How do I vote? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and the proxy notice was sent directly to you by us. In that case, you may instruct the proxy holders named in the enclosed proxy card (the "Proxy Agents") how to vote your common shares in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote Online: You can vote via Internet by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card or voting  instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Telephone: You can vote by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card or voting  instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Regular Mail: You can vote by mail by signing and dating the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form  and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided with this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
Proxies submitted over the internet, by telephone or by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. 
If you vote by telephone, via the Internet, or by signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card, your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting as you direct. If you sign the enclosed proxy card but do not specify how you want your shares to be voted, they will be voted as the Board recommends. 
Can I revoke my proxy? 
Each proxy executed and returned by a stockholder may be revoked at any time before it is voted by timely submission of written notice of revocation or by submission of a duly executed proxy bearing a later date (in either case addressed to the Secretary of the Company at our corporate offices) or, if a stockholder is present at the meeting, he or she may elect to revoke his/her proxy and vote his/her shares personally. Votes for shares held by a bank, broker or other holder of record, may be revoked by a stockholder submitting new voting instructions to the bank, broker or other holder of record or, if a stockholder has obtained a legal proxy from the bank, broker or other holder of record giving him or her the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting, by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
8  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
PROXY STATEMENT 
What vote is required to approve each matter? 
Assuming the presence of a quorum, each of Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in order to pass. The proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers is advisory only and is not binding on the Company or the Board. We treat abstentions as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum but abstentions will not be counted as "votes cast." Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4 or any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, assuming a quorum is present. 
If the proxy is submitted and voting instructions are made for some, but not all, of the proposals, as to matters in which instructions are given, the proxy will be voted in accordance with those instructions, and for all other proposals, the proxy will be voted "FOR" as to all enumerated proposals in accordance with the Board's recommendations. 
What if I hold my shares in street name? 
Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote with respect to any of the proposals, except with respect to the ratification of Ernst & Young as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") , the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is considered a routine item. Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may exercise its discretion to vote your shares on this proposal. If your broker exercises this discretion, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at our Annual Meeting and will be voted in the manner directed by your broker on the proposal to ratify Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm, but your shares will constitute broker non-votes on each of the other proposals at our Annual Meeting. On all other proposals, your broker is not permitted to vote your shares without your instructions and uninstructed shares are considered broker non-votes. Accordingly, a broker non-vote will not be counted in determining the outcome of the vote on these matters. If your shares are held by a broker, the broker will ask you how you want to vote your shares. 
If you provide the broker with instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give any instruction on any of the proposals, then with respect to the election of directors and the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, your shares will not be voted. Therefore, it is important that you give instructions to your broker as to how to vote your shares. 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit the enclosed proxy to vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later are unable to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If I plan to attend the Annual Meeting, should I still vote by proxy? 
Yes. Voting in advance does not affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting. If you submit the enclosed proxy card and also attend the Annual Meeting, you do not need to vote again at the Annual Meeting unless you want to change your vote. Written ballots will be available at the Annual Meeting for stockholders of record. If you are not a stockholder of record but hold the shares through a broker or nominee (i.e., in street name), you may vote your shares in person only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, trustee or nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions prior to the meeting as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.

PROXY STATEMENT 
Who is soliciting the proxies and who pays the costs? 
The enclosed proxy for the Annual Meeting is being solicited by the Board. Proxies also may be solicited, without annual compensation, by our trustees and officers by mail, telephone or other electronic means or in person. We are paying the costs of this solicitation, including the preparation, printing, mailing and website hosting of proxy materials. It is anticipated that banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries will forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common shares to obtain their voting instructions and that we will reimburse such persons for their out-of-pocket expenses.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
Commitment to Stockholder Engagement 
We appreciate and value the engagement of our stockholders and actively solicit stockholder feedback. Throughout the year, management communicated in meetings, property visits, telephone calls and/or written communications with several significant stockholders to better understand their perspectives on corporate governance, overall compensation, strategy, and business operations. 
During 2018, as part of our stockholder engagement, we contacted stockholders accounting for over 65% of our outstanding shares, and received acceptances from, and actively engaged with, stockholders representing over 40% of our outstanding common shares. During much of such outreach, we made available to our stockholders our CEO and several independent directors, representing all of our Board committees, including the Chairs of our Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees. Several shareholders declined our invitation to meet, indicating that they were satisfied with our current compensation and corporate governance practices and that they did not deem a meeting necessary at the time. Including our directors' and executives' outreach to shareholders, the Company conducted over 100 telephonic or in-person meetings with key stockholders during 2018 alone. We also took key stockholders who expressed interest on guided tours of our properties. 
In addition, we have routine telephonic meetings with proxy advisors, such as ISS, to stay informed as to their views on best practices in governance and compensation trends, and to elicit meaningful feedback on initiatives the Company is considering. 
We accord great weight and importance to our stockholders' concerns. Feedback received from our stockholders during our outreach process was shared with the Board and its committees and taken into account when considering and, in many cases adopting, proposed changes to corporate governance and compensation practices. 
Below is a summary of what we learned from our stockholders over the past several years and the actions we took in direct response to our stockholder engagement and study of best practices:

We believe that these significant compensation changes and governance enhancements demonstrate our commitment to stockholder engagement and responsiveness to stockholder feedback. We will continue to actively engage with our investors on these and other topics and to provide transparent disclosure as to the evolution in our thinking and practices as a result of this important feedback. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles that address significant issues of corporate governance and set forth procedures by which the Board carries out its responsibilities. Among the areas addressed by the Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles are director responsibilities, management responsibilities, director access to management, employees and advisors, management succession, annual performance evaluation of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, director compensation and meeting procedures. The Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles are available on the Company's website at www.cedarrealtytrust.com. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
All of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Chief Investment Officer, and our directors are required to comply with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code is available on our website at www.cedarrealtytrust.com. We intend to disclose any amendments we make to, or waivers of, certain provisions of our Code of Business Ethics applicable to our officers and directors on our website within three (3) business days following such waiver or as otherwise required by the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") or the NYSE. 
Board of Directors 
Independent Directors 
Pursuant to rules of the NYSE and applicable law, a majority of our directors must be "independent." Each year, the Board reviews the independence of the Company's directors, including a review of any transactions and relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family, on the one hand, and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other. The Board also examines transactions and relationships between directors or their affiliates and members of the Company's senior management or their affiliates. The purpose of this review is to determine whether any such relationship or transaction was inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  19 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
As a result of this year's review, the Board affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Eisenstat, Gonsalves, Rogers and Widmann, and Mses. Hootkin and Kanner is independent of the Company and its management. The Board determined that none of these independent directors had any material relationships with the Company. Mr. Schanzer, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, is the only director who is not independent by virtue of his employment with the Company. In addition, none of our directors' family members are employed by the Company in any capacity. Therefore, following the election of our seven director-nominees at the Annual Meeting, we believe that 85.7% of our Board members will be independent under the NYSE rules. 
Leadership Structure of the Board 
The Board has a non-executive Chairman to ensure independent oversight of management. Roger M. Widmann, an independent director of the Company since 2003, has been chosen by the directors to be the non-executive Chairman of the Board and to preside at meetings of the Board. Mr. Widmann and the other non-management directors of our Board are actively involved in corporate governance matters and meet in executive session several times during the year, generally on the same day as regularly scheduled meetings of the Board or its committees (or as otherwise considered necessary or appropriate). 
A key responsibility of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is to ensure continuity of leadership of the Company. Each year, the Chief Executive Officer presents a succession plan to the Board for its review and consideration. 
Board Composition 
At Cedar, we believe that healthy counterpoint catalyzes good decision making. We cultivate cognitive diversity not only at our Board and management levels, but throughout our organizational ranks, because we believe, among other benefits, that such diversity of viewpoint fosters productive exchange of ideas that ultimately drives long-term value. 
Our director nominees represent a broad panoply of perspectives, including with respect to gender, age, race, tenure, skills, and experience, as illustrated below:(1)

[END TABLE]
All of these documents can be found by accessing the "Investors" tab on our website at www.cedarrealtytrust.com and clicking on "Corporate Governance." The documents noted above will also be provided without charge to any stockholder who requests them. We periodically review our corporate governance policies, monitor emerging developments in corporate governance, and enhance our policies and procedures when our Board determines that it would benefit our Company and our stockholders to do so. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
Our share ownership guidelines require that our CEO and other named executive officers own shares or limited partnership units with an aggregate value of 4x and 2x base salary, respectively, in each case with a four-year phase-in period. For each non-employee director who has served as a director for four years or more, such director is expected to own shares of our common stock, including restricted stock, totaling not less than the number of shares constituting the equity portion of his or her annual retainer in the aggregate over the previous four years. We believe these stockholding requirements reaffirm the Company's alignment between its strategic decision-makers and its stockholders. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
We do not consider it appropriate for any of the Company's officers, directors or employees to enter into speculative transactions in the Company's securities that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in market value of the Company's securities. As a result, we have adopted a policy that prohibits officers, directors or employees from purchasing puts, calls, options or other derivative securities based on the Company's securities. The policy also prohibits hedging or monetization 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  21 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
transactions, such as forward sale contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Officers, directors and employees also are not permitted to purchase securities of the Company on margin, borrow against any account in which the Company's securities are held or otherwise pledge any securities of the Company. 
Risk Management 
Management has primary responsibility for identifying, monitoring, mitigating, and managing our exposure to risk, subject to active oversight by our Board. The Board, directly and through its committees, discusses with management any significant enterprise risks and reviews the guidelines, policies and procedures we have in place to address those risks, such as our approval process for significant acquisitions, dispositions and other investments. The Board receives quarterly risk assessment presentations that are both quantitative and qualitative in nature. This process enables our Board to focus on the strategic, financial, operational, legal, regulatory and other risks that are most significant to us and our business in terms of risk likelihood and potential impact and ensures that our enterprise risks are well understood, mitigated to the extent reasonable and consistent with the Board's view of our risk profile and risk tolerance. 
Each of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees exercises its own oversight related to the risks associated with the particular responsibilities of that committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Audit Committee reviews financial, accounting and internal control risks and the mechanisms through which we assess and  manage risk, in accordance with NYSE requirements, and has certain responsibilities with respect to our compliance programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Compensation Committee evaluates whether our compensation policies and practices, as they relate to both executive  officers and employees generally, encourage excessive risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee focuses on risks related to corporate governance, Board effectiveness and  succession planning.  
[END TABLE]
No Director Overboarding 
In order to stay aligned with best practices and to ensure the appropriate level of commitment, we endeavor to ensure that our Board members are not overboarded. For six of our seven directors, ours is the only public company board on which they serve. Our non-executive chairman, Mr. Widmann, serves on one other public company board in addition to our Company. 
Audit Committee 
The Board has established an Audit Committee consisting of Steven G. Rogers (Chair), Abraham Eisenstat, Gregg A. Gonsalves and Pamela N. Hootkin, all of whom are independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and applicable law. All members of our Audit Committee are qualified as audit committee financial experts within the meaning of applicable law and the Board has determined that each of them has accounting and related financial management expertise under the rules of the NYSE. The designation of "audit committee financial expert" does not impose upon such persons any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than are generally imposed on such persons as members of the Audit Committee and the Board, and such designation does not affect the duties, obligations or liabilities of any other member of the Board. 
The principal functions of the Audit Committee are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employ the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, subject to stockholder ratification, to audit the  Company's consolidated financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approve or pre-approve all services performed by the Company's independent  registered public accounting firm, including fees and terms;

Compensation Committee 
The Board has established a Compensation Committee consisting of Pamela N. Hootkin (Chair), Gregg A. Gonsalves, Sabrina L. Kanner and Roger M. Widmann, all of whom are independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and applicable law. The principal functions of the Compensation Committee are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and approve the compensation and benefits of executive officers, as well as administer and make recommendations to  the Board regarding director compensation;

• develop and recommend to the Board cash incentive and equity-based compensation programs and plans;

• review the relationship between the Company's compensation practices and effective risk management.   
[END TABLE]
The charter of the Compensation Committee is available on the Company's website at www.cedarrealtytrust.com. 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent compensation consultants or other advisors to assist it in formulating the Company's total compensation plan. In designing the 2018 executive compensation plan setting executive compensation for 2018, our Compensation Committee retained Mercer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MMC, as its compensation consultant. The consultant provided to the Compensation Committee relevant survey and market compensation data and compared the Company's compensation to the survey data. The Compensation Committee has relied on the guidance of the consultant in formulating and refining the Company's executive compensation practices. In selecting Mercer, the Compensation Committee evaluated Mercer's independence and considered the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mercer does not provide any other services to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of fees to be received by Mercer from the Company as a percentage of total revenues of MMC;   
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The lack of any business or personal relationships between Mercer and any executive officer of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  23 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
After considering the foregoing, the Compensation Committee determined that Mercer was independent of the Company and management of the Company and that the engagement of Mercer did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
In the formulation and negotiation of the terms of the new CEO and CFO employment agreements, effective as of June 2018, the Compensation Committee was advised by Mercer, in addition to FPL Associates, L.P. ("FPL"). For more information about the work performed by FPL, please see below under "Nomination of Directors." 
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee 
The Board has established a Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee consisting of Abraham Eisenstat (Chair), Sabrina L. Kanner, Steven G. Rogers, and Roger M. Widmann, all of whom are independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and applicable law. The principal functions of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• develop and recommend to the Board a set of corporate governance principles;  
[END TABLE]

The charter of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is available on the Company's website at www.cedarrealtytrust.com. 
Board and Committee Performance Self-Evaluation 
To optimize the performance of the Board and its committees each year, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversees a robust self-assessment of the Board and each of its committees that elicits candid feedback on the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its committees, as well as on the efficacy of the self-evaluation process itself. As part of this self-assessment, directors are asked to consider the Board's composition and structure, key responsibilities, and meetings, among other criteria. Each committee separately conducts its own assessment, and in assessing its structure and performance, considers its role and the responsibilities articulated in the committee charter, the composition of the committee and the conduct of committee meetings. We believe that a thorough Board and committee evaluation process that is focused on the assessment and alignment of director skills with company strategy is more effective than solely relying on strict tenure limits. Throughout the year, the Board and each of its committees routinely use a portion of their regularly scheduled executive sessions to reflect upon and discuss how their oversight performance on behalf of stockholders might be improved. 
Nomination of Directors 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the selection and nomination of directors and considers candidates for Board membership suggested by its members, other Board members, management, stockholders and nationally recognized search firms. Stockholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send nominations directly to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, at the principal executive offices of the Company, that include all information relating to 
24  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, including the nominee's name, business experience and consent to be nominated for membership on our Board and to serve if elected by the stockholders. We did not receive any recommended nominees for director from any of our stockholders, other than from our directors, in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
In February 2018, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee engaged Ferguson Partners, L.P. ("Ferguson") to assist in identifying and evaluating potential candidates to fill a Board vacancy created by the retirement of a long-serving director. That search resulted in the appointment of Sabrina L. Kanner to our Board on June 8, 2018, and her concomitant appointment to each of the Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees. Ferguson received $65,000 and $6,777 in 2018, in fees and expenses, respectively, for work performed in connection with our director search. 
Additionally, in 2017, the Company engaged FPL, an affiliate of Ferguson, to provide advisory services relating to the design of executive employment agreements and the Company's long-term equity incentive compensation program. FPL received $14,000 in fees during 2018 for services related to providing advice on executive and long-term incentive compensation in connection with the renewal of our named executive officer employment agreements. The services provided by Ferguson and FPL have been reviewed in their entirety by the Company and were determined not to raise any conflicts of interest. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has a carefully designed protocol for identifying and selecting nominees for Board positions, which were followed in the search leading up to Ms. Kanner's appointment as well as the appointments of other directors in recent years. 
Once the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has identified a prospective nominee, it makes an initial determination as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate. This initial determination is based on information provided to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's own knowledge of the prospective candidate, which may be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. The preliminary determination is based primarily on the need for additional Board members to fill vacancies, provide for succession or expand the size of the Board and the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the evaluation factors described below. If the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee determines, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and other Board members as appropriate, that additional consideration is warranted, it may request additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and report its findings to the Board. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee then evaluates the prospective nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in the Company's guidelines, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of the prospective nominee to represent the interests of the stockholders of the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the prospective nominee's standards of integrity, commitment and independence of thought and judgment;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the prospective nominee's ability to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to the diligent performance of his  or her duties, including the prospective nominee's service on other public company boards and other professional experience to enhance the Board's effectiveness;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the extent to which the prospective nominee contributes to the range of talent, skill and expertise appropriate for the  business of the Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the extent to which the prospective nominee provides the Board with diversity in experience and background.   
[END TABLE]
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board, the balance of management and independent directors, the need for Audit Committee expertise and the evaluations of other prospective

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW 
nominees. In connection with this evaluation, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee determines whether the person should be considered for a Board position, and one or more members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, and others as appropriate, interview prospective nominees in person or by telephone. The candidate is then required to complete a series of compliance and vetting questionnaires, submit to a background check, establish qualification for service and fitness to serve, as well as identify potential conflicts of interest. Upon satisfactory completion of the interview, vetting process and evaluation, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board as to the person(s) who should be nominated by the Board, and the Board determines the nominee(s) after considering the recommendation and report of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. 
There are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by management, a stockholder, another Board member or an outside search firm. 
New Director Orientation 
The Board has a program for orienting new directors that is overseen by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. New directors receive materials with an overview of their duties and responsibilities, significant corporate governance documents of the Company, incorporation documents, regulatory filings, investor presentations, Company policies and committee calendars. They are also required to complete a series of annual compliance questionnaires, and financial disclosures. In addition, directors attend tours of our properties, as opportunities present, to familiarize themselves with the Company's portfolio of assets. 
Board Meetings 
In the year ended December 31, 2018, there were 12 meetings (combination of in-person and telephonic) of the Board, four in-person meetings of the Audit Committee, 14 meetings (combination of in-person and telephonic) of the Compensation Committee and four in-person meetings of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. Each incumbent director of the Company standing for reelection attended in excess of 80% of the total number of meetings held of the Board and committees on which he or she served during his or her tenure of service in 2018. Board members are encouraged to, and do, attend our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of our current directors, excluding Ms. Kanner who was elected to the Board on June 8, 2018, were present at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2018. 
Communications with the Board 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Board has approved a process for handling letters received by the Company and addressed to non-management members of the Board. Stockholders and other parties interested in communicating with any of the directors of the Company (or the Board as a group), may do so by writing to the Secretary of the Company, at 44 South Bayles Avenue, Port Washington, NY 11050. The Secretary will review all such correspondence and regularly forward to the Board a summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the Secretary's opinion, deals with the functions of the Board or committees thereof or that she otherwise determines requires the Board's attention. The Board or any member thereof may at any time request that copies of all such correspondence be forwarded to the Board. 
Correspondence relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters that could materially impact the Company's financial statements is handled by the Audit Committee in accordance with its procedures.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary 
This section of our Proxy Statement discusses the principles underlying our executive compensation policies and decisions for our named executive officers. For 2018, the Company's named executive officers were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Bruce J. Schanzer, President and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Philip R. Mays, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Robin M. Zeigler, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

No other employees of the Company qualified as executive officers under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. 
In June 2011, the Company hired Mr. Bruce J. Schanzer as CEO and Mr. Philip R. Mays as CFO as part of a long-term strategic plan for improving Company performance. At the time they were hired, the Company and the Compensation Committee affirmed that a core objective of the executive compensation program was to align management's compensation with long-term stockholder value creation. 
Performance Highlights 
In executing our long-term strategic plan, we have achieved several important improvements to our portfolio, balance sheet and earnings, as illustrated below:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Beginning with the hiring of Messrs. Schanzer and Mays, the Company and the Compensation Committee, under the guidance of the Company's independent compensation consultant, refined our compensation structure. This structure was designed to retain, compensate and incentivize Company executives, commensurate with their experience, responsibilities and accomplishments, and align executive pay with the Company's long-term strategic objectives and achievement of enhanced stockholder value. Our executive compensation program includes three primary elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  i.  base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ii.  annual cash incentive bonus; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  iii.  long-term equity incentive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
A significant portion of executive compensation is at risk and variable depending on both our short-term financial performance and long-term creation of stockholder value, with the largest portion of at-risk compensation designed to incentivize our executives to focus on long-term stockholder value creation. 
For 2018, our named executive officers' base salaries remained unchanged from 2017. Mr. Schanzer's new employment agreement provides for, among other things, a $50,000 reduction in base salary commencing in 2019 to $750,000 per annum. Mr. Mays' new employment agreement provides for an unchanged base pay of $400,000 per annum for 2019. Ms. Zeigler's base pay for 2019 also remained unchanged at $400,000 per annum. 
As explained more fully below on page 37 in the section entitled, "Annual Cash Incentive Bonus," in setting performance criteria for 2018 bonuses for our named executive officers, our Compensation Committee determined that 70% of the bonus would be based on the Company's achievement of its targeted Operating FFO, and 30% would be based on a qualitative individual performance evaluation for each of those executives. For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to award our CEO, CFO and COO annual bonuses of $720,000, $342,000 and $342,000, respectively, which corresponded to 90% of their respective target amounts. The Company's performance-based component was based on 2018 Operating FFO that corresponded to payout at the full target amount, but the Compensation Committee and Board exercised their discretion to exclude certain non-recurring income, resulting in an adjusted Operating FFO below target but above the threshold amount. Were those non-recurring income items not excluded, the payout to our executives would have been higher. The individual performance-based component was valued according to an assessment of attainment of goals applicable to each named executive officer's function. 
Long-term equity incentive compensation vests based on continued service to the Company and, for the CEO, the Company's TSR. We believe that awarding senior executives a significant amount of their compensation in the form of equity incentive awards aligns management's incentives with long-term stockholder value creation and encourages retention. 
To effectively ensure the alignment of executive compensation with long-term performance, we have at times (including this year for our CEO) awarded multi-year equity awards to top executives, generally in the form of restricted stock grants, with a five-year vesting period, which is longer than our typical three-year vesting period, in lieu of annual grants over a subsequent multi-year period. Stock grants that contain long-term vesting provisions give senior executives an incentive to remain with the Company. Also, long vesting periods, coupled with performance conditions for our executives that are based, in part, on achievement of an average TSR goal over the preceding three-year period, create a significant positive incentive to make decisions that engender strong results over a sustained period of time. We believe this structure appropriately focuses our executive officers on the creation of long-term value and encourages prudent evaluation of risks. Performance-based equity ensures alignment of executive incentives with stockholder returns. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  31 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As evidence of this pay/performance alignment, as a result of TSR-based performance targets not having been met at the end of the performance period as defined in Mr Schanzer's prior employment agreement, in June 2018, under the terms of that agreement, Mr. Schanzer forfeited 1,250,000 shares of restricted stock, with a value of approximately $5.5 million as of the date of forfeiture. 
Pay and Governance Practices 
Our executive compensation program includes a number of features intended to reflect best practices in the market and to help ensure that the program reinforces our stockholders' interests, including:

Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain talented senior executives, ensure that their compensation remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly-situated senior executives at comparable publicly-traded REITs, and reward them for superior performance. The program is further designed to reward both short- and long-term performance and to align our senior executives' and stockholders' interests. To that end, we believe the compensation packages we provide to our named executive officers should include both cash and share-based incentive compensation that reward performance as measured, in large part, against corporate and individual goals that will enhance stockholder value over the long term. 
We believe the overall compensation of our senior executives should primarily reflect their accomplishments as a management team in achieving established key objectives, including the execution of the strategic plan. We also believe the achievement of these key objectives will ultimately enhance stockholder value as reflected in an increased share price. We believe the compensation of our senior executives should not be based on short-term performance of our shares, whether favorable 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  33 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
or unfavorable, but rather that the long-term price of our shares is a better reflection of the management of our Company by our senior executives. In this regard, the restricted stock historically granted to our senior executives has vesting periods ranging from three to seven years. Our senior executives are aligned with our shareholders in that they are also subject to the downside risk of a decrease in the value of their compensation in the event the price of our shares declines. 
Consistent with this philosophy, our executive pay program uses a combination of base salary, annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards, with a significant portion of compensation being at risk and dependent on the performance of the Company and the executive, to align executive interests with those of stockholders. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing, implementing, and continually monitoring adherence to our compensation philosophy as applied to our named executive officers. For more information related to the processes and procedures of the Compensation Committee in determining the compensation of our named executive officers, see "Corporate Governance  Overview–Compensation Committee" above. 
Annual Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation and Engagement with Stockholders 
Our compensation philosophy is informed by input from our stockholders. We hold an annual stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation. At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting, stockholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers for 2017 with approximately 98% of the votes cast voting to approve such compensation. While this vote is considered a non-binding advisory vote, our Compensation Committee and Board value the opinions of our stockholders and seriously consider the voting results when making future executive compensation decisions and in designing the executive compensation program. When making executive compensation decisions for 2019, the Compensation Committee considered the favorable results of the 2018 advisory vote. The chart below sets forth the results of our annual stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation for each of the last four years.

 Our Compensation Committee believes the Company's track record of increasingly favorable say on pay approval percentages in  recent years is indicative of general stockholder support for the structure of our executive compensation program.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews all elements of compensation to ensure that we remain competitive in the market and to ensure that overall compensation, including the mix of stock and cash, is aligned with our business objectives, our performance and the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee values constructive feedback from our stockholders about executive compensation as discussed below and promotes serious consideration of their viewpoints. 
We are committed to meaningful stockholder engagement because it allows us to understand and consider the viewpoints of our stockholders. During 2018, as part of our stockholder engagement, we contacted stockholders accounting for over 65% of our outstanding shares, and received acceptances from, and actively engaged with, stockholders representing over 40% of our outstanding common shares. During much of such outreach, we made available our CEO and several independent directors, representing all of our Board committees, including the Chairs of our Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees. Several shareholders declined our invitation to meet, indicating that they were satisfied with our current compensation and corporate governance practices and that they did not deem a meeting necessary at the time. We also arranged for guided property tours for key stockholders who expressed interest. 
For a summary of changes we made to our executive compensation practices in response to feedback from our stockholders, see "Corporate Governance Overview—Commitment to Stockholder Engagement" above.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Objectives 
The Compensation Committee uses three primary pay elements in its executive compensation program: base salary, annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term equity compensation. 
Base salary is intended to attract and retain talented executives and to provide compensation that is commensurate with the executive's scope of responsibility and effectiveness. Cash incentive bonuses are designed to align the executive's compensation with our short-term business goals and individual performance goals. Long-term equity compensation focuses on achieving our long-term TSR goals and executive retention. We use long-term equity to retain our executives by rewarding them with equity only if they remain with us for a substantial period of time and if the Company achieves specified average TSR goals over the preceding three-year period. The allocation between cash and non-cash compensation or short- and long-term compensation is established on an annual basis. A significant portion of compensation is at risk and variable depending on both short- and long-term financial performance, with the largest portion designed to incentivize executives to focus on long-term stockholder value creation. 
Market Comparison 
For 2018, Mercer used comparable data sets from a NAREIT survey to assess compensation levels for named executive officers. This approach is consistent with the one taken since 2015, when due to changes in both the size and comparability of the Company's historical peers, the Compensation Committee determined to rely primarily on NAREIT survey data rather than peer group information in setting executive pay. 
The NAREIT survey data for 2018 represented a total of 143 REITs and uses a broad market reference of REITs with total capitalization under $1.5 billion, from $1.5 billion to $3 billion, as well as retail REITs of all sizes, many of which compete with the Company for executive talent. (As of March 8, 2019, the Company's total capitalization was approximately $1.1 billion.) Mercer furnished the Compensation Committee with a report that compared the Company's executive officer compensation to the relevant survey data. This report was considered by the Compensation Committee in setting total compensation for 2018. 
In addition, in connection with the design and negotiation of the amended and restated CEO employment agreement, Mercer also provided the Compensation Committee with proxy data for a relevant subset of publicly traded REITs regarding CEO pay levels, pay practices, and contract terms. 
Although comparisons of compensation paid to our senior management relative to compensation paid to similarly situated executives in the survey assists the Compensation Committee in determining compensation, the Compensation Committee does not benchmark pay to a specific targeted position and principally evaluates compensation based on the corporate business and strategic objectives and considerations discussed above. 
Implementation 
The Compensation Committee determines the appropriate level and mix of compensation. The Compensation Committee also considers the individual components of compensation, as well as the total compensation received by each named executive officer, relative to each officer's performance, the market and the Company's other named executive officers in making its determination. The amount each executive actually earns varies based on the Company's performance and the executive's performance, contribution and overall value to the Company. The Compensation Committee also conducts an annual review of our CEO's performance and considers these results when determining the CEO's compensation. Our CEO plays a significant role in setting the compensation for our other 
36  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
members of senior management, including named executive officers, by providing the Compensation Committee with an evaluation of their performance, together with recommendations for the amount of the annual cash incentive bonus and the size of long-term equity awards. The Compensation Committee also obtains input from Mercer and has discretion to accept, reject or modify the CEO's recommendations. 
Base Salary 
Base salaries for our named executive officers depend on the scope of their responsibilities and performance. Base salary is designed to compensate the executives fairly for services rendered during the year. These salaries are compared to NAREIT executive compensation survey data. The Compensation Committee receives from Mr. Schanzer his recommended salary level for each executive officer (other than Mr. Schanzer) for their review. For 2018, all of the named executive officers' base salaries remained unchanged from 2017. 
The Compensation Committee is required to review base salaries annually and may increase, but not decrease, the salaries of Messrs. Schanzer and Mays and Ms. Zeigler pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements. In making decisions regarding executive officers' base salaries, the Compensation Committee takes into account relevant factors, including individual performance and market compensation data. 
In connection with his 2018 contract renewal, and taking into account market conditions impacting Company performance, the Company reduced the CEO's base pay by $50,000 from $800,000 to $750,000 per annum beginning in 2019. 
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus 
The Compensation Committee seeks to align the interests of the named executive officers with the interests of stockholders by linking executive pay to individual performance and specified financial objectives. 
In setting objectives at the beginning of the year, the Compensation Committee determined that 70% of the bonus of named executive officers would be based on the Company's attainment of its targeted operating FFO (after taking into account payment of bonuses), and 30% would be based on a qualitative evaluation of the individual performance of each of the executives. Operating FFO is a key annual earnings measurement for the Company, as is the case for other REITs. The Company considers Operating FFO to be a meaningful measure of financial performance because it excludes items the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance, such as acquisition pursuit costs, amounts relating to early extinguishment of debt and preferred stock redemption costs, management transition costs and certain redevelopment costs. The Company believes Operating FFO also provides a consistent basis for comparing the Company's performance across reporting periods. The Operating FFO bonus targets and actual Operating FFO for 2018 were as follows:

The annual cash incentive bonuses awarded to the CEO, CFO and COO for 2018 are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Long-Term Compensation 
We believe that outstanding long-term performance is achieved when executives have an ownership position that encourages them to focus on the Company's long-term success. Long-term equity awards are made to eligible employees to align their long-term interests with those of stockholders, deliver market competitive pay, provide a strong retentive hook, and aid in recruitment. At the same time, by incentivizing our senior management as stakeholders in our performance, the Company benefits on an operational level from improved productivity and efficiency gains, and the associated value creation. Recipients of awards under this program realize value typically over a three-year, and occasionally a five-year, vesting period. We believe that the combination of this extended vesting period with the requirement that our named executive officers continually hold a significant equity position in the Company creates a strong long-term alignment of interests between decision makers at the Company and our stockholders.
Stock awards vest based on either performance, continued service or both, subject to acceleration of vesting in certain circumstances, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and as further provided in the employment agreements and/or award agreements with the named executive officers. 
With the exception of the CEO's equity grants which are denominated in shares, our practice is for the Compensation Committee to approve grants of long-term equity compensation as dollar-denominated awards and then to grant a number of shares that have a fair market value equal to the aggregate dollar value of the award based on the closing price of a share of common stock on the day the grant is made. 
The Compensation Committee continues to believe that TSR is the most proximate measure to align CEO pay with stockholder value creation. TSR was selected as the basis for the CEO's performance-based long-term equity award as it ties this portion of the compensation to stockholder value, with the total value of this award corresponding to stock price appreciation and dividends. The Compensation Committee believed that absolute TSR was the appropriate measure for Company performance as: (a) it more directly aligns the interests of our CEO with our stockholders, and (b) there are few other REITs with the Company's business strategy, making construction of a suitable performance peer group difficult.

Mr. Schanzer. When Mr. Schanzer was hired in 2011, he received restricted stock grants totaling 2,500,000 common shares, one-half of which were time-based, vesting upon the seventh anniversary of the date of grant (June 15, 2018), provided that Mr. Schanzer remained continuously employed by the Company through such date, and the other half of which were market performance-based, to be earned only if the total annual return on an investment in the Company's common stock (TSR) was at least an average of 6.5% per year for the seven years ended June 15, 2018. On June 15, 2018, the 1,250,000 time-based shares vested and the 1,250,000 market performance-based shares were forfeited as the market performance criteria were not achieved. 
On June 15, 2018, in connection with his entry into an amended and restated employment agreement, Mr. Schanzer received a grant of 750,000 shares of restricted stock that will vest in full upon the fifth anniversary of the effective date of his employment agreement (June 15, 2023), subject to Mr. Schanzer's continued employment with the Company through such date. Mr. Schanzer was also granted 250,000 shares of time-based restricted common stock in January 2019 in connection with the renewal of his employment contract that will fully vest upon the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the employment agreement, subject to Mr. Schanzer's continued employment with the Company through such date. Consistent with time-based restricted grant awards to other participants, dividends will be paid currently on these restricted shares. 
Mr. Schanzer was also granted a market performance-based equity award of 1,500,000 restricted stock units ("RSUs") and 1,500,000 dividend equivalent rights of the Company. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one common share if certain market performance criteria are achieved. During the three years ending June 15, 2021 (the "Interim Performance Period," as defined in the agreement), a maximum of 750,000 shares, or half of the performance-based equity award, can be earned. Any portion of the market performance-based equity award that is not earned as of the end of the Interim Performance Period will be carried forward for calculation over the five years ending June 15, 2023 (the "Full Performance Period"). The percentage of the market performance-based equity award to be earned will be determined based on the Company's average annual TSR over the Interim Performance Period and/or over the Full Performance Period as follows: if average annual TSR (1) is below 4%, the percentage of grant earned would be 0%, (2) equals 4%, the percentage of grant earned would be 33.3%, (3) equals 6.5%, the percentage of grant earned would be 66.7%, and (4) equals 10% or above, the percentage of grant earned would be 100%. Linear interpolation shall be applied to determine the percentage of the market performance-based equity award that is earned where the average annual TSR over the performance period falls between the percentages set forth above. An independent appraisal determined the value of the market performance-based equity award for the interim and full performance periods to be $3.30 and $2.97 per share, respectively, compared to a market price at the date of grant of $4.38 per share. 
TSR was selected as the basis for the CEO's performance-based long-term equity award because it ties this portion of the CEO's compensation directly to stockholder value, with the total value of this award corresponding to stock price appreciation and dividends. Consistent with the philosophy underlying Company performance-based LTIP awards, the Compensation Committee believed that absolute TSR was the appropriate measure of the Company's long-term performance with respect to CEO compensation because: (a) it more directly aligns the interests of our CEO with our stockholders, and (b) there are few other REITs with the Company's business strategy, making construction of a suitable performance peer group difficult. 
The dividend equivalent rights ("DERs") awarded in connection with the performance-based RSUs will accrue and will be deemed to be reinvested into the Company's common stock and payment with respect to the DERs will be deferred until the end of the Interim Performance Period, or the Full Performance Period, as the case may be, to coincide with the vesting, if any, of the market performance-based equity award. Only those RSUs that are earned based on our Average Annual 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  41 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
TSR achievement will vest and be settled in shares, and DERs are only earned if, and to the extent that, the market performance-based equity awards vest. If Mr. Schanzer fails to achieve the applicable performance targets at the end of the Full Performance Period, any unearned RSUs will be forfeited and he will likewise forfeit the commensurate number of DERs. 
If the RSUs vest and if the Company's Average Annual TSR return for the period between June 15, 2018 and the June 15, 2023 (or, if the RSUs vest earlier pursuant to the terms of the Mr. Schanzer's employment agreement, the date on which the RSUs vest) is greater than 10%, Mr. Schanzer shall be entitled to a cash amount equal to (i) (A) 500,000 multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Company's average annual total shareholder return minus 10% (expressed as a number rather than a percentage) and the denominator of which is ten, (provided that, in no event shall such fraction be greater than one) multiplied, by (ii) (x) if such vesting occurs in connection with a Change in Control, the per share sale price in the Change in Control and (y) in all other circumstances, the average closing price of our common stock for the 20 trading days prior to such vesting date. No additional cash payment will be made for average annual total shareholder return above 20%. 
Mr. Schanzer will not be eligible for any additional equity awards under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan for a period of five years following the effective date of his employment agreement. 
Mr. Mays. We did not grant any equity awards to Mr. Mays in 2018. In connection with his entry into his amended and restated employment agreement, Mr. Mays was granted an award of time-based restricted stock that is described below on page 50 in the section entitled "Employment Agreements With Named Executive Officers — New CFO Employment Agreement." 
Ms. Zeigler. On February 7, 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Zeigler a grant of 386,266 shares of restricted stock that will vest in full on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, provided she continues to be employed by the Company through such date. This grant is in lieu of any additional grants of Company stock for the three-year period commencing on the date of grant. 
Employment Agreements 
During 2018, the Company had employment agreements with each of its named executive officers: Messrs. Schanzer and Mays, and Ms. Zeigler. Effective June 2018, upon the natural expiration of the employment agreements of Messrs. Schanzer and Mays, the Company entered into new employment agreements with each, taking into account current thinking as to best compensation practices and constructive input from our stockholders. These agreements are described in detail on page 48 in the section entitled "Employment Agreements With Named Executive Officers." 
Perquisites 
The only material perquisites provided to our named executive officers relate to automobile payments and reimbursement for certain expenses incurred. Our named executive officers are not entitled to U.S. Federal income tax gross-ups on any perquisites that are provided. 
Retirement Benefits 
Named executive officers are given the opportunity to participate in the Company's tax-qualified 401(k) plans providing for employer and employee contributions. In 2018, the Company matched 100% of the first 3% of eligible employee compensation contributed and 50% of the next 2% of eligible employee compensation contributed up to the annual limit of 4% of eligible compensation, which amounts to $11,000 per recipient for 2018. The Company does not provide supplemental retirement benefits. Messrs. Schanzer and Mays and Ms. Zeigler each received the maximum match.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Several members of our senior management team, including Messrs. Schanzer and Mays and Ms. Zeigler, participate in the Company's 2005 Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan ("Rabbi Trust Plan"). Under this deferred compensation plan, participants may defer a portion of their base salaries and cash bonuses on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on such amounts based on the performance of specific investments selected by the participants. Participants may also defer share awards made under the Company's 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, as well as related dividends. In connection with this plan, the Company has established a "rabbi trust" overseen by an independent trustee (the "Rabbi Trust") wherein the trustee is directed to make investments of the deferred cash amounts which track as closely as possible to those selected by each participant in order to generally match its liabilities to the participants under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit market risk. 
Clawback Policy 
The SEC has not yet issued final regulations regarding clawback policies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). We intend to adopt a clawback policy in conformity with the SEC's final regulations once they have been promulgated. We have chosen to wait to adopt a formal policy until the SEC issues its regulations to ensure that our policy will be fully compliant with the regulations as finally adopted. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
We do not consider it appropriate for any of the Company's officers, directors or employees to enter into speculative transactions in the Company's securities that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in market value of the Company's securities. As a result, the Company prohibits officers, directors or employees from purchasing puts, calls, options or other derivative securities based on the Company's securities or its correlates. The policy also prohibits hedging or monetization transactions, such as forward sale contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Officers, directors and employees may also not purchase securities of the Company on margin, borrow against any account in which the Company's securities are held or otherwise pledge any securities of the Company. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee believes that management should have a significant ownership interest and has implemented share ownership guidelines for the named executive officers to more closely align their interests with those of stockholders. The number of shares of our common stock that an executive must own is set as a multiple of the executive's base salary. Unearned performance shares and restricted stock units and unvested restricted stock count toward an executive's ownership of our common stock under the guidelines. For the CEO, the multiple is four times base salary, while for the other named executive officers, the multiple is two times base salary, in each case with a four-year phase-in period.

Risk Mitigation 
The Compensation Committee assesses executive compensation, and particularly annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term incentive compensation, in light of corporate and operational risks facing the Company. Based on these assessments, our executive compensation program includes risk mitigating features, such as: balance between short- and long-term incentives, cash versus equity pay, fixed versus variable pay, multiple performance measures, and anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies. 
The Company's share ownership requirements for named executive officers further mitigates risk by reinforcing alignment of executives' incentives with Company performance.

[END TABLE]
Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
The financial reporting and income tax consequences to the Company of the compensation components for executive officers are considered by the Compensation Committee in analyzing the level and mix of compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") prohibits publicly traded companies from taking a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and certain of its other most highly compensated executive officers who are "covered employees" under Section 162(m). Certain "performance-based compensation" with respect to taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017 or payable pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on and not materially modified after November 2, 2017, is excluded from this $1 million cap. The Compensation Committee continues to evaluate the deductibility of executive compensation, while retaining the discretion it deems necessary to compensate the Company's executive officers as it determines appropriate. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee and management of the Company reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our 2018 Annual Report.

Several of our senior executives, including Messrs. Schanzer and Mays and Ms. Zeigler, participate in the Rabbi Trust Plan. Under this deferred compensation plan, participants may defer a portion of their cash salaries and bonuses on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on such amounts based on the performance of specific investments selected by the participants. Participants may also defer share awards made under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, as well as related dividends. In connection with this plan, the Company has established the "Rabbi Trust" wherein the trustee is directed to make investments of the deferred cash amounts which track as closely as possible to those selected by each participant in order to generally match its liabilities to the participants under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit market risk. Generally, cash deferrals will be distributed in a lump sum on the earlier of the first day of the 61st month following the end of the calendar year to which such deferral relates, or as soon as practicable after the participant's separation from service for any reason other than death or retirement (or six months thereafter, in the case of any participant who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A), unless the participant elects to receive the distribution in installments, or to otherwise further defer the distribution, as provided in the Rabbi Trust Plan. Generally, share deferrals will be distributed in a lump sum on the later of (a) the first business day of the January next following the third anniversary date of the grant, or (b) the first business day of the January next following the date on which the share deferrals are scheduled to vest in their entirety based on the original vesting schedule, unless the participant elects to receive the distribution in installments, or to otherwise further defer the distribution, as provided in the Rabbi Trust Plan. In the event of a termination or constructive termination of the Rabbi Trust Plan, such plan provides for an income tax gross up on plan benefits distributed upon such termination or constructive termination.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee has established target share ownership guidelines for our directors to more closely align their interests with those of our stockholders. For each director who has served as a director for at least four years, such director is expected to own shares of our common stock, including restricted stock, totaling not less than the number of shares constituting the equity portion of his or her annual retainer in the aggregate over the previous four years. Based on the directors' disclosure to the Company, all of the Company's 2018 directors who were beyond their four-year phase-in compliance period satisfied the share ownership requirement. In addition, Mr. Eisenstat, although still within his phase-in compliance period, already met the requisite share ownership requirement that would have applied had he been with the Company for four years or more. 
In addition, we have adopted a policy that prohibits directors from hedging or pledging securities of the Company, as described above under the heading "Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy" on page 43 above.

Ernst & Young has served as the Company's independent auditor since 1984. 
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting on behalf of the Board and has sole authority to approve all audit engagements and appointment of internal auditors, including fees and terms. Company management has primary responsibility for preparing the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process, including establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and, along with the Audit Committee, evaluating the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young is responsible for performing an independent audit of (i) the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and (ii) the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and issuing reports thereon. 
In this context, during 2018 the Audit Committee met four times and held separate discussions with management, the accounting firm that provides internal audit services to the Company and Ernst & Young. The Audit Committee met with Ernst & Young to discuss its plans and scope for the fiscal 2018 audits and also discussed the procedures and scope with the firm performing the internal audit for 2018. The Audit Committee met with the internal auditors and Ernst & Young, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal control, including the results of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, including compliance with the COSO 2013 principles, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young the critical accounting policies and practices used in the preparation of the Company's audited financial statements. Management and Ernst & Young represented to the Audit Committee that its consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee reviewed with Ernst & Young its judgments as to the quality, not just acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by the standards of the PCAOB, including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and other applicable regulations. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young the firm's independence from Company management and the Company, including the matters in the letter from Ernst & Young required by PCAOB Rule 3526, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with Ernst & Young's independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. 
The Audit Committee received and reviewed a report from the internal auditors detailing the results of such firm's internal audit procedures and the Company's compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young the Company's internal quality control procedures and any material issues raised by Ernst & Young's most recent internal quality control review. The Audit Committee, after discussions with management, approved the fees for various services performed by Ernst & Young.

AUDIT MATTERS 
The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Company's independent public accountants, both in fact and appearance. Each year, the Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the Company's independent public accountants and determines whether to re-engage the current independent public accountants. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the independent public accountants, their capabilities and their technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's operations and industry. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has retained Ernst & Young as the Company's independent public accountants for the audit of the Company's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that, due to Ernst & Young's knowledge of the Company and of the industry in which the Company operates, it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue the retention of Ernst & Young to serve as the Company's independent public accountants. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent public accountants, the Audit Committee intends to continue to recommend that the Board ask the stockholders, at this Annual Meeting, to ratify the appointment of the independent public accountants. 
Based on the review and discussions with management, the internal auditors and Ernst & Young, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements and related schedule, and management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, in the Company's 2018 Annual Report.

AUDIT MATTERS 
All audit and tax fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by the Company's auditors was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The policy of the Audit Committee provides for pre-approval of the yearly audits, quarterly reviews and tax compliance on an annual basis. As individual engagements arise, they are approved on a case-by-case basis. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more of its members pre-approval authority with respect to permitted services. 
Audit Committee Consideration of these Fees 
The Company's Audit Committee has considered whether the provisions of the services covered under the category of "Audit-Related Fees" are compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP, and concluded Ernst & Young LLP is independent.

PROPOSAL 2: APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
PROPOSAL 2: APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if such representative so desires and to respond to appropriate questions. 
Although ratification by stockholders is not a prerequisite to the power of the Audit Committee to appoint Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, our Board and the Audit Committee believes such ratification to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company. If the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee will continue to conduct an ongoing review of Ernst & Young LLP's scope of engagement, pricing and work quality, among other factors, and will retain the right to replace Ernst & Young LLP at any time. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy is required to approve this Proposal. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 98% of our stockholders approved the executive compensation of the Company. 
As described in the section, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. Our compensation programs are designed to reward our named executive officers for the achievement of short- and long-term strategic and operational goals and, for the CEO, achievement of certain TSR goals, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board or the Compensation Committee. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions that stockholders express in their votes and will review the voting results and take them into consideration as they deem appropriate when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy is required to approve this Proposal. 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at this meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED". 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
At our Annual Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by 2,000,000 shares, or from 4,000,000 shares to 6,000,000 shares (the "Plan Amendment"). The Plan Amendment was approved by the Board on February 5, 2019, subject to stockholder approval of this proposal at the Annual Meeting. The Plan Amendment is intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract, and retain the services of directors, officers, and employees upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of the Company's operation is largely dependent. No portion of the additional 2,000,000 shares may be used for grants to Mr. Schanzer, our CEO. 
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the Plan Amendment. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting either in person or by proxy is required to approve this Proposal. 
Overview of Plan Amendment and Key Features of the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan 
The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board on March 14, 2017 and approved by our stockholders on May 2, 2017 at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan implemented numerous best-practice enhancements to the Company's corporate governance practices with respect to equity compensation, including: 
Equity incentive compensation plans like the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan are an important tool to attract, retain and motivate executives and employees. Our Board believes that incentives and stock-based awards focus our employees on the objective of creating stockholder value and promoting our success over time, as well as further aligning employees' interests with those of our stockholders and encouraging their long-term commitment to the Company. 
Due to the significant and unanticipated reduction in the trading price of our common stock over the past several months, the Board has determined that the current equity share pool reserve under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan will not be sufficient for our anticipated equity award needs into 2020 and beyond. Therefore, if stockholders do not approve the Plan Amendment, our future ability to issue equity-based awards will be limited, which could have significant negative consequences for our ability to recruit and retain qualified senior employees. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  61 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
Reason for Plan Amendment 
The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan is critical to our ongoing effort to build stockholder value. Equity incentive awards are an important component of our executive and non-executive employees' compensation. Our Compensation Committee and Board believe that we must continue to offer a competitive equity compensation program as part of our overall competitive pay mix in order to attract, retain and motivate the talented and qualified employees necessary for our continued growth and success. 
In addition, our compensation philosophy reflects broad-based eligibility for equity incentive awards. Approximately 64% of our employees were eligible for equity awards as of March 8, 2019. Of the 82 eligible participants in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan as of March 8, 2019, including named executive officers and directors, approximately two-thirds of them held outstanding equity awards. By ensuring that our employees and directors hold equity awards, we link the interests of those employees with those of our stockholders and motivate our employees to act as owners of the business. 
We believe we have employed responsible grant practices over the years. Our philosophy of supporting alignment with stockholder interests through issuance of both annual and multi-year grants allows grantees to accumulate incentives to steward the Company to long-term success as it executes its strategic mission. 
Our long-term incentive practice is to grant equity-based compensation awards that have a target value equal to a dollar amount that our Compensation Committee determines is competitive with the target value of long-term incentive awards granted by our peers, taking into account our overall pay mix relative to our peers and the appropriate balance that annual cash incentives and equity awards provides in terms of short- and long-term objectives. Our equity awards are therefore a critical piece of that pay mix, which allows us to compete for the best talent possible, and to retain and drive the performance of our executives and key employees. 
Based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE on May 2, 2017, the date on which our stockholders approved the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, the aggregate market value of the 4,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan was $21,640,000. However, the stock prices of publicly traded REITs in the real estate sector, and the subsector of shopping center REITs, have declined significantly over the past 18 months, including our stock price. 
A consequence of the substantial and unanticipated decline in our stock price has been that in order to provide equity grants to key employees with a similar dollar value as those typically issued prior to the decline, we have been required to make equity grants covering substantially more shares than originally contemplated at the time the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was adopted. 
As of March 8, 2019, there were no stock options outstanding under our equity compensation plans. In addition, as of March 8, 2019, there were 2,808,182 unvested full value awards with time-based vesting and 1,500,000 unvested full value awards with performance-based vesting outstanding under our equity compensation plans. Other than the foregoing, no awards under our equity compensation plans were outstanding as of March 8, 2019. As of March 8, 2019, the Company had 365,046 shares remaining and available to grant under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. 
Equity-based compensation is a critical component of our overall competitive pay mix, which is designed to achieve the appropriate balance between short- and long-term incentives through annual cash bonuses and equity awards, respectively. While the Board has considered alternatives to the issuance of equity awards as a means to provide long-term incentives to our key employees, including the adoption of additional cash incentive programs, our Compensation Committee believes equity awards are the most effective mechanism for creating long-term incentives for value generation. Equity awards are also preferable to cash incentive awards because they do not require the near-term use of limited cash resources. Any additional cash incentive awards would place significant additional pressure on our cash reserves and liquidity position. We believe equity awards have the benefit of 
62  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
more closely aligning the interests of our directors, officers and employees with those of our stockholders, which is an important component of our compensation philosophy. A significant increase in the cash component of our long-term incentive program awards could cause significant misalignment between executive and stockholder interests. 
A copy of the proposed First Amendment to our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan is attached hereto as Annex A. 
Summary of the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended 
The following description of certain features of the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (as it would be amended as contemplated by this Proposal No. 4) is intended to be a summary only. Except for the increase in authorized shares resulting from the proposed Plan Amendment, this summary is substantially the same summary that was included in the Company's definitive proxy statement in connection with the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and no other changes are being made to the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. 
Administration. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has full power to select, from among the individuals eligible for awards, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, to make any combination of awards to participants, and to determine the specific terms and conditions of each award, subject to the provisions of the plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to grant awards to employees who are not subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and not subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, subject to certain limitations and guidelines. 
Eligibility. All full-time and part-time officers, employees, non-employee directors and other key persons (including consultants) are eligible to participate in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee. As of March 8, 2019, 82 individuals are currently eligible to participate in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, which includes three named executive officers, 73 employees who are not named executive officers, six non-employee directors and no consultants. 
Award Limits. There are certain limits on the number of awards that may be granted under the plan. For example, no more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be granted in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights to any one individual during any one calendar year period, and no more than 500,000 shares of common stock may be granted pursuant to awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights to any individual grantee in any calendar year. The maximum performance-based award payable to any grantee in a performance cycle is 2,500,000 shares of common stock. In addition, no more than 2,500,000 shares of common stock may be granted in the form of incentive stock options. 
Director Compensation Limit. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan provides that the value of all awards awarded under the plan and all other cash compensation paid by the Company to any non-employee director in any calendar year shall not exceed $750,000. For purposes of this limit, the value of any equity incentive awards made to a non-employee director shall be equal to the grant date fair value determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. 
Minimum Vesting. No portion of any equity award granted under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan may vest in less than one year, provided that up to 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the plan may be utilized for unrestricted stock awards or other equity awards with a minimum vesting period of less than one year and time-based restricted stock awards have a minimum vesting period of three years. In addition, the Compensation Committee may grant equity awards that vest within one year (i) if such awards are granted as substitute awards in replacement of other awards (or awards previously granted by an entity being acquired (or assets of which are being acquired)) that were scheduled to 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  63 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
vest within one year or (ii) if such awards are being granted in connection with an elective deferral of cash compensation that, absent a deferral election, otherwise would have been paid to the grantee within the one year. 
Stock Options. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan permits the granting of (1) options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code and (2) options that do not so qualify. Options granted under the plan will be non-qualified options if they fail to qualify as incentive options or exceed the annual limit on incentive stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Non-qualified options may be granted to any persons eligible to receive incentive options and to non-employee directors and key persons (including consultants). The exercise price of each option will be determined by the Compensation Committee but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Fair market value for this purpose will be determined by reference to the closing price of the shares of common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant. The exercise price of an option may not be reduced after the date of the option grant, other than to appropriately reflect changes in our capital structure. 
The term of each option will be fixed by the Compensation Committee and may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee will determine at what time or times each option may be exercised. Options may be made exercisable in installments and the exercisability of options may be accelerated by the Compensation Committee in circumstances involving the optionee's death, disability or retirement, a change in control or other similar event. In general, unless otherwise permitted by the Compensation Committee, no option granted under the plan is transferable by the optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and options may be exercised during the optionee's lifetime only by the optionee, or by the optionee's legal representative or guardian in the case of the optionee's incapacity. 
Upon exercise of options, the option exercise price must be paid in full either in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Compensation Committee or by delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of common stock that are beneficially owned by the optionee and that are not subject to risk of forfeiture. Subject to applicable law, the exercise price may also be delivered to the Company by a broker pursuant to irrevocable instructions to the broker from the optionee. In addition, the Compensation Committee may permit non-qualified options to be exercised using a net exercise feature which reduces the number of shares issued to the optionee by the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the exercise price. 
To qualify as incentive options, options must meet additional federal tax requirements, including a $100,000 limit on the value of shares subject to incentive options that first become exercisable by a participant in any one calendar year. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee may award stock appreciation rights subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. Stock appreciation rights entitle the recipient to shares of common stock or cash equal to the value of the appreciation in the stock price over the exercise price. The exercise price is the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The term of a stock appreciation right may not exceed ten years. 
Restricted Stock. The Compensation Committee may award shares of common stock to participants subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with us through a specified restricted period. During the vesting period, restricted stock awards may be credited with dividend equivalent rights. 
64  |      2019 Proxy Statement 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may award restricted stock units to any participants. Restricted stock units are ultimately payable in the form of shares of common stock or cash and may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Compensation Committee may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include the achievement of certain performance goals and/or continued employment with the Company through a specified vesting period. In the Compensation Committee's sole discretion, it may permit a participant to make an advance election to receive a portion of his or her future cash compensation otherwise due in the form of a restricted stock unit award, subject to the participant's compliance with the procedures established by the Compensation Committee and requirements of Section 409A of the Code. During the deferral period, the deferred stock awards may be credited with dividend equivalent rights. 
Unrestricted Stock Awards. The Compensation Committee may also grant shares of common stock which are free from any restrictions under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. Unrestricted stock may be granted to any participant in recognition of past services or other valid consideration and may be issued in lieu of cash compensation due to such participant. 
Dividend Equivalent Rights. The Compensation Committee may grant dividend equivalent rights to participants which entitle the recipient to receive credits for dividends that would be paid if the recipient had held specified shares of common stock. Dividend equivalent rights may be settled in cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof, in a single installment or installments, as specified in the award. Dividend equivalent rights may not be granted as a component of options or stock appreciation rights. 
Change in Control Provisions. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan provides that upon the effectiveness of a "sale event," as defined in the plan, all awards under the plan will automatically terminate unless the parties to the sale event agree that such awards will be assumed, continued, or substituted by the successor entity; provided that except as may be otherwise provided in the relevant award agreement or employment agreement, all awards with time-based vesting, conditions or restrictions shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the effective time of the sale event, and all awards with conditions and restrictions relating to the attainment of performance goals may become vested and non-forfeitable in whole or in part in connection with a sale event in the Compensation Committee's discretion or to the extent specified in the relevant award agreement or employment agreement. In connection with a sale event, (i) the Company may make or provide for a cash payment to participants holding options and stock appreciation rights, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, equal to the difference between the per share cash consideration in the sale event and the exercise price of the options or stock appreciation rights or (ii) each participant shall be permitted, within a specified period of time prior to the consummation of the sale event, as determined by the Compensation Committee, to exercise all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights held by such participant. The Company shall also have the option to make or provide for payment, in cash or in kind, to grantees holding other awards in an amount equal to the sale price multiplied by the number of vested shares underlying such awards. 
Adjustments for Stock Dividends, Stock Splits, etc. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan requires the Compensation Committee to make appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of common stock that are subject to the plan, to certain limits in the plan, and to any outstanding awards to reflect stock dividends, stock splits, extraordinary cash dividends and similar events. 
Tax Withholding. Participants in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan are responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes that the Company is required by law to withhold upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or vesting of other awards. Participants may elect to have withholding obligations satisfied by authorizing the Company to withhold shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to the exercise or vesting. Shares tendered in satisfaction of tax liability will no longer be available for future awards under the plan. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  65 
PROPOSAL 4: APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO 2017 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
No Repricing of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. The exercise price of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights may not be reduced or repriced in any manner without prior stockholder approval. 
Amendments and Termination. The Board may at any time amend or discontinue the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan and the Compensation Committee may at any time amend or cancel any outstanding award for the purpose of satisfying changes in the law or for any other lawful purpose. However, no such action may adversely affect any rights under any outstanding award without the holder's consent. To the extent required under the rules of the NYSE, any amendments that materially change the terms of the plan will be subject to approval by our stockholders. Amendments shall also be subject to approval by our stockholders if and to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee to be required by the Code to preserve the qualified status of incentive options or to ensure that compensation earned under the plan qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
Effective Date of Plan. The 2017 Stock Incentive Plan was originally adopted by our Board on March 14, 2017 and became effective when approved by stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 2, 2017. The Plan Amendment was approved by the Board on February 5, 2019 and will be effective once approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Awards of incentive options may be granted under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan until the tenth anniversary of March 14, 2017. No other awards may be granted under the plan after the date that is ten years from the date of stockholder approval. 
New Plan Benefits 
Because the grant of awards under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment, is within the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and possibly subject to various performance factors which cannot, as yet, be determined, the Company cannot determine the dollar value or number of shares of common stock that will in the future be received by or allocated to any participant in the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan. The following table provides information concerning the awards that were received by the following persons and groups under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan during 2018: each named executive officer; all other executive officers, as a group; all non-employee directors, as a group; and all current employees who are not executive officers, as a group.

Incentive Options. No taxable income is generally realized by the optionee upon the grant or exercise of an incentive option. If shares of common stock issued to an optionee pursuant to the exercise of an incentive option are sold or transferred after two years from the date of grant and after one year from the date of exercise, then (i) upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price (the amount paid for the shares) will be taxed to the optionee as a long-term capital gain, and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (ii) the Company will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. The exercise of an incentive option will give rise to an item of tax preference that may result in alternative minimum tax liability for the optionee. 
If shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of an incentive option are disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-year and one-year holding periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), generally (i) the optionee will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the shares of common stock at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on a sale of such shares of common stock) over the option price thereof, and (ii) we will be entitled to deduct such amount. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the incentive option is paid by tendering shares of common stock. 
If an incentive option is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies for the tax treatment described above, the option is treated as a non-qualified option. Generally, an incentive option will not be eligible for the tax treatment described above if it is exercised more than three months following termination of employment (or one year in the case of termination of employment by reason of disability). In the case of termination of employment by reason of death, the three-month rule does not apply. 
Non-Qualified Options. No income is realized by the optionee at the time the option is granted. Generally (i) at exercise, ordinary income is realized by the optionee in an amount equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of exercise, and we receive a tax deduction for the same amount, and (ii) at disposition, appreciation or depreciation after the date of exercise is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending on how long the shares of common stock have been held. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the non-qualified option is paid by tendering shares of common stock. Upon exercise, the optionee will also be subject to Social Security taxes on the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the option. 
Other Awards. The Company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by the participant at the time the participant recognizes such income. Participants typically are subject to income tax and recognize such tax at the time that an award is exercised, vests or becomes non-forfeitable, unless the award provides for a further deferral. 
Parachute Payments. The vesting of any portion of an option or other award that is accelerated due to the occurrence of a change in control (such as a sale event) may cause a portion of the payments with respect to such accelerated awards to be treated as "parachute payments" as defined in the Code. Any such parachute payments may be non-deductible to the Company, in whole or in part, and may subject the recipient to a non-deductible 20% federal excise tax on all or a portion of such payment (in addition to other taxes ordinarily payable). 
Limitation on Deductions. Under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company's deduction for certain awards under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan may be limited to the extent that the Company's "covered employees" (as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code) receive compensation in excess of $1 million a year.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP; OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS 
Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Board has adopted a written policy relating to the review, approval and ratification of transactions between the Company and related persons, pursuant to which any such transactions must be approved by the Audit Committee. The policy applies to transactions or arrangements between us and any related person, including directors, director-nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% stockholders and the immediate family members of each of these groups. In determining whether to approve a related person transaction, the Audit Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. There were no transactions during 2018 that were subject to our related person transaction policy. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires executive officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the stock of the Company to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership. Such persons are also required by Securities and Exchange Commission regulations to furnish the Company with copies of these reports. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require the Company to identify in this Proxy Statement anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent fiscal year. Based solely on our review of copies of such forms received, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no filings were required for such persons, we believe that, during 2018, the Company's executive officers, directors and holders of more than 10% of its common stock complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a).

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
At Cedar, we believe in doing well by doing good. This philosophy is reflected in our operational goals of bringing essential retail commerce, such as grocers and other important amenities, to underserved communities in densely-populated urban areas. Consistent with that philosophy, we embrace responsible environmental, social and community stewardship as an essential part of our mission to build a successful business and to shape the communities we serve throughout our portfolio, in addition to our workplace community. 
2018 was an important year in terms of demonstrating our commitment as a company to Environmental, Social and Governance Principles. Below are some of the highlights affirming our commitment to corporate social responsibility, both internally and in the markets where we operate: 
Environmental 
We are committed to sustainability initiatives, in the service of which we are continually exploring ways to bring conservation principles to our real estate projects. In 2018, we completed installation of solar energy panels on our underutilized roof areas at four of our shopping centers in three states for a total system size of 1,400 kilowatts of renewable solar energy. The conversion of two additional centers to solar energy is planned for 2019, to bring our total system size to 3,500 kilowatts, spanning four states. In addition, we completed 15 parking lot conversions to LED lighting, with another 8 LED parking lot conversions scheduled for 2019, in recognition of which the Company received a ThinkLite award in 2018 for our commitment to efficient lighting solutions. We have proposed and received approval to install electric car charging stations at three of our shopping centers in two states, in an effort to facilitate reduction in carbon footprint and fuel emissions. We have also installed trash recycling programs at 13 of our centers, recycling an estimated 688 tons of waste across our centers. We estimate that the environmental impact of our recycling program in 2018 alone was to save 11,693 mature trees, save 275,136 gallons of oil, avoid consumption of 412,704 kilowatt-hours and avoid 5,503 lbs. of greenhouse gases. 
In addition to doing our fair share for the global environment, it is our hope that our demonstrated commitment to sustainability initiatives will serve as a positive model of corporate civic responsibility in the communities we serve, and stimulate analogous efforts among our constituencies. 
Social 
As a company, Cedar has affirmed its commitment to social responsibility in numerous ways. We have added four new directors to our Board in the past four years, each of which enhances diversity with respect to gender, ethnicity or professional experience, or a combination thereof. We are proud to have one-third of our independent Board comprised of female directors. We value not only the diversity of experience these professionals bring to our Board room, but also the enriched cognitive diversity they bring to our collective approach to problem solving. In terms of our corporate culture, approximately 55% of our mid-level, non-executive managers are female, as well as nearly one-third of our executive team. 62% of our employee population was female, as of the end of 2018. 
Cedar's mission of social responsibility extends outward as well to the communities we serve. In 2018, we were proud to sponsor community cultural events such as "Art All Night," a community art installation showcasing works of urban local artists, mobile art galleries, and photography workshops for inner city children, as well to donate backpacks and school supplies to grade-school children in our communities. In addition, we are a local planning committee sponsor of REAP in New York City, a real estate associate program that fosters the entry of multicultural professionals into the commercial real estate industry. 
    2019 Proxy Statement  |  71 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Governance 
Good governance is one of our core principles, which guides our formulation of corporate policies, internal management and relationships with the communities in which we operate. Our belief in stockholder enfranchisement is demonstrated by recent corporate policy enactments which have been overwhelmingly well-received by our stockholders. For example, in 2018, we adopted amendments to our charter and by-laws which empower stockholders to act to amend our by-laws, as opposed to exclusively reserving this right to our Board. 
We have annual election of directors, with no classified Board, and a requirement that directors be elected by a majority vote in uncontested elections. Our Board committees are composed of entirely independent directors, and the average tenure of our directors has been steadily decreasing as we have refreshed our Board with new director appointments each of the last four years. 
We regularly engage with our stockholders throughout the year, and are responsive to their concerns. For example, in 2016, in response to stockholder feedback, we modified our named executive officers' employment agreements to remove "modified single-trigger" cash severance provisions and to provide instead for satisfaction of "double trigger" conditions for payment of cash severance following a change in control. We continued this feature in our new CEO and CFO employment agreements effective June 2018, and further migrated our compensation practices to align with best market practices with respect to several important features in these new executive employment agreements, detailed more fully herein. In addition, in response to constructive input from our stockholders, we require a minimum vesting period of one year applicable to all types of equity awards granted under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to a 5% carve out, and a minimum three-year vesting period for time-based restricted stock awards. We have also put into place caps on director pay in our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, which would remain in place under the current proposed amendment.

OTHER MATTERS 
OTHER MATTERS 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. The Company has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $10,500, plus all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. The Company may use the services of its directors, officers, employees and others to solicit proxies, personally or by telephone; arrangements may also be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and stockholders of record to forward solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons. The Company may reimburse such solicitors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in soliciting, but no compensation will be paid for their services. 
Stockholder Proposals 
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, must be received by the Company on or prior to November 28, 2019 to be eligible for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement and form of proxy to be used in connection with such meeting. Under Rule 14a-8, we are not required to include stockholder proposals in our proxy materials unless this condition is satisfied. Accordingly, any notice of stockholder proposals received after this date will be considered untimely. In addition, proposed nominations by stockholders for persons to serve as directors at the 2020 Annual Meeting must comply with the advance notice provisions and other requirements specified in our by-laws and be received by the Company between January 2, 2020 and February 1, 2020. Nominations not received within this time frame will be considered untimely. 
Householding 
The Company may elect to send a single copy of its 2018 Annual Report and this Proxy Statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless one of the stockholders at such address notifies the Company that he or she desires to receive individual copies. This "householding" practice reduces the Company's printing and mailing costs. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Stockholders may request to discontinue or re-start householding, or to request a separate copy of the 2018 Annual Report or 2019 Proxy Statement, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stockholders owning shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record should contact such record holder directly; and   
[END TABLE]

• stockholders of record should write to the Company at 44 South Bayles Avenue, Port Washington, New York 11050, attention:  Investor Relations, Tel. (516) 767-6492. The Company will promptly deliver such materials upon request.  
[END TABLE]
Other Business 
At the date of this Proxy Statement, the only business which the Board intends to present or knows that others will present at the meeting is that hereinabove set forth. If any other matter or matters are properly brought before the meeting, or any adjournment thereof, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote the proxy on such matters in accordance with their judgment.

The Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is hereby amended as follows: 
1.    Section 3(a) of the Plan is hereby amended by deleting such Section in its entirety and substituting the following: 
(a)    Stock Issuable. The maximum number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be 6,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 3.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares shall not be added to the shares authorized for grant under the Plan: (i) shares tendered or held back upon exercise of an Option or settlement of an Award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, and (ii) shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the Stock Appreciation Right upon exercise thereof. In the event the Company repurchases shares of Stock on the open market, such shares shall not be added to the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan. Subject to such overall limitations, shares of Stock may be issued up to such maximum number pursuant to any type or types of Award; provided, however, no more than 2,500,000 shares of Stock in the aggregate may be issued in the form of Incentive Stock Options.
