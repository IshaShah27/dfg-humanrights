Geospace Technologies Corporation 
PROXY STATEMENT 
January 4, 2019 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Geospace Technologies Corporation (the "Company") is soliciting proxies from its stockholders for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held at 10:30 a.m. on February 6, 2019, at the Courtyard by Marriott Houston NW/290 Corridor, 6708 Gessner Road, Houston, Texas 77040, and for any adjournment thereof. 
You are entitled to vote at the meeting if you were a holder of record of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") at the close of business on December 14, 2018. On January 4, 2019, stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be able to access an electronic version of a proxy card, this proxy statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report at www.edocumentview.com/geos. The Company first distributed copies of these proxy materials to stockholders on or about January 4, 2019. 
You may request a printed copy of these proxy materials by sending a written request to Geospace Technologies Corporation, 7007 Pinemont Drive, Houston, Texas 77040-6601, Attention: Secretary. Copies will be mailed to the requesting stockholder free of charge within three business days of the receipt of the request. 
On December 14, 2018, there were 13,632,791 shares of the Company's Common Stock outstanding. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder to one vote on each matter considered at the meeting. 
Your proxy card will appoint William H. Moody and Charles H. Still as proxy holders, or your representatives, to vote your shares as you indicate. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without specifying voting instructions, the proxy holders will vote your shares (i) FOR the election of Class III director nominees named in this proxy statement, (ii) FOR the ratification of the appointment by the audit committee of the Board of RSM US LLP, independent public accountants, as the Company's auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and (iii) FOR the approval of the non-binding, advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
Signing, dating and returning your proxy card does not preclude you from attending the meeting and voting in person. If you submit more than one proxy, the latest-date proxy will automatically revoke your previous proxy. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by sending written notice, to be delivered before the meeting, to: Computershare Investor Services, 350 Indiana Street, Suite 800, Golden, Colorado 80401. 
The enclosed form of proxy provides a means for you to vote for the proposals listed in this proxy statement or to withhold authority to vote for proposals. 
The Board expects the director nominees named in this proxy statement to be available for election. If any director nominee is not available, the proxy holders may vote your shares for a substitute if you have submitted a signed and dated proxy card that does not withhold authority to vote for director nominees. 
The Company is not aware of any matters to be brought before the meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If any other matters not now known are properly brought by the Company before the meeting, and if you return a signed, dated proxy card, the proxy holders may vote your shares in their discretion as to those other matters. 
A quorum is required to conduct business at the meeting. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company having voting power with respect to a subject matter (excluding shares held by the Company for its own account) present or represented by proxy will constitute a quorum at the meeting of shareholders for the transaction of business with respect to such subject matter. Each of the three director nominees will be elected if such nominee receives the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast for an open directorship so long as the number of nominees for election equals the number of nominees to be elected (an "Uncontested Election"). For the purpose of an Uncontested Election, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes "for" a nominee's election must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that nominee's election. Votes "against" a nominee's election will count as votes cast, but "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" will not count as votes cast with respect to that nominee's election. In order for any person to become a member of the Board, such person must agree to submit upon appointment or first election to the Board an irrevocable resignation, which resignation shall provide that it shall become effective (contingent upon acceptance of the resignation by the Board), in the event of a shareholder vote in an Uncontested Election in which that person does not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that person's election as a director, at the earlier of (i) the selection of a replacement director by the Board, (ii) 180 days after certification of such shareholder vote, or (iii) acceptance by the Board. If the number of nominees for director at a meeting of shareholders exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the affirmative votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors at such meeting. 
The proposals relating to the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the auditors of the Company for the 2019 fiscal year, and the resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers will pass if the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as shares present for determining a quorum, but will not be counted to determine the total number of votes cast. Broker non-votes occur when nominees, such as brokers and banks holding shares on behalf of the beneficial owners, are prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions. If you do not give instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other agent, the bank, brokerage firm or other agent will nevertheless be entitled to vote your shares of Common Stock in its discretion on "routine matters" and may give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote the shares of Common Stock in its discretion on such matters. The ratification of independent public accountants is generally a routine matter whereas the election of directors is not considered a routine matter. There are no rights of appraisal or similar dissenters' rights with respect to any matter to be acted upon pursuant to this proxy statement. 
Representatives of Computershare Investors Services, the transfer agent and registrar for the Common Stock, will act as the inspectors of election at the meeting.  PROPOSAL I: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
At the meeting, the stockholders will elect three Class III directors. The Board is divided into three classes, each class being composed as equally in number as possible. The classes have staggered three-year terms, with the term of one class expiring at each annual meeting of stockholders. 
The directors whose terms expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting are Mr. Edgar R. Giesinger, Jr., Mr. William H. Moody and Mr. Gary D. Owens. The nominating and corporate governance committee of the Company has nominated Mr. Giesinger, Mr. Moody and Mr. Owens to serve as Class III directors for a three-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee considered various criteria to evaluate the potential candidates including, without limitation, (1) independence, (2) qualification to serve on the committees of the Board, (3) experience in the seismic industry, (4) knowledge of the oil and gas industry, (5) continuing overall contributions and valuable input to the Board and its committees, and (6) a collaborative, persuasive and articulate personality. The nominating and corporate governance committee also considers such person's diversity attributes (e.g., perspectives, professional experience, experiences derived from high-quality business, skills, background and gender) as a whole and does not necessarily attribute any greater weight to one attribute. Each candidate is considered in the context of their contribution to the Board as a whole with the objective of assembling a group that best contributes to the success of the Company and represents stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment, using its diversity of perspectives, skills and experiences. After discussions, the nominating and corporate governance committee determined that Mr. Giesinger, Mr. Moody and Mr. Owens satisfied the criteria considered by the nominating and corporate governance committee, and nominated Mr. Giesinger, Mr. Moody and Mr. Owens to stand for election as Class III directors on the Board of the Company. 
Mr. Giesinger, Mr. Moody and Mr. Owens have been nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee to serve as Class III directors for a three-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The directors in Class I are serving terms that expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The directors in Class II are serving terms that expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Mr. Giesinger, Mr. Moody, Mr. Owens, Dr. Davis, Mr. Still, Ms. Langtry and Mr. Miles are independent, as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules (the "NASDAQ Rules") as currently applicable to the Company. 
The Board has determined that of the persons nominated to serve as Class III directors and also serve on the audit committee, Mr. Giesinger and Mr. Moody are independent under the criteria established by the NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission. No specific transactions existed that needed to be considered in determining the independence of Mr. Giesinger and Mr. Moody in connection with their nominations.  Information regarding the director nominees and directors whose terms will continue after the meeting follows.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
Mr. Owens serves as the Company's Chairman of the Board. Mr. Owens was the Company's previous President and Chief Executive Officer from 1997 until his retirement in December 2013. The Company has not established a written position description for our Chairman of the Board. A primary function of that position is to set the agenda for and lead meetings of the Company's Board. The Board believes that the Company will benefit from Mr. Owens' continued services as a director and as Chairman of the Board given his extensive experience with the Company's operations. 
In February 2015, the Board created a Lead Independent Director position and elected Mr. Still to serve for a three year term. In this position, Mr. Still presides over meetings of the Board when the Chairman is not present, leads at least two meetings per year of the Board's independent directors, serves as liaison between the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Board, and approves Board information, agendas and schedules. The Lead Independent Director also participates in the selection of committee members and committee chairs, stockholder communications, and the recommendation of advisors and consultants to the Board. Under the direction of Mr. Still, the independent directors met one time during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. In November 2017, after review of Mr. Still's achievements during his tenure as Lead Independent Director, the Board elected Mr. Still for another three year term. The Company believes that the Lead Independent Director position strikes an appropriate balance between Mr. Owens' significant executive, customer, and industry knowledge in his position as Chairman and the Board's fiduciary duties to stockholders. 
As a governance best practice, all members of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees are independent. The Board has established processes for the effective oversight of critical issues charged to independent Directors such as the integrity of our financial statements, senior executive compensation, succession planning, election of the Lead Independent Director, membership of independent Board committees, evaluations of the Board, committee and Directors, and nominations for Directors. 
The Company further believes that separation of the Chairman and executive officer roles allows Mr. Wheeler to focus his time and energy on operating and managing the Company while leveraging the experience and perspectives of the Chairman. The Board has an active role in evaluating the Company's risk management in its ongoing business by regularly reviewing information presented by management regarding the Company's business and operations risks and monitoring risk areas through Board reports and related discussions at Board meetings. The Board also reviews and approves the Company's operating and capital budgets on an annual basis. The committees of the Board include an audit committee, which oversees accounting and financial issues and risks, a compensation committee, which reviews leadership performance and compensation, and a nominating and corporate governance committee, which assesses Board performance and corporate governance issues.

 PROPOSAL II : RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS 
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 the Company retained BDO USA, LLP ("BDO"), independent public accountants, to provide audit services to the Company. 
On February 27, 2018, the Company dismissed BDO as its independent registered accounting firm and retained RSM US LLP ("RSM") as its independent registered public accounting firm for and with respect to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Such dismissal of BDO as the Company's independent registered accounting firm and appointment of RSM as its independent registered public accounting firm was approved by both the audit committee and the Board 
The report of BDO on the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 (as restated) and 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of an opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit report of BDO on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 contained an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting due to a material weakness regarding its failure to design and maintain controls over the classification of inventory, which resulted in a restatement of financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 and through February 27, 2018, there were: (i) no disagreements with BDO on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and (ii) no "reportable events" (as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except for the material weakness reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 related to the Company's lack of adequate controls concerning the classification of current assets with respect to inventories. The audit committee discussed the subject matter of the foregoing material weakness with BDO, and the Company authorized BDO to respond fully to any inquiries concerning such matters made by RSM. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 and through the date of the Company's engagement of RSM, neither the Company nor anyone on behalf of the Company consulted with RSM regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or proposed transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, and no written or oral advice was provided by RSM that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or event, as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
The audit committee appointed RSM to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2019, and such appointment was approved by the Board. 
The Company previously provided BDO with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested that BDO furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not it agrees with the statements in the above paragraphs. A copy of BDO's letter was attached as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2018. 
In consideration of audit services provided, the Company paid BDO and RSM the amounts specified under the heading "Independent Public Accountants" in this proxy statement. 
In the event the appointment of RSM is not ratified, the audit committee will consider the appointment of other independent auditors. A representative of RSM is expected to be present at the annual meeting and will be available to make a statement if such representative desires to do so and to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board recommends voting "FOR" this proposal.  Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which operates under a written charter adopted by the entire Board, serves as the representative of the Board for general oversight of the Company's financial accounting and reporting process, system of internal control, audit process and process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and the Company's standards of business conduct. The Company's management has primary responsibility for preparing the Company's financial statements and for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP ("RSM"), is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
In this context, the Audit Committee hereby reports as follows: 
1) The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018 with management and RSM. 
2) The Audit Committee has discussed with RSM the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." 
3) The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding RSM's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with RSM their independence. 
4) Based on the review and discussion referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of the Company, and the Board of Directors approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
Each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent as defined under the Securities and Exchange Commission independence rules and the listing standards of the NASDAQ market exchange.  Independent Public Accountants 
BDO served as the Company's principal independent public accountants for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. RSM served as the Company's principal independent public accountants for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. A representative of RSM is expected to attend the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees 
The aggregate fees billed by BDO for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, including for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the reviews of the financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q were $76,969 during the 2018 fiscal year and $470,746 during the 2017 fiscal year. 
The aggregate fees billed by RSM for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, including for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the reviews of the financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q were $390,000 during the 2018 fiscal year. 
The Company uses firms other than BDO and RSM for certain of its statutory audit-related services for its international subsidiaries. 
Audit-Related Fees 
There were no fees billed by BDO and RSM for audit-related services for the 2018 or 2017 fiscal years. 
Tax Fees 
The aggregate fees billed by RSM for professional tax services rendered to the Company with respect to the 2017 fiscal year were $80,108. Such services were primarily for tax compliance. RSM was not the Company's principal independent public accountant for the 2017 fiscal year. The Company used a firm other than BDO and RSM for its tax services for the 2018 fiscal year. 
All Other Fees 
There were no fees billed by BDO or RSM for other services not disclosed above for the 2018 or 2017 fiscal years. 
Compatibility of Certain Fees with Independent Accountants' Independence 
The audit committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures pursuant to which the engagement of the Company's independent accountant is approved. Such procedures govern the ways in which the audit committee will pre-approve audit and various categories of non-audit services that the independent accountant provides to the Company and its subsidiaries. In accordance with this policy, the audit committee had given its approval for the provision of audit services by RSM for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Services which have not received pre-approval must receive specific approval of the audit committee. The audit committee is informed of each such engagement in a timely manner, and such procedures do not include delegation of the audit committee's responsibilities to management. The audit committee also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by RSM was compatible with maintaining such firm's independence, and after such review, authorized RSM's selection as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. All audit contracts that were entered into in fiscal year 2018 were pre-approved by the audit committee.  PROPOSAL III : ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, at the meeting, the stockholders will vote on a non-binding, advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
The Company believes that its compensation policies and procedures are competitive, focused on pay-for-performance and strongly aligned with the long-term interests of its stockholders. This advisory stockholder vote, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation the Company pays its named executive officers through voting for or against the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's 2019 proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, (which disclosure includes the Overview of Company Compensation, the Summary Compensation Table and the other executive compensation tables and related discussion)." 
The Company and the compensation committee remain committed to the compensation philosophy, policies and objectives outlined under the heading "Overview of Company Compensation" in this proxy statement. As always, the compensation committee will continue to review all elements of the executive compensation program and take any steps it deems necessary to continue to fulfill the objectives of the program. 
Stockholders are encouraged to carefully review the "Overview of Company Compensation" section of this proxy statement for a detailed discussion of the Company's executive compensation program. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company or the Board. However, the compensation committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. Additionally, your advisory vote will not be construed (i) as overruling a decision by the Company or the Board, (ii) to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Company or the Board, (iii) to create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Company or the Board, or (iv) to restrict or limit the ability of shareholders to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation. 
The Board recommends voting "FOR" this proposal.  Smaller Reporting Company 
Because the Company qualifies as a "smaller reporting company" under the SEC rules, the Company has elected to prepare this proxy statement and other annual and periodic reports as a "Smaller Reporting Company" pursuant to the rules of the SEC. Under the scaled disclosure obligations, the Company is not required to provide, among other things, Compensation Discussion and Analysis and certain other tabular and narrative disclosures relating to executive compensation.

Mr. Wheeler's and Mr. Sheen's background is described above under "Background of Nominees and Continuing Directors." 
Overview of Company Compensation Executive Compensation Program 
Objectives of Compensation Programs 
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly talented and experienced management personnel and to reward management for the Company's successful financial performance and for increasing stockholder value. The Company provides compensation and incentives through a combination of salaries, annual performance bonuses and long-term incentive stock-based awards. 
Executive officers generally receive the same benefits as other employees. Any differences are typically due to position, seniority, or local requirements. Consistent with this philosophy, executive officers receive minimal perquisites. Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen, and McEntire have entered into employment agreements with the Company, which, under certain circumstances, provide them with certain severance benefits upon their terminations of employment. See "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control" below for more information on these benefits. The Company's compensation policies are designed to enhance financial performance and stockholder value by aligning the financial interests of the executive officers and employees with those of its stockholders.  What the Company's Compensation is Designed to Reward 
The Company's compensation program is designed to reward teamwork and each individual's contribution to the Company, including the impact of such contribution on the Company's overall financial performance, as well as to produce positive long-term results for its stockholders and employees. 
Administration 
The compensation committee is composed of four independent members of the Board. No compensation committee member participates in any of the Company's employee compensation programs. The Company's non-employee directors are eligible to and do participate in its 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"). The compensation committee (i) sets and recommends annual compensation, including equity awards, for Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen, and McEntire to the full Board for approval, (ii) reviews and approves the overall compensation policy, philosophy and strategy for all other employees, and (iii) reviews and approves awards under equity incentive plans and the non-equity incentive program to all employees as recommended to the compensation committee by management. 
During fiscal year 2015, in response to discussions with one of the Company's institutional investors regarding the structure of its compensation program, and more specifically performance-based equity grants, the compensation committee hired Frederic W. Cook & Co, Inc., an independent compensation consultant (the "Compensation Consultant"), to advise it on such matters. The Compensation Consultant performed an evaluation of the Company's compensation program concerning future performance-based equity grants and how to balance those grants with base salary and cash bonus compensation. As a result of such advice, the compensation committee determined that, beginning in the Company's 2016 fiscal year, annual equity grants should be made to executive officers and such grants should include elements of performance intended to closely align executive incentives with the interests of the stockholders. In order to maintain prior levels of total executive compensation which the Board believes are appropriate for the Company's executive officers and to offset the cost of such annual equity grants, the Company reduced the availability of cash bonus awards to each senior executive officer. These performance based equity grants are further described below under the heading "Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation" below. The compensation committee again retained the Compensation Consultant to advise the Company on its performance-based equity grants at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved, by a non-binding, advisory resolution, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. The compensation committee considered this resolution of the stockholders in its review of executive compensation in fiscal year 2018 and determined that the stockholders supported the compensation packages awarded to the Company's named executive officers and the objectives and policies by which those packages were determined. Pursuant to a resolution adopted by the stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders will have an opportunity to approve or withhold approval of executive compensation by a non-binding advisory resolution on an annual basis at each annual meeting of stockholders. 
Elements of Compensation 
General 
The primary elements of the executive compensation program consist of (1) base salary, (2) annual cash bonuses pursuant to a non-equity, incentive annual bonus program, and (3) long term incentives in the form of equity-based compensation awards. Equity-based compensation awards have historically included nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards. Each executive officer's current and prior compensation is considered in setting future compensation and, while consideration is given to the vesting and value of previously granted equity-based compensation awards, the total compensation package is not regularly adjusted for such values. In addition, the Company focuses on the relative roles of the executive officers throughout the organization when determining compensation.  The Company chooses to pay each element of compensation to reward executives through various means. The base salary and employee benefits compensate executives for their daily efforts as management of the Company. The annual cash bonus program, described in more detail below, encourages executives to not only meet goals for the Company, measured in terms of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus), but also encourages other employees to meet goals as well. The equity-based compensation awards provide a long term incentive to executives and other key employees to improve the performance of the Company as viewed by the market as reflected in the market price for the Company's common stock. 
An executive officer's annual base salary and annual cash bonus do not fluctuate as a result of increases or decreases in the market value of equity-based compensation awards. For example, if the stock price has grown significantly, resulting in large potential gains on vested stock awards, an executive officer's base salary or bonus potential is not adjusted for that reason. However, the compensation committee may consider those gains in awarding additional equity-based compensation. Similarly, the compensation committee would not consider a large cash bonus award under the Company's annual bonus program or the Executive Officer Annual Bonus Plan to be a reason to reduce the equity-based compensation awards or annual base salary received by the executive in the following fiscal year. The Company views each compensation element as a different means of encouraging and promoting performance. These compensation elements are designed to work in tandem. 
The compensation committee considers the base salary levels supplemented by bonus awards and equity compensation in evaluating the total executive compensation package. The executive officers are encouraged to earn their bonus and equity compensation in order to realize the full value of their compensation package. The Company intends that the attainment of the performance goals established by the compensation committee will benefit its stockholders. 
The compensation committee does not believe that there is another public company that is a direct peer to the Company in the seismic industry. The Company is a manufacturer of seismic products and does not provide traditional seismic services or maintain a seismic library, like other similar companies. One of the Company's most direct competitors is a subsidiary of a much larger company, and there is no access to compensation information of the subsidiary alone. The compensation committee from time to time does review publicly available information on other seismic industry and other energy industry participants to help understand the marketplace in which the Company competes. The Compensation Consultant assists the committee in gathering executive compensation information from a broad group of energy industry companies. The compensation committee strives to maintain a reasonable compensation package for each executive officer and uses this information to retain such officer and provide incentives for such officer to continue to improve the Company's performance in the future. 
The conclusion of the compensation committee after its most recent examination of the publicly available executive compensation of energy industry companies was that the Company's total compensation of each of its executive officers, particularly their base salaries, were typically lower than the compensation of executive officers in other energy industry companies, adjusting for various factors such as size, location and seniority of the executive officer. The Company places a high priority on the retention of its key employees, particularly its executive officers. The Board of the Company believes that these executive officers have made significant contributions to the growth and development of the Company and have developed a synergy among themselves that fosters progress and support. The Board believes that a loss of any one of these executive officers could have a significant adverse impact on the Company. Based upon these considerations, the compensation committee designed compensation packages for the Company's executive officers. 
Relative Size of Major Compensation Elements 
The combination of base salary, annual cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards comprise total direct compensation. In setting named executive officer compensation, the compensation committee considers the aggregate compensation payable to the executive officer and the form of the compensation. The   compensation committee seeks to achieve the appropriate balance between immediate cash rewards and incentives for the achievement of both annual and long-term financial and non-financial objectives. 
Generally, the compensation committee targets overall compensation packages for the Company's executive officers that are competitive with the total value received by executive officers at other energy companies. Due to the nature of the Company's business and the compensation committee's use of performance based stock options, performance based restricted stock unit awards, and a performance based annual cash bonus plan, it is possible for its executive officers to receive substantial financial rewards when the Company's stock price increases and total shareholder return and financial performance hurdles are met. Conversely, in years when the Company's stock price remains unchanged or total shareholder return and financial performance hurdles are not met, its executive officers will receive minimal financial compensation, if any, in addition to their base salaries. The compensation committee attempts to maintain annual base salary ranges that are intended to keep salaries consistent and reasonably competitive with salaries at other energy industry companies, therefore improving the likelihood of retaining the executive officers. In consultation with the Compensation Consultant and after reviewing energy industry compensation data, the compensation committee has decided to target base compensation between 40% and 50% of the executive officer's overall compensation package, equity grants between 40% to 50%, and the remaining 10-15% in cash bonus tied directly to the Company's financial performance. The compensation committee believes that this blend strikes an appropriate balance between providing competitive base compensation, retention motivation and appropriate incentives to executive officers.

[END TABLE]
Annual Performance Bonuses 
For fiscal year 2018, the Board adopted comprehensive company-wide bonus compensation criteria (the "2018 Bonus Criteria") for all employees. The 2018 Bonus Criteria, which follows the same principles, goals and criteria as in the bonus program and criteria previously established for prior fiscal years, set forth various targets and criteria for the Company's operating performance and established a cash bonus, assessed on an individual basis, for employees of the Company. The financial targets were designed to provide incentives for the employees to work as a team to improve the Company's financial results. 
Under the 2018 Bonus Criteria, every employee of the Company is eligible to participate in Tier I of the Bonus Plan, except for employees in the Russian Federation who participate in a local plan. Under Tier I, employees share proportionally in the Company's profits based on each employee's relative payroll. The Tier I bonus pool is established by accruing approximately 16% of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) above a specified range. Various management teams, including the executive officers, and selected key employees are eligible to participate in Tier II of the 2018 Bonus Criteria, which applies after Tier I is fully funded. The Tier II bonus pool is established by accruing approximately 16% of consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) within a specified range above Tier I. Under Tier II, certain participants share in the bonus pool depending on the satisfaction of predefined goals by their respective working groups. None of the named executive officers were required to satisfy individual predefined goals under the 2018 Bonus Criteria. Tier I bonuses are paid if the Company reaches a predetermined pretax profit (before bonus) level. Tier II is based on attaining a predetermined consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) level as well as, in most cases (but not in the case of named executive officers), specific performance criteria of the group eligible for the bonus. The predetermined pretax profits (before bonus) levels as well as the specific performance criteria are re-evaluated annually. The groups eligible for Tier II bonuses in one year are not necessarily eligible the following year. The eligible groups are selected based on management's goals for improvement across the Company. 
The Company's named executive officers were not required to achieve individual performance targets in order to earn their respective annual cash incentive payments under the 2018 Bonus Criteria. However, the   consolidated pretax profits (before bonus) of the Company must reach a predetermined threshold before Tier I or Tier II bonus payments will be made. The difficulty of attaining the performance criteria fluctuates in response to the Company's industry, market and overall performance. While each of Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen, and McEntire has the ability to influence the Company's financial performance, none of them can ensure that the Company's performance will rise to the level of satisfying the Tier I or Tier II thresholds. During fiscal year 2018, no Tier I or Tier II bonuses were funded or paid. 
Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company believes that long-term incentive compensation is an important component of its compensation program and that the value of this compensation should be directly related to increases in stockholder value. In addition to base salaries and annual performance bonuses, the executive officers have historically participated in the 1997 Key Employee Stock Option Plan, as amended, and its successor plan, the 2014 Plan, which allow the Company to grant long-term incentive compensation to its executive officers and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards, and other awards. 
Historically, equity incentive compensation awards were determined based on an individual's annual compensation and his or her contribution to the Company. The compensation committee independently sets and recommends stock option grants, restricted stock awards, and RSU awards for the Company's executive officers to the full Board for approval. Proposals for stock option, restricted stock awards, and RSU awards to non-executives is presented by the President and Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the compensation committee. Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Sheen abstain from voting with respect to their own compensation and grants of equity awards. 
As discussed above under "Administration", the compensation committee hired the Compensation Consultant to assist in reviewing the Company's prior equity grants to the Company's senior executive officers and to make recommendations regarding future equity grants. In connection with this review, on November 26, 2018, at the recommendation of the compensation committee, the Board adopted a new restricted stock unit award agreement ("Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement") for RSU awards to its senior executive officers and key non-executives. Under the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, awards of RSUs may include time-based vesting and performance goal based vesting provisions. Additional details can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2018. 
On November 16, 2017, the Company granted restricted stock awards, with Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Sheen receiving awards in the amount of 18,500 shares each, and Mr. McEntire receiving an award of 16,800 shares. The restricted stock awards vest in four equal annual installments beginning November 16, 2017. No performance-based stock options were awarded in fiscal year 2018. 
The Board and the compensation committee intend to make annual grants of RSU awards to the Company's senior executive officers which may include time-based vesting and performance based vesting provisions to be determined by the compensation committee each year. The compensation committee will review the long-term incentive program each year to ensure that the key elements of the program continue to meet the objectives described above. RSU awards represent a contingent right to receive one share of Common Stock upon vesting. 
Benefits 
The Company offers a variety of health and welfare and retirement programs to all eligible employees. Executive officers generally are eligible for the same benefit programs on the same basis as the rest of the broad-based employees. The health and welfare programs are intended to protect employees against catastrophic loss and encourage a healthy lifestyle. The Company's health and welfare programs include medical, wellness,   pharmacy, dental, life insurance and accidental death and disability. Each employee receives life insurance equal to the employee's annual salary with a maximum payout of $100,000 and accidental death and dismemberment coverage. 
The Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. The plan covers all full-time employees who meet age and service requirements. The plan provides for pre-tax, elective employee contributions with a matching contribution from us ranging from 50% to 100% of employee contributions, up to a maximum of 3.5% of the employee's annual salary. 
The Company offers vacation time determined by years of service. As of September 30, 2018, Mr. Sheen had accrued 242 hours of vacation; Mr. McEntire had accrued 126 hours of vacation; and Mr. Wheeler had accrued 266 hours of vacation. Employees, including executive officers, may roll over up to 160 hours of unused vacation time to subsequent years. 
Perquisites 
As described above, the Company maintains life insurance policies on each named executive officer for the benefit of such executive's family members. The maximum payout under each of these policies is $100,000. The Company also maintains key man life insurance policies on each executive officer exclusively for its benefit. Additionally, the Company provides promotional shirts, hats and Company logo golf balls to employees for use at Company-sponsored events and exhibitions. The Company may, during years when the Company is meeting its financial goals, reimburse the executive officers for the travel expenses of each executive's spouse to attend certain annual geophysical conferences in North America and Europe. 
Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatment 
A standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board requires a public company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The equity awards the Company grants are structured to comply with the requirements of the standard to maintain the appropriate equity accounting treatment. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation paid in excess of $1,000,000 for any fiscal year to the corporation's chief executive officer and three other most highly compensated executive officers as of the end of any fiscal year (other than the Chief Financial Officer). However, qualifying "performance-based compensation" was exempted from the $1,000,000 deduction limit if certain requirements were met. 
Historically, the compensation committee designed certain components of executive compensation to qualify as "performance-based compensation" to ensure full deductibility. However, the compensation committee reserved the right to pay compensation that did not meet the "performance-based compensation" requirements because the compensation committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the compensation committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even though such programs might have resulted in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, the compensation committee has from time to time approved elements of compensation for certain officers that are not fully deductible and reserved the right to do so in the future in appropriate circumstances. 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which, among other things, generally repealed the qualifying "performance-based compensation" exception described above for years beginning after December 31, 2017, and, in addition, expanded the group of executive officers covered by including the Chief Financial Officer and certain former executive officers. Following enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we generally expect that compensation paid to our applicable named executives in excess of $1 million will not be deductible, subject to an exception for compensation provided pursuant to a binding   written contract in effect as of November 2, 2017. However, given the uncertain scope of the binding written contract transition relief and the absence of rulemaking at this time, the impact of the elimination of the performance-based compensation exemption from Section 162(m) with respect to outstanding performance awards and other pre-2018 performance incentives paid after 2017 is not yet known. The compensation committee expects that Section 162(m) will become less of a factor in designing executive compensation with the repeal of the performance-based compensation exemption. 
Section 409A of the Code, as amended ("Section 409A"), provides that deferrals of compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for all taxable years are currently includible in gross income to the extent not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not previously included in gross income, unless certain requirements are met. The Company intends to structure any deferred compensation items to be in compliance with Section 409A.

Employee Equity Incentive Plans 
In February 2014, the Board and stockholders approved the 2014 Plan, which replaced the 1997 Key Employee Stock Incentive Plan. 
The 2014 Plan is administered by the compensation committee. Under the 2014 Plan, the compensation committee may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock. The purchase price of shares subject to an incentive option granted under the 2014 Plan is determined by the compensation committee and may not be less than the greater of: (a) 100% of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date the option is granted or (b) the aggregate par value of the shares of Common Stock on the date the option is granted. The compensation committee in its discretion may provide that the price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under an incentive option shall be more than 100% of fair market value. In the case of any 10% stockholder, the price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under an incentive option shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the incentive option is granted. The price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under a nonqualified option shall not be less than the greater of: (a) 100% of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date the option is granted or (b) the aggregate par value of the shares of Common Stock on the date the option is granted. The compensation committee in its discretion may provide that the price at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased under a nonqualified option shall be more than 100% of fair market value. 
Options granted under the 2014 Plan must be exercised within ten years from the date of grant. In the case of a 10% stockholder, no incentive option shall be exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date the incentive option is granted. 
Generally, awards granted under the 2014 Plan are not transferable by the holder other than by will or under the laws of descent and distribution. Options granted under the 2014 Plan, if vested, terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration date of the option or (ii) one day less than three months after the date the holder of the option terminates his or her employment with us for any reason other than the death, disability or the retirement of such holder. During such three-month period the holder may exercise the option in respect of the number of shares that were vested on the date of such severance of employment. In the event of severance because of the death, disability or retirement of a holder before the expiration date of the option, the option terminates on the earlier of such (i) expiration date or (ii) one year following the date of severance. During this period the holder, or his or her heirs, as the case may be, generally may exercise the option in respect of the number of shares that were vested on the date of severance because of death, disability or retirement. 
At September 30, 2018, an aggregate of 691,388 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

Clawback Policy 
The Company believes it is important to foster and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability. For this reason, the Board adopted a clawback policy effective December 15, 2016. This policy applies to all current and former executive officers. The policy applies to equity grants awarded under the 2014 Plan, regardless of when such awards were granted, as well as annual bonuses and any other compensation earned or vested based on the attainment of a financial reporting measure. 
In the event the Company restates its financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, a person covered by this clawback policy will be required to reimburse or forfeit certain incentive compensation received. The amount to be reimbursed or forfeited will be the amount of the incentive compensation paid or awarded to the person based on the erroneous financial data exceeding the amount that would have been paid based on restated results, as determined by the Board. The Board will also determine the method for recouping such amounts, which may include: (1) requiring reimbursement of cash incentive compensation previously paid to the person, (2) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, sale or other disposition of any equity-based awards, (3) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the person, (4) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards made to the person, and/or (5) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
Pursuant to their employment agreements, as amended, each of Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen and McEntire is entitled to receive the severance benefits described below upon termination of his employment unless the termination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• results from his death, disability or retirement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is by the Company for Cause; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is by the employee other than for Good Reason.  
[END TABLE]
"Cause" is defined to mean the employee's willful and continued failure to perform his duties after a demand for his performance of those duties or the employee's willfully engaging in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. "Good Reason" is defined to mean a demotion, a reduction in base salary, a relocation of the employee's base location of employment, the discontinuation of any employee benefit without comparable substitution, the failure of any successor of the Company to assume the employment agreement or a purported termination not in compliance with the employment agreement.  The severance benefits to which Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen, and McEntire would be entitled on termination would be an amount equal to the product of (a) his then-current annual salary plus the average of the bonus payments paid to the executive in respect of the three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, multiplied by (b) two. The executive would also receive any relocation and indemnity payments to which he is entitled and any costs and legal fees incurred in connection with any dispute over his employment agreement. In the case of Mr. Sheen, a gross-up for any applicable "excess parachute payment" tax imposed by the Code would also be received. 
These payments would be due in a lump sum on the tenth day following the date of termination. The amounts paid are based on the salary rate in effect at the time of termination, unless the employee is terminating employment for Good Reason due to a reduction in salary, in which case the salary rate shall be the rate in effect prior to such reduction. 
So long as Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen or McEntire are terminated without Cause, they are not required to perform any further agreement or action in order to receive these benefits. However, in connection with these employment agreements, each of them have agreed that he will not disclose or misappropriate any confidential information of the Company and that all intellectual property developed by them is the property of the Company. 
If the employment of any of Messrs. Wheeler, Sheen or McEntire had been terminated on September 30, 2018, the terminated employee would have received the amount set forth in the table below in a lump sum payment plus any relocation and indemnity payments to which he is entitled. In the case of Mr. Sheen, the terminated employee would additionally be entitled to receive any costs and legal fees incurred in connection with any dispute over his employment agreement, and a gross-up for any applicable "excess parachute payment" tax imposed by the Code.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
The Board has established written procedures and adopted policy for governing related persons transactions. The Company's general code of business conduct, to which all employees (including its executive officers) are subject, also provides that no employee nor any employee's immediate family member should engage in a business or financial arrangement with a vendor, supplier or customer of the Company without the prior written approval of the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.

The types of transactions covered by the procedures are transactions, arrangements, or relationships, including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness to which the Company or any of its   subsidiaries were or will be a participant, and any related person had, has or will have direct or indirect interest with respect to certain relationships and related transactions. The audit committee is responsible for establishing/reviewing related party transaction policies and reviewing and approving related party transactions. 
Transactions Involving Richard F. Miles 
The Company regularly transacts business with Creative Marketing Services, LP ("CMS"), a company owned by the spouse of director Richard F. Miles. CMS is a marketing company which has historically provided marketing, communications, and support services to the Company, including product photography, video shoots, brochure design, magazine advertising, website design, annual report production and various other marketing and advertising services. The Company had retained CMS prior to Mr. Miles' appointment as director in 2013. For the Company's 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, the Company incurred expense of $13,000, $7,000, and $39,000 respectively, to CMS for these services. The Board has determined that these services provided to the Company do not render Mr. Miles not independent under applicable NASDAQ rules. 
Mr. Miles was previously the Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Geokinetics Inc. ("Geokinetics"), a customer of the Company. On November 8, 2012, Mr. Miles retired from his positions with Geokinetics. Between October 1, 2011 and the date of Mr. Miles' retirement from Geokinetics, the Company sold an aggregate amount of $3.8 million of equipment to Geokinetics in 139 separate transactions, and the Company rented equipment to Geokinetics in seven separate transactions with an aggregate rental fee of $7.1 million. The transactions were on terms similar to those that the Company would provide to customers of Geokinetics' size. During this period, Geokinetics was not indebted to the Company except for payment terms generally provided to customers of the Company relating to Geokinetics' purchases of equipment. 
Geokinetics subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in May of 2013. 
On November 16, 2017, the Board agreed that Mr. Miles had become independent according to the applicable NASDAQ rule and that his relationship with CMS would not interfere with his exercise of independent judgement in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. 
Based solely on a review of reports on those filings furnished to the Company and written representations from reporting persons that no additional reports were required, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, all officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them.

A matter as to which the Company receives notice that is proposed to be brought before the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in 2020 outside the process of the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule on stockholder proposals (described in the preceding sentence) will be considered not properly brought before that meeting, and will be out of order, unless the notice as to that matter meets the requirements of the advance notice provisions of the Company's by-laws. That provision requires notice of any matter, including nomination of a director, to be submitted by a stockholder at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company in 2020 to be received by the Company no later than November 8, 2019, and to be received by the Company no earlier than October 9, 2019, subject to certain other requirements and deadlines outlined in the Company's by-laws.
