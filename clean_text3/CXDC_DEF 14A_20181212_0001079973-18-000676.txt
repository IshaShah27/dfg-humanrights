A list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting may be examined at the Company's office during the 10-day period preceding the Annual Meeting.
This proxy statement and the proxy card are being mailed on or about December 17, 2018 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date.
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING
Who can vote?
Holders of our Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock or Series D Preferred Stock, as of close of business on December 12, 2018, the Record Date, may vote at the Annual Meeting.  As of the close of business on the Record Date, a total of 50,448,841 shares of Common Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and 16,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  The shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Capital Stock") will vote together as a single class on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting except for the election of the Series D Directors, which the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will vote on together as a separate class. Each share of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote.  The holder of the Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to an aggregate of 44,632,561 votes, representing 40% of the combined voting power of the entire Company's shares.
If I am a stockholder of record, how do I cast my vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. We will provide you a ballot on your arrival.
If you do not wish to vote in person or you will not be attending the Annual Meeting, you may vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card. To vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card, complete, sign and date your proxy card and promptly return it in the envelope provided.
If you vote by proxy, your vote must be received by 4:00 a.m. Beijing time on December 28, 2018, or 3:00 p.m. US Eastern Standard Time on December 27, 2018.
How do I vote by proxy?
Follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card to vote on each proposal to be considered at the Annual Meeting.  Sign and date the proxy card and mail it back to us in the enclosed envelope.
The enclosed proxy, when properly signed and returned to the Company, will be voted by the proxy holders at the Annual Meeting as directed by the proxy.  Proxies which are signed by stockholders but which lack any such direction will be voted in favor of the proposals set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting.
What if other matters come up at the Annual Meeting?
The matters described in this proxy statement are the only matters we know of that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting.  If other matters are properly presented at the meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares as they see fit.
Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card?
Yes.  You may revoke your proxy card at any time before its exercise at the Annual Meeting by providing our Secretary a written notice revoking your proxy card or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attendance at the Annual Meeting and electing to vote in person.
Can I vote in person at the Annual Meeting rather than by completing the proxy card?
Although we encourage you to complete and return the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted, you can attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. How are votes counted?
The Annual Meeting will be held if holders representing a majority of the shares of Capital Stock issued and outstanding, who are entitled to vote in person or by proxy, either sign and return to us their proxy cards or attend the meeting.  If you sign and return to us your proxy card, your shares will be counted to determine whether a quorum exists, even if you abstain or fail to vote on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card.
The election of the directors under Proposal 1 who are not the Series D Directors requires a plurality of the votes duly cast at the Annual Meeting.  "Plurality" means that the individuals who receive the largest number of votes cast "for" are elected as directors.  The election of the two (2) Series D Directors under Proposal 1 requires a plurality of the votes duly cast by the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock.  Abstentions will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum but will have no effect on this Proposal 1. The approval of Proposals 2 and 3 require a majority of the votes duly cast at the Annual Meeting.  Abstentions will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum but will have no effect on Proposals 2 and 3.  Unless otherwise stated, the enclosed proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon.
Brokers holding shares of the Common Stock in street name who do not receive instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares are entitled to vote on "routine" proposals such as the ratification of the Company's independent auditors but are not entitled to vote your uninstructed shares in the election of directors on a discretionary basis.  Thus, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your broker or other nominee how to vote in the election of directors as described in this proxy statement, no votes on the election of directors will be cast on your behalf for Proposals 1 and 2.  Your broker or other nominee will, however, have discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on the ratification of KPMG Huazhen LLP as our independent auditor for Proposal 3.
Who pays for this proxy solicitation?
We will pay for expenses incurred in proxy solicitation, estimated to be US$15,000  In addition to sending you these materials, some of our employees may contact you by telephone, by mail, by fax, by email or in person.  None of these employees will receive any extra compensation for contacting you.  We may reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding these proxy materials to stockholders.
Why are we seeking stockholder approval for these proposals?
Proposal No. 1:  The Nevada Revised Statutes and The Nasdaq Stock Exchange require corporations to hold elections for directors each year.
Proposal No. 2: The Company offers its stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the 2017 compensation of the named executive officers.
Proposal No. 3:  The Company has appointed KPMG Huazhen LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year 2018.  The Company elects to have its stockholders ratify such appointment.
What rights of appraisal or similar rights of dissenters do I have with respect to any matter to be acted upon at the meeting?
No action is proposed herein for which the laws of the State of Nevada or our bylaws provide a right to our stockholders to dissent and obtain appraisal of, or payment for, such stockholders' Capital Stock. OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING RIGHTS
Stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof, are stockholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date.  Persons who are not stockholders of record on the Record Date will not be allowed to vote at the Annual Meeting.  At the close of business on the Record Date there were 50,448,841  shares of Common Stock, 1,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and 16,000,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.  We have issued no other voting securities as of the Record Date.  Each share of Common Stock and Series D Preferred Stock is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting.  The holder of the Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to an aggregate of  44,632,561 votes, representing 40% of the combined voting power of the entire Company's shares.  The holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect the Series D Directors.

The Company has adopted a policy whereby the Audit Committee or another independent body of the Board of Directors first reviews and approves or takes such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and in which any director, executive officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404, which currently apply to transactions (or any series of similar transactions) in which the amount involved exceeds US$120,000.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires the executive officers and directors of the Company and every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of security of the Company to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such persons also are required to furnish our company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on our review of copies of such forms received by us, we believe that during the fiscal year 2017, all of the executive officers and directors of the Company and every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of security of the Company complied with the filing requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
None of our directors and officers has been involved in any of the legal proceedings specified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years.
BOARD OPERATIONS
Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors believes that Jie Han's service as both Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Mr. Han possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities, and challenges facing the Company, and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the time and attention of our Board of Directors are focused on the most critical matters. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the Company's ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to the Company's stockholders, employees and customers.
Each of the directors other than Jie Han, Taylor Zhang and Qingwei Ma is independent (see "Director Independence" below), and the Board of Directors believes that the independent directors provide effective oversight of management. The Board of Directors has not designated a lead director.  Our independent directors call and plan their executive sessions collaboratively and, between Board of Directors meetings, communicate with management and one another directly.  In the circumstances, the directors believe that formalizing in a lead director functions in which they all participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors. Director Qualifications
We seek directors with established strong professional reputations and experience in areas relevant to the strategy and operations of our businesses.  We also seek directors who possess the qualities of integrity and candor, who have strong analytical skills and who are willing to engage management and each other in a constructive and collaborative fashion, in addition to the ability and commitment to devote significant time and energy to service on the Board of Directors and its committees.  We believe that all of our directors meet the foregoing qualifications.
The Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the leadership skills and other experiences of its Board of Directors members, as described above under "INFORMATION ABOUT THE NOMINEES AND QUALIFICATIONS," provide the Company with a range of perspectives and judgment necessary to guide our strategies and monitor their execution.
Board of Directors Practices
            Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. The primary responsibilities of our Board of Directors are to provide oversight, strategic guidance, counseling and direction to our management. It is our expectation that the Board of Directors will meet regularly on a quarterly basis and additionally as required. We encourage our directors to attend annual meetings of stockholders and believe that attendance at annual meetings is just as important as attendance at meetings of the Board. Eight directors attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company.
Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight
The Board of Directors as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant Board of Directors committees. These committees then provide reports to the full Board of Directors.  The oversight responsibility of the Board of Directors and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board of Directors about the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks.  These areas of focus include strategic, operational, financial and reporting, succession and compensation, compliance, and other risks.  The Board of Directors and its committees oversee risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility, as summarized below.
MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors held 9 meetings during 2017. No director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors. No director attended less than 75% of any meeting of a committee of which the director was a member for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
A majority of the directors serving on our Board of Directors must be independent directors under Rule 5605(b)(1) of the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"). The Board of Directors has a responsibility to make an affirmative determination whether a director has a material relationship with the listed company through the application of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ, which provides the definition of an independent director.
The Board of Directors has determined that each of the director nominees standing for election, except Jie Han, Taylor Zhang and Qingwei Ma, has no relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and is an "independent director" as defined in the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In determining the independence of our directors, the Board of Directors has adopted independence standards that follow the criteria specified by applicable laws and regulations of the SEC and the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ. In determining the independence of our directors, the Board of Directors considered all transactions in which the Company and any director had any interest, including those discussed under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" above.
Based on the application of the independence standards and the examination of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Board of Directors determined that none of the following directors and nominees had any material relationship with the Company and, thus, are independent under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ:   Joseph Chow, Linyuan Zhai, Homer Sun, Jun Xu and Feng Li. In accordance with the Marketplace Rules of NASDAQ, a majority of our Board of Directors is independent. BOARD COMMITTEES

On September 28, 2011 the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (amended on January 24, 2014 and filed with the Secretary of the State of the State of Nevada on January 27, 2014), which provides the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock with the right to elect up to two (2) directors to the Company's Board of Directors on the terms and conditions set forth therein.  There have been no other changes to the procedures by which the stockholders of the Company may recommend nominees to the Board of Directors since the filing of the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on November 19, 2009 for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held on December 1, 2009. The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by any reasonable source, including current Board of Directors members, stockholders, professional search firms or other persons.  The directors will not evaluate candidates differently based on who has made the recommendation.  The Board of Directors does not have a formal policy on Board of Directors candidate qualifications.  The Board of Directors may consider those factors it deems appropriate in evaluating director nominees made either by the Board of Directors or stockholders, including judgment, skill, strength of character, experience with businesses and organizations comparable in size or scope to the Company, experience and skill relative to other Board of Directors members, and specialized knowledge or experience in business or financial matters as would make such nominee an asset to the Board of Directors and may, under certain circumstances, be required to be "independent," as such term is defined in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and applicable SEC regulations.  Depending upon the current needs of the Board of Directors, certain factors may be weighed more or less heavily.  In considering candidates for the Board of Directors, the directors evaluate the entirety of each candidate's credentials and do not have any specific minimum qualifications that must be met.
Security holders wishing to submit the name of a person as a potential nominee to the Board of Directors must send the name, address, and a brief (no more than 500 words) biographical description of such potential nominee to the Nominating Committee at the following address: Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, c/o China XD Plastics Company Limited, 500 5th Avenue, Suite 938, New York, New York 10110.  Potential director nominees will be evaluated by personal interview, such interview to be conducted by one or more members of the Nominating Committee, and/or any other method the Nominating Committee deems appropriate, which may, but need not include a questionnaire.  The Nominating Committee may solicit or receive information concerning potential nominees from any source it deems appropriate.  The Nominating Committee need not engage in an evaluation process unless (i) there is a vacancy on the Board of Directors, (ii) a director is not standing for re-election, or (iii) the Nominating Committee does not intend to recommend the nomination of a sitting director for re-election.  A potential director nominee recommended by a security holder will not be evaluated any differently than any other potential nominee.  Although it has not done so in the past, the Nominating Committee may retain search firms to assist in identifying suitable director candidates.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following is a discussion and analysis of our named executive officer compensation program for the year ended December 31, 2017 detailing what we pay to our named executive officers and how our compensation objectives and policies help achieve our business objectives.
Overview of Compensation Program
Our Compensation Committee has responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence to our compensation philosophy and objectives. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is fair, reasonable and competitive. Our compensation decisions with respect to executive officer salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentive opportunities are influenced by (a) the officer's level of responsibility and function; (b) our overall financial performance and, in some cases, the officer's business unit; and (c) our assessment of the competitive marketplace, including other peer companies. Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
All of our compensation programs, including our executive compensation programs, are designed to attract and retain key employees in the highly competitive modified plastic marketplace in China. Our executive compensation programs are also designed to motivate our executives to achieve and reward them for superior performance in attaining corporate and individual objectives that create stockholder value. Different programs, including both cash and stock-based compensation, are geared towards short-term and long-term performance, respectively, with the goal of aligning employee interests with stockholder interests and increasing stockholder value over the long term. Executive compensation programs impact all employees by setting general levels of compensation and creating an environment of goals, reward and expectations. Finally, we endeavor to ensure that our compensation programs are viewed as fundamentally fair to our stockholders.
Elements of Compensation
Elements of compensation for our named executive officers include base salary, non-equity incentive compensation, equity incentive awards, pension plan, health, disability and life insurance and certain other perquisites. We use salary as the base amount necessary to match our competitors for executive talent. We utilize cash incentive payments to reward performance achievements over the course of a one-year horizon and we use equity incentive awards to reward long-term performance, with excellent corporate performance and extended tenure producing potentially significant value for our named executive officers. We believe that this combination of programs provides an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay, balances short-term operational performance with long-term stockholder value, and encourages executive recruitment and retention.
Compensation Process
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring the compensation of our named executive officers. When making compensation decisions, our Compensation Committee analyzes the dollar amount of each component of the executive officer's compensation, including current cash compensation (base salary and non-equity plan incentive compensation), long-term equity incentive program compensation, and any other compensation.
Except as set forth below, our Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between long-term and currently paid out compensation, or between cash and non-cash compensation. However, our philosophy is to pay our executive officers competitive levels of compensation that best reflect their individual responsibilities and contributions to us.
We choose to pay each element of compensation in order to attract and retain necessary talent, reward annual performance (on an individual, business unit and enterprise-wide basis) and provide incentives for achieving long-term strategic goals as well as short-term objectives. The amount of each element of compensation is determined by our Compensation Committee in consultation with our CEO with respect to the other named executive officers, and, with respect to the CEO, by our Compensation Committee. Compensation decisions for all named executive officers take into account the following factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance against corporate and individual objectives for the previous year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Value of skills and capabilities to support our long-term performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance of general management responsibilities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Contribution as a member of our executive management team.  
[END TABLE]
 Consideration of Say-on-Pay Vote Results.
Shareholders are provided with the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders indicated their support for the compensation of our named executive officers, with a majority of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal voted for the proposal. No additional changes were made to the executive compensation program for 2017 in consideration of this result. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.
Compensation Risk Assessment
Management and the Compensation Committee regularly evaluate the risks associated with our compensation programs and will consider changes necessary to prevent incentives to take excessive risk. As a result of our most recent evaluation, we do not believe that our compensation programs created risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. To the contrary, we believe that the programs promote sound business judgment and align employee performance with the realization of the Company's strategic plan and maximization of shareholder value.
The "named executive officers" are the following CEO, CFO and three other most highly-compensated executive officers other than CEO and CFO as of the end of fiscal year 2017:

 On May 26, 2009, we adopted the Plan, under which 7,800,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance.  The Plan provides for the grant of the following types of incentive awards: (i) stock options and (ii) stock issuances. Each of these is referred to individually as an "Award." Those who are eligible for Awards under the Plan include employees, directors and independent contractors who provide services to the Company and/or its affiliates.
Number of Shares of Common Stock Available Under the Plan
             The Board of Directors has reserved 7,800,000 shares of the common stock for issuance under the Plan. As of December 31, 2017,  3,789,376 stock awards and 670,500 stock options have been granted under the Plan.  Currently, approximately 92  employees and directors are eligible to participate in the Plan.
If the Company declares a dividend or other distribution or engages in a recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Company's Common Stock, the Board of Directors will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the Plan, the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical per-person limits on Awards.
Shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options shall be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent (1) the options expire or terminate for any reason prior to exercise in full or (2) the options are cancelled in accordance with the Plan. Unvested shares issued under the Plan and subsequently repurchased by the Corporation, at a price per share not greater than the option exercise or direct issue price paid per share, pursuant to the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall accordingly be available for reissuance through one or more subsequent option grants or direct stock issuances under the Plan. The Company did not issue this stock award the service rendered during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Administration of the Plan
The Board of Directors will administer the Plan. However, any or all administrative functions otherwise exercisable by the Board of Directors may be delegated to a committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"). Members of the Committee shall serve for such period of time as the Board of Directors may determine and shall be subject to removal by the Board of Directors at any time. The Board of Directors may also at any time terminate the functions of the Committee and reassume all powers and authority previously delegated to the Committee.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Board of Directors has the sole discretion to select the employees, independent contractors, and directors who will receive Awards, determine the terms and conditions of Awards, and to interpret the provisions of the Plan and outstanding Awards.
Options
The Board of Directors is able to grant nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options under the Plan. The Board of Directors determines the number of shares subject to each option. Incentive options may only be granted to employees.  The aggregate fair market value of the shares of Common Stock for which one or more options granted to any employee under the Plan may for the first time become exercisable as incentive options during one calendar year may not exceed US$100,000.
The Board of Directors determines the exercise price of options granted under the Plan, provided the exercise price (i) of incentive stock options must be at least equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and (ii) of non-statutory stock options must be at least equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. In addition, the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to any participant who owns more than 10% of the total voting power of all classes of the Company's outstanding stock must be at least 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date. The term of an option may not exceed ten years, except incentive stock options granted to an employee who is a 10% stockholder may not exceed five years.
Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, after a termination of service with the Company, a participant will be able to exercise the vested portion of his or her option for (i) 90 days following his or her termination (or within such other period of time as may be specified by the Company, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the option term) for reasons other than death, disability or misconduct, (ii) one year following his or her termination (or within such other period of time as may be specified by the Company, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the option term) due to death or disability. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or Board of Directors, if a participant ceases to be employed by the Company on the account of  termination by the Company for defined misconduct, any option held by the participant shall terminate on the date on which the participant ceases to be employed by, or provide service to, the Company, or the date on which such option would otherwise expire, if earlier.
The Administrator shall have the discretion to grant options that are exercisable for unvested shares.  Should the optionee's service cease while the shares issued upon the early exercise of the optionee's option are still unvested, the Company shall have the right to repurchase any or all of the unvested shares in accordance with the Plan.
             Stock Issuance
The Board of Directors may transfer shares of Company stock to a Plan participant pursuant to a stock issuance, either through the immediate purchase of such shares or as a bonus for services rendered the Company.  Stock issuances will vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. The Board of Directors will determine the number of shares granted pursuant to an Award of stock.  Vesting conditions on stock issuances granted to non-officer employees may not be more restrictive than 20% per year vesting, with the initial vesting to occur no later than one year after the shares are issued.
The Board of Directors shall fix the purchase price per share of stock issuance.  Shares issued to 10% stockholders must not have a purchase price per share less than 100% of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of issuance.  Shares issued to other Plan participants shall not be less than 85% of the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of issuance.
The participant shall have full stockholder rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued to the participant under the Plan, whether or not the participant's interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to receive any regular cash dividends paid on such shares.
Should the participant cease to remain in service while holding one or more unvested shares issued under the Plan or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares, then the Company has the right to repurchase the unvested shares at the lower of (a) the purchase price paid per share or (b) the fair market value per share on the date participant's service ceased or the performance objective was not attained. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable shall be established by the Board of Directors and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right.
The Board of Directors may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares (or other assets attributable thereto) which would otherwise occur upon the non-completion of the vesting schedule applicable to those shares. Such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the participant's interest in the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant's service ceases or he or she attains the applicable performance objectives. Transferability of Awards
Except as described below, Stock Option Awards granted under the Plan are generally not transferable, and all rights with respect to a Stock Option Award granted to a participant generally will be available during a participant's lifetime only to the participant. A participant may not transfer those rights except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Participant may transfer non-statutory stock options to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members or to a transferee's former spouse, consistent with applicable securities laws, provided that the participant receives no consideration for the transfer of an option and the transferred option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the option immediately before the transfer.
The Company has the right of first refusal with respect to any proposed disposition by an optionee or a participant of any shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan.  Such right of first refusal shall be exercisable and lapse in accordance with the terms established by the Board of Directors and set forth in the document evidencing such right.
Change of Control
In the event of a change of control, each outstanding option which is at the time outstanding automatically will become fully vested and exercisable and be released from any restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights, and the restrictions and conditions on all outstanding stock issuances will lapse immediately prior to the specified effective date of such change of control, for all of the shares at the time represented by such option or stock issuance. An outstanding option shall not so fully vest and be exercisable and released from such limitations and a stock issuance will not be released from such restrictions and restrictions on stock issuances if and to the extent: (i) such option or stock issuance is, in connection with the change in control, either to be assumed by the successor corporation or parent thereof or to be replaced with a comparable option, stock appreciation right or stock issuance with respect to shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof, or (ii) such option or stock issuance is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation or parent thereof which preserves the compensation element of such option or stock issuance existing at the time of the change in control and provides for subsequent payout in accordance with the same vesting schedule applicable to such option or stock issuance. The determination of option or stock issuance comparability under clause (i) above will be made by the Board of Directors.
Effective upon the consummation of the change of control, all outstanding options or stock issuances under the Plan will terminate and cease to remain outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor company or its parent.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
The Board of Directors will have the authority to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, except that shareholder approval will be required for any amendment to the Plan to the extent required by any applicable laws. No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the participant and the Board of Directors and which agreement must be in writing and signed by the participant and the Company. The Plan will terminate on May 26, 2019, unless the Board of Directors terminates it earlier or it is extended by the Company with the approval of the shareholders.
Although there may be adverse accounting consequences to doing so, options may be granted and shares may be issued under the Plan which are in each instance in excess of the number of shares of Common Stock then available for issuance under the Plan, provided any excess shares actually issued under those programs shall be held in escrow until there is obtained stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan. If such stockholder approval is not obtained within twelve months after the date the first such excess grants or issuances are made, then (1) any unexercised options granted on the basis of such excess shares shall terminate and (2) the Company shall promptly refund to the optionees and the participants the exercise or purchase price paid for any excess shares issued under the Plan and held in escrow, together with interest (at the applicable Short Term Federal Rate) for the period the shares were held in escrow, and such shares shall thereupon be automatically cancelled.

In addition, in the event that the employer terminates the employment in violation of the PRC Labor Contract Law, the applicable severance compensation for termination should be two times the aforementioned amount.  Furthermore, certain non-compete payment obligation may also apply upon termination of an employment, which payment amount pursuant to the Company's standard non-compete agreement, if so entered into with the said employee, is one third the monthly base salary prior to the termination of such employee per month for 24 months following the termination.

CEO Pay Ratio
Our 2017 CEO to median employee pay ratio is 1:29.4. Our CEO had 2017 annual total compensation of US$918,580 , while our median employee had 2017 annual total compensation of US$26,957,425.
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the all employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions or estimates with respect to total compensation, but we did annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were hired during 2017 so that we could compare data on a similar basis. We believe the use of all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure that allowed us to efficiently identify the median employee in order to calculate the CEO pay ratio. We define "total compensation" as the aggregate of salary, bonus, stock awards, option awards, and "all other compensation", as applicable, as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table above.
REQUIRED VOTE
Election of the directors who are not Series D Directors requires a plurality of the votes duly cast at the Annual Meeting.  Election of the two (2) Series D Directors requires a plurality of the votes duly cast by the holders of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF
