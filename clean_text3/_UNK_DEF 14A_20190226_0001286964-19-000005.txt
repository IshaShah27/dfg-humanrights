[END TABLE]
SECTION I - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE
2019 ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
Q.What is a proxy?
A.It is your legal designation of another person to vote the units you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated two of our officers as proxies for the 2019 annual meeting. These officers are Paul Enstad and Rodney Wilkison.
Q.What is a proxy statement?
A.It is a document that Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to vote by mail or by fax by signing and returning a proxy card designating Paul Enstad and Rodney Wilkison as proxies to vote on your behalf.
Q. Why did I receive this proxy statement?
A: The board of governors is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 annual meeting because you were a member of the Company at the close of business on the record date. In order to be considered a member, you must hold a minimum of 2,500 units. If you own fewer than 2,500 units, you are considered to be a non-member unit holder and have no rights except financial rights with respect to the units you own. We currently have 66 non-member unit holders that own an aggregate of 36,488 Class A units.
Q. Who can attend the annual meeting?
A:All members as of the close of business on the record date may attend the 2019 annual meeting.
Q. What is the record date for the 2019 annual meeting and what does it mean?
A: The record date for the 2019 annual meeting is February 15,  2019.  The record date is established by the board of governors as required by the Company's operating agreement and the Minnesota Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act set forth in Chapter 322C of the Minnesota Statutes. Owners of record of units at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of the meeting and vote at the meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the 2019 annual meeting.
Q.How many membership units are outstanding on the record date?
A: On February 28, 2019, there were 77,932,107 units of the Company issued and outstanding, consisting of 62,932,107 Class A units and 15,000,000 Class B units. There are no other classes of units outstanding.  Under the Company's operating agreement, the Class A units and the Class B units are identical with respect to voting rights and privileges and vote together as one class.  Therefore, when we refer to "units", unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to the Class A units and Class B units collectively.
Under our operating agreement, only members may vote at the 2019 annual meeting.  We currently have 66 non-member unit holders that own an aggregate of 36,488 Class A units.  Therefore, the total number of outstanding units held by voting members is 77,895,619 units.
As of the mailing date of this proxy statement, the Board is aware of only one proposal that will be presented to the members for action at the 2019 annual meeting: the election of one governor. Under our operating agreement,  any member who is entitled to appoint a governor pursuant to Section 5.3(a)(iv) of the operating agreement (an "appointing member"), and such appointing members' affiliates, are not entitled to vote for the election of any governors.  As of the record date, Project Viking, L.L.C. ("Project Viking"), a wholly owned subsidiary and affiliate of Granite Falls Energy, LLC ("Granite Falls Energy"), is the only member entitled to appoint governors under Section 5.3(a)(iv) of our operating agreement.  Therefore, the 39,475,824 units controlled directly and indirectly (through Project Viking) by Granite Falls Energy by are excluded from voting in the election of governors. As a result, the total number of units outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of directors, the only proposal before the members at the 2019 annual meeting,  is 38,419,795 units.
Q:How many votes do I have?
A:Members are entitled to one vote for each membership unit owned by such member as of the close of business on the record date on any matter which may properly come before the meeting.
Q.How do I vote?
A.Membership units can be voted only if the holder of record is present at the 2019 annual meeting either in person or by proxy. You may vote using either of the following methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Proxy card. The enclosed proxy card is a means by which a member may authorize the voting of his, her, or its membership units at the 2019 annual meeting. The membership units represented by each properly executed proxy card will be voted at the 2019 annual meeting in accordance with the member's directions. The Company urges you to specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on your enclosed proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
After you have marked your choices, please sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    §      By mail to Christianson PLLP, Attention: Christina Boike, at 302 SW 5th Street, Willmar, MN 56201. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    §      By fax to Christianson PLLP, Attention: Christina Boike, at (320) 235-5962.  
[END TABLE]
If you sign and return the proxy card without specifying any choices, your membership units will be voted FOR the incumbent governor nominees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· In person at the 2019 annual meeting.  All members may vote in person at the 2019 annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Q. What am I voting on?
A: Members will vote on one proposal at the 2019 annual meeting: the election of one governor. Robert Ferguson, the incumbent governor, has been nominated by the nomination and governance committee for re-election at the 2019 annual meeting.  Detailed information on Messr. Ferguson is provided below at "SECTION II - PROPOSAL TO BE VOTED ON,  Election of  One Governor". The board of governors believes the nominee is well qualified to serve as a governor of the Company and recommends a vote FOR  Messr. Ferguson.
As stated above, any appointing member, and such appointing members' affiliates, are not entitled to vote for the election of any governors.  Therefore,  Project Viking, the only member entitled to appoint governors under our operating agreement, and its parent and affiliate, Granite Falls Energy, are not entitled to vote for the election of governors.
As of the mailing date of this proxy statement, the Board is not aware of any matters, other than those set forth above, that may be presented for action at the 2019 annual meeting. If other matters are properly presented, including voting to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting to solicit additional proxies with respect to any proposal or for any other reason, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with the member's directions.
Q:What are the voting requirements for the proposal?
A:The nominee for governor will be elected if such nominee receives an affirmative vote of the members holding at least a majority of the units present, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 annual meeting.  The nominee receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected governor; provided, however, that the nominee must receive an affirmative vote of members holding at least a majority of the units present, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 annual meeting (excluding units controlled by Granite Falls Energy and its affiliates).    You may vote "FOR" or "WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN" with respect to the nominee. Members are not entitled to cumulate their voting power for the election of governors.
A  "WITHHOLD/AGAINST" vote with respect to any nominee will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and will have the same effect as a vote against the nominee.
Q:What can I do if I change my mind after I submit my proxy?
A:You may revoke your proxy by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Voting in person at the 2019 annual meeting; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Giving written notice of revocation that is received by Christianson PLLP by 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, March 19,  2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Giving written notice of the revocation to Stacie Schuler, the Company's Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") or her designee(s), at the commencement of the 2019 annual meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Simply attending the 2019 annual meeting will not revoke your proxy; you must revoke your proxy one of the ways described above. If you would like to change your vote, you may do so by revoking your proxy and then voting in person or by proxy as described in the immediately preceding question.
Q:What happens if I mark too few or too many boxes on the proxy card?
A:If you do not mark any choices on the proxy card, then the proxies will vote your units FOR Messr. Ferguson, the incumbent governor nominee. If you mark contradicting choices on the proxy card, such as both FOR and WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN for a nominee, your votes will not be counted with respect to the governor candidate.
If any other matters are properly presented to the 2019 annual meeting for action, including voting to adjourn or postpone the annual meeting to solicit additional proxies with respect to any proposal or for any other reason, the proxy will vote the proxy cards in accordance with members' directions therein.  As provided on the proxy card, a member may grant discretionary authority to the proxies to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. Q: How will a quorum be established the 2019 annual meeting?  
A:To transact any business at the 2019 annual meeting, we must have a quorum of members present at the meeting.  A majority in interest of members, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum necessary for the transaction of business at the 2019 annual meeting. "Majority in interest" means members holding more than 50% of the units then held by all members.  
Because there is an aggregate total of 77,895,619 units held by members (which excludes units held by non-member unit holders), quorum for the 2019 annual meeting requires that 38,947,810 units be represented at the meeting in person or by proxy.  If you submit a properly executed proxy, then you will be considered part of the quorum even if you are not physically present at the meeting.
Q. Do I have dissenters' rights to any matter acted upon during the 2019 annual meeting?
A: No. Neither the election of governors, nor the advisory vote on executive compensation, is a circumstance in which the Minnesota Limited Liability Company Act or the Company's Operating agreement provides members with dissenters' rights.
Neither the Company's operating agreement nor the Minnesota Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act provides for any dissenters' rights for our members.
Q:Who will count the vote?
A:The Company has hired the accounting firm of Christianson PLLP to count the votes.
Q:How do I nominate a candidate for election as a governor or make a proposal for next year's annual meeting?
A:This question is answered in the section of this proxy statement entitled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION; Member Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting."
Q:Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
A:The entire cost of this proxy solicitation will be borne by the Company.  The cost will include the cost of supplying necessary additional copies of the solicitation material for beneficial owners of membership units held of record by brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees and their nominees and, upon request, the reasonable expenses of such record holders for completing the mailing of such material and report to such beneficial owners.
Q:How can I find out results of the voting at the 2019 annual meeting?
A:Preliminary voting results will be announced at the 2019 annual meeting.  In addition, final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file within four business days after the 2019 annual meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements that involve future events, our future performance and our expected future operations and actions.  In some cases you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "may," "will," "should," "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "plan," "future," "intend," "could," "estimate," "predict," "hope," "potential," "continue," or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are only our predictions and involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those described in this proxy statement and our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Our actual results or actions could and likely will differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the reasons described in this proxy statement.  We are not under any duty to update the forward-looking statements contained in this proxy statement.  We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.  We caution you not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this proxy statement.  You should read this proxy statement and the documents that we reference in this proxy statement, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect.  We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
SECTION II - PROPOSAL TO BE VOTED UPON
ELECTION OF ONE GOVERNOR
Our Board consists of nine elected governors, which includes four elected governors and five appointed governors.  In addition, we have three alternate governors to our Board - one alternate to our elected governors and two alternates to the appointed governors.  The alternate to our elected governors is appointed collectively by our elected governors.  The alternate governors to the appointed governors are appointed by the appointing member.  Additional information regarding our Board and our continuing governors is set forth below under the sections entitled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION, Board of Governors and Company Governance."
Under our Operating Agreement, the elected governors' terms (other than the alternate to the elected governors) are staggered such that so that one-third of the governors (or as nearly as possible) are elected by the members at each annual meeting.    Our elected governor nominees are nominated by the elected members of the Board, following consideration by our Board's nominating committee, and then elected by our members. 
Upon the recommendation of the nomination and governance committee, the Board has nominated Robert Ferguson,  an incumbent governor, for election.  The board of governors has determined that Messrs.  Ferguson is qualified to serve as a governor and has indicated his willingness to serve as a governor if elected. The Board recommends a vote FOR re-election of Messr.  Ferguson at the 2019 annual meeting.
Under the operating agreement, appointing members, and such appointing member's affiliates, are not entitled to vote for the election of governors.  As of the record date, Granite Falls Energy, as a result of its 100% ownership of Project Viking, is the Company's sole appointing member and has appointed five governors to the board of governors pursuant to this right.  Accordingly, Granite Falls Energy (and Project Viking) is not entitled to vote for the election of a governor.  Detailed information regarding the governors appointed by Granite Falls Energy is provided below under "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION, Board of Governors and Company Governance."
Except for the appointment right described above, we know of no arrangements or understandings between a governor or nominee and any other person pursuant to which he has been selected as a governor or nominee. There is no family relationship between any of the nominees, our governors or our executive officers.
Information Regarding the Nominee
Set forth below is certain information with respect to the nominees for governor, including the business experience and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills, our Board believes qualifies these individuals to serve as governors. Biographical information for non-nominee governors whose terms continue beyond the 2019 annual meeting may be found below at "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION, Board of Governors and Company Governance - Biographical Information for Governors Continuing in Office".
Robert Ferguson, Age 70 - Incumbent Governor Nominee. Mr. Ferguson has served as a governor of the Company since our inception. Since 1972, Mr. Ferguson has farmed near Heron Lake, Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson was formerly a Jackson County Commissioner and served on the Jackson County Planning and Zoning board and the Prairieland Economic Development board. In addition, he is a member of the Jackson County Corn and Soybean Associations. Mr. Ferguson attended Worthington Community College to pursue his associate of arts degree in business administration but just after graduation was drafted by the U.S. Army to serve in the Vietnam War. Mr. Ferguson was an original member of the Company's founding Board and formerly served as the Company's president and chief executive officer from 2007 to 2013. Mr. Ferguson also served as one of the Company's appointed managers to the board of managers of Agrinatural from 2011 through March 2018.  Due to his former leadership as the Company's chief executive officer, Mr. Ferguson has a significant depth of understanding of the Company's operations. Mr. Ferguson was selected as a nominee based on his prior experience with the Company along with his experience in commodities and agribusiness knowledge. Mr. Ferguson is not an "independent director" under the NASDAQ Capital Market standards (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system) because he sold a significant amount of grain to us in fiscal year 2018 as discussed below under the section titled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION; Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions".
Messr.  Ferguson does not serve as a director of any other company having a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor does he serve as a director of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Effect of Your Proxy
There is one nominee and one open seat for governor.  Therefore, you may only mark one voting choice with respect to each nominee, either "FOR" or "WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN".  If you mark "WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN", is has the same effect as a vote against that nominee.  If you just sign and submit your proxy without voting instructions, your units will be voted "FOR" for Messr. Ferguson, the incumbent nominee for governor. If you mark contradicting choices on your proxy card such as both "FOR" and "WITHHOLD/ABSTAIN" for a nominee, your votes will not be counted with respect to that nominee. FOR EACH PROPERLY EXECUTED PROXY CARD WHERE THE MEMBER DOES NOT MARK ANY CHOICES FOR GOVERNOR, THE PROXIES WILL VOTE FOR THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR NOMINEE ROBERT FERGUSON.
 If at the time of the 2019 annual meeting,  a nominee is unable or declines to serve, the proxies will vote for the election of such substitute nominee as the elected governors of the Board may recommend. Our Board has no reason to believe that any substitute nominee(s) will be required.
Required Vote and Board Recommendation
Under our Operating Agreement, the nominee for governor will be elected if such nominee receives an affirmative vote of the members holding at least a majority of the units present, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 annual meeting. Members are not entitled to cumulate their voting power for the election of governors.  
Any member who is entitled to appoint one or more governors pursuant to Section 5.3(a)(iv) of our Operating Agreement, and such appointing member's affiliates, are not entitled to vote for the election of governors.  Project Viking, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Granite Falls Energy, is the only appointing member of the Company.  Accordingly, the 39,420,949 units directly and indirectly (through Project Viking) held by Granite Falls Energy are excluded in determining the outcome of the vote for the election of governors. 
The board believes the nominee is well qualified to serve as a governor of the Company.  THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR ROBERT FERGUSON. SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF GOVERNORS, NOMINEES, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS
The following table provides certain information as of February 28, 2019, with respect to the unit ownership of: (i) those persons or groups (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) who beneficially own more than beneficial owners owning or holding 5% or more of our outstanding units; (ii) each governor of the Company, (iii) each named executive officer of the Company (as defined in the "Summary Compensation Table" below); and (iv) all officers, governors, and nominees, as a group.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires our officers and governors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  Officers, governors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  The Company is required to disclose in this Proxy Statement any failure to file or late filings of such reports with respect to the most recent fiscal year.
Based solely upon a review of copies of forms furnished to the Company or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for such covered persons, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to each covered person were satisfied during the 2018 fiscal year.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Except as disclosed below or "Compensation Of Governors" and "Compensation Of Executive Officers," we have not entered into any transaction since the beginning of fiscal year 2018 and there are no currently proposed transactions, in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  The term "related person" as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K refers to our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our outstanding units and the immediate family members of any of those persons.  No direct family relationships exist between any of the governors of the Board, officers, or key employees of the Company.
Corn Transactions
In the ordinary course of business, we regularly enter into transactions to buy grain. From time to time, we may buy grain from related persons on the same basis as we buy grain from unrelated parties. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, we purchased approximately $14.8 million of corn from board members, consisting of approximately $554,000 from Robert Ferguson, approximately $94,000 from Michael Kunerth, and approximately $14.2 million in grain from Schmitz Grain, Inc., which is controlled by our governor Doug Schmitz. Management Services Agreement with Granite Falls Energy
On July 31, 2013, we entered into a management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy for the purpose of sharing certain management employees. The management services agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless and until the Company or Granite Falls Energy gives the other party 90 days' written notice of termination prior to expiration of the initial term or the start of a renewal term. The management services agreement may also be terminated by either party for cause under certain circumstances.
Under the management services agreement, Granite Falls Energy supplies its personnel to act as part-time officers and managers of the Company for the positions of chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and risk manager. In return, we pay Granite Falls Energy 50% of the total salary, bonuses and other expenses and costs (including all benefits and tax contributions) incurred by Granite Falls Energy for the three management positions, paid on an estimated monthly basis with a "true-up" following the close of Granite Falls Energy's fiscal year.  Granite Falls Energy is responsible for and agreed to directly pay salary, wages, and/or benefits to the persons providing management services under the management services agreement. The total costs that the Company incurred under the management services agreement for fiscal year 2018 was approximately $449,000.
Review and Approval of the Transactions with Project Viking and Granite Falls Energy
The transactions and agreements with Granite Falls Energy described above, were reviewed and approved by a Special Committee of the board of governors. The Special Committee was comprised of Robert J. Ferguson, Doug Schmitz, David J. Woestehoff, Michael S. Kunerth and Milton J. McKeown. The governors serving on the Special Committee had no personal interest in the transactions contemplated by the management services agreement or related transactions. The governors serving on the Special Committee also were not affiliated with Granite Falls Energy or Project Viking or any of their respective affiliates
Process for Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
The charter of our audit committee provides that the audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the terms and conditions of all of transactions that we enter into in which an officer, governor or any member holding greater than 5% or any affiliate of these persons has a direct or indirect material interest. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is applicable to all of our employees and governors, also prohibits our employees, including our executive officers, and our governors from engaging in conflict of interest transactions. Requests for waivers by our executive officers and governors from the provisions of, or requests for consents by our executive officers and governors under, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics must be made to the audit committee.
In addition, in December 2007, we adopted a formal related person transaction approval policy, which sets forth our policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of any transaction required to be reported in our filings with the SEC. Our policy applies to any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which our company is a participant and in which a related person has a direct or indirect interest. Through the policy, the audit committee has also identified and pre-approved certain transactions with related persons, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· employment and compensation of our executive officers or governor compensation, if required to be reported in under the disclosure requirements of the SEC; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

The audit committee must approve any related person transaction subject to this policy before commencement of the related party transaction. If pre-approval is not feasible, the audit committee may ratify, amend or terminate the related person transaction. The audit committee will analyze the following factors, in addition to any other factors the Committee deems appropriate, in determining whether to approve a related party transaction:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· whether the transaction would require a waiver of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
[END TABLE]
The audit committee may, in its sole discretion, approve or deny any related person transaction. Approval of a related person transaction may be conditioned upon our company and the related person taking such precautionary actions, as the audit committees deems appropriate.
BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND COMPANY GOVERNANCE
Board Leadership Structure
The Company is managed by a chief executive officer that is separate from the chairman of the Board. Steve Christensen is our chief executive officer, while Paul Enstad is the chairman of the Board.  Our chief executive officer is employed by Granite Falls Energy and is provided on a part-time basis to the Company pursuant to our management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy.
Separation of the two offices is not mandated by the Company's Operating Agreement or our corporate governance guidelines and policies. However, we have determined the current separation of the two roles allow our chief executive officer to manage our day-to-day operations while allowing our chairman to focus on leading our Board in its duty to act in our best interests and that of the members. We believe this leadership structure allows our Board to best focus on its oversight role, providing us a perspective that is independent from that of our management and creating create checks and balances on the executive officers of the Company. 
Our Board reserves the right to determine the appropriate leadership structure from time to time.
Board's Role In Risk Oversight
Although management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks to the Company, our full Board is actively involved in providing broad oversight of the Company's risk management programs.  In this oversight role, our Board is responsible for satisfying itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by the Company's management are functioning and that the systems and processes in place will bring to its attention the material risks facing the Company in order to permit the Board to effectively oversee the management of these risks. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the  risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of our full board in the risk oversight process allows our Board to assess management's appetite for risk and also determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. Our Board regularly includes agenda items at its meetings relating to its risk oversight role and meets with various members of management on a range of topics, including commodity price risk management, corporate governance and regulatory obligations, operations and significant transactions, business continuity planning, succession planning, risk management, insurance, pending and threatened litigation and significant commercial disputes.
While our Board provides broad oversight of the Company's risk management processes, various committees of the Board oversee risk management in their respective areas and regularly report on their activities to our Board.  Principally, the risk management committee assists our Board in identifying and quantifying methods of mitigating or eliminating risk, principally those relating to commodity prices. Our audit committee focuses on assessing and mitigating financial risk, including internal controls over financial reporting. Our three-member executive board, functioning as our Compensation Committee, oversees risks and relevant risk controls related to the Company's compensation policies, programs and procedures, including the incentives they create, to encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with the Company's business strategy.
We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company and that our Board leadership structure provides appropriate checks and balances against undue risk taking.
Governors
Our current Board consists of nine governors, including five appointed governors and four elected governors.  Under our current Operating Agreement, the governors' terms are staggered such that three governors are up for election every year.  Nominees for governor are nominated by our Board, following consideration by our Board's nominating committee, and then elected by our members.  
Under Section 5.3(a)(iv) of the Operating Agreement, any member who, together with such member's affiliates, holds 9% or more of the units outstanding is entitled to appoint one governor to the Board for every 9% of units held, up to the right to appoint a maximum of four governors by any member who, together with such member's affiliates, holds 36% or more of the units outstanding but less than a majority of the units outstanding. No member who, together with such member's affiliates, holds 45% or more of the units outstanding but less than a majority of the units outstanding is entitled to appoint a majority of the governors to the Board, notwithstanding the fact that such member together with such member's affiliates owns 45% or more but less than a majority of the units outstanding. Any member who, together with such member's affiliates, holds a majority of the units outstanding is entitled to appoint a majority of the governors (five governors) to the Board.  An appointed governor serves indefinitely at the pleasure of the member appointing him or her (so long as such member and its affiliates continue to hold a sufficient number of units to maintain the applicable appointment right) until a successor is appointed, or until the earlier death, resignation or removal of the appointed governor.
Project Viking, a wholly owned subsidiary of Granite Falls Energy, is the only member entitled to appoint governors under Section 5.3(a)(iv) of our Operating Agreement. Granite Falls Energy directly owns 54,875 units and indirectly, through Project Viking, controls 39,420,949 units, for aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 50.7% of our issued and outstanding units.  Accordingly, Granite Falls Energy (through Project Viking) has the right to appoint a majority of the Company's Board and has appointed the following five governors: Paul Enstad, Rodney Wilkison, Dean Buesing, Marten Goulet, and Leslie Bergquist. 
In addition to our appointed and elected governors, our Board includes three alternate governors.  Two of these alternates serve as available replacements to the appointed governors and are designated by Granite Falls Energy.  One of the alternate governors serves as an available replacement to the elected governors and is designated by the elected governors of the Board.  The alternate governors are entitled to attend and participate in all meeting of the Board, but are only entitled to vote at a Board meeting at which an appointed governor or elected governor for which the alternate is serving is absent.  The alternates to the appointed governors designated by Granite Falls Energy (through Project Viking) are Kenton Johnson and Bruce LaVigne.  The alternate to the elected governors selected by the elected governors was Milton McKeown, until Mr. McKeown passed away in June 2018. Thereafter, the elected governors selected Jeremy Janssen as the alternate to the elected governors. The chart below lists the governors whose terms continue after the 2019 annual meeting and the incumbent governor nominee whose term expires at the 2019 annual meeting.  The address for all governors is 91246 390th Avenue, Heron Lake, Minnesota 56137.

Board of Managers of Agrinatural Gas, LLC
The Company owns a 73% controlling interest in Agrinatural Gas, LLC ("Agrinatural"), through our wholly-owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline Company, LLC. Rural Energy Solutions, LLC ("RES") owns the remaining 27% non-controlling interest in Agrinatural.

Agrinatural is governed by a seven-member board of managers.  Under Agrinatural's operating agreement, the Company has the right to appoint 4 of the 7 managers and Rural Energy Solutions, LLC has the right to appoint 3 managers.  The Company's appointed managers are elected annually by the Company's Board.  The Company selected Brian Kletscher,  Scott Dubbelde,  Robert Schlenner, and Sheila Helland, each of whose biographical information is provided below, to represent the Company's investment interest as a manager of Agrinatural.  Each of the below appointees were selected based upon their business and agriculture experience, as well as their independence from the Company.
Brian Kletscher, Age 57.  Mr. Kletscher was elected by the Board to serve as one of our appointed managers to the Agrinatural board of managers on April 20, 2017. Since November 6, 2008, Mr. Kletscher has been employed as the chief executive officer of Highwater Ethanol, LLC, an SEC-registered public reporting company.

Governor Independence Standards
Our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or in an inter-dealer quotation system that requires that a majority of the Board be independent. However, we use the independence standards set forth by the SEC and NASDAQ to evaluate the independence of our Board. 
In determining independence, the Board reviews whether governors have any material relationship with the Company taking into consideration the following factors: (i) the business relationships of our directors; (ii) positions our directors hold with other companies; (iii) family relationships between our directors and other individuals involved with the Company; (iv) transactions between our directors and the Company; and (v) compensation arrangements between our directors and the Company. An independent governor must not have any material relationship with the Company, directly or indirectly as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company, or any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a governor.
The Board undertook a review of governor independence in February 2019 as to all of the governors then serving.   As a result of its review, the Board affirmatively determined that Messrs. Woestehoff and McKeown are independent according to the "independence" definition of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.  Mssr. Janssen was not reviewed, as he was not a governor as of such date.    
Messrs. Enstad, Wilkison, Goulet, Bergquist, and Buesing are appointed to our Board by Granite Falls Energy. Additionally, Granite Falls Energy has appointed Messrs. Johnson and LaVigne as its alternate appointed governors available to serve in the absence of any of the appointed governors.  Granite Falls Energy has voting and disposition control over approximately 50.7% of the Company's units.  However, per SEC Rule 10A-3(e)(1)(ii)(B), ownership of 10% of an issuer's securities does not create a presumption of affiliation and thus lack of independence and, based upon all other factors, the Board made the determination that each of Messrs. Enstad, Wilkison, Goulet, Bergquist, Buesing, Johnson, and La Vigne was independent. 
The Board made the determination that each of Messrs. Ferguson, Kunerth, and Schmitz are not "independent" because they sold a significant amount of grain to us in fiscal year 2018 as discussed above under the section titled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."
Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted a code of ethics that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with the law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications.  The code of ethics applies to all of our employees, officers, and governors, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and risk manager.  The code of ethics is available free of charge on written request to Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC, 91246 390th Avenue, Heron Lake, Minnesota 56137.
Committees of Our Board of Governors
During fiscal year 2018, our Board had four standing committees: the audit committee, compensation committee, nomination and governance committee, and risk management committee.
Audit Committee
The audit committee's function is one of oversight and, in that regard, the audit committee meets with our management and independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss our financial reporting and our controls respecting accounting. The audit committee consists of Messrs. Rodney Wilkison (Chairman), Leslie Bergquist, and Michael Kunerth.  Marten Goulet also serves as an alternate member of the audit committee. Compensation Committee
The Board's three-member non-employee executive committee serves as our compensation committee. The executive board is responsible for discharging the Board's responsibilities relating to compensation of our Company's executive officers. The executive board has the authority to approve and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the compensation of the chief executive officer of the Company and evaluates the chief executive officer's performance in light of his goals and objectives, as determined by the executive board. The executive board consults with the chief executive officer with respect to compensation for the Company's other executives and the chief executive officer may be present at meetings for deliberations on non-CEO executive officer compensation, but he may not vote. The executive board consists of Messrs. Paul Enstad (Chairman), Rodney Wilkison, and Michael Kunerth.
Nominating Committee
The nominating committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become governors and recommending to the Board the nominees to be considered for election by members and for election by the Board to fill any vacancy or newly created governorship. The nominating committee consists of Messrs. David Woestehoff,  Doug Schmitz, Michael Kunerth, Steve Christensen,  and Lee Uldbjerg (Chairman).
Risk Management Committee
The risk management committee's function is to assist the Board in assessing and managing the risks associated with managing our processing margin and the purchase and sale of commodities required in connection with or produced as a result of our production of ethanol. The risk management committee consists of Steve Christensen, our chief executive officer, and Eric Baukol, our risk manager.
Board and Committee Meetings and Governor Attendance
The Board generally meets once per month.  The Board held twelve regularly scheduled and special meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  In addition, the audit committee held four meetings, the compensation committee held one meeting, the risk management committee held twelve meetings and the nominating committee held two meetings.  Each governor attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and Board committees on which such governor served during fiscal year 2018.    
As provided in the Operating Agreement, the alternate appointed and elected governors attend meetings of the Board.  If any elected governor is not available for, or during any part of, a meeting of the Board or to take action in writing in lieu of such a meeting, the alternate elected governor is entitled to act in the stead of such elected governor at such meeting, or during such part, or to take such action in writing (but only on behalf of one elected governor, if more than one is unavailable).  If any appointed governor is not available for, or during any part of, a meeting of the Board or to take action in writing in lieu of such a meeting, the alternate appointed governors are entitled to act in the stead of such appointed governors at such meeting, or during such part, or to take such action in writing (but only on behalf of two appointed governors, if more than two are unavailable).  Each alternate governor attended 75% or more of the Board meetings.  During fiscal year 2018,  Kenton Johnson participated as a voting governor in one meeting due to the absence of appointed governors.
The Board does not have a policy with regard to governors' attendance at annual meetings.  Last year all but one of our alternate governors attended the Company's annual meeting.  Due to this high attendance record, it is the view of the Board that such a policy is unnecessary.
Member Communications with Our Directors
The Board does not have a formalized process for holders of membership units to send communications to the Board.  The Board feels this is reasonable given the accessibility of our governors.  Members desiring to communicate with the Board are free to do so by contacting a governor via our website, fax, phone, or in writing to the Company's principal office at 91246 390th Avenue, Heron Lake, Minnesota 56137.  The Company will provide a copy of each such writing to the directed governor or to all governors if directed to the Board generally.  The names of our governors are set forth above and are listed on the Company's website at www.heronlakebioenergy.com in the "Board of Governors" section.
Audit Committee
The audit committee of the Board operates under a charter adopted by the Board.  Our audit committee charter is available on our website at www.heronlakebioenergy.com in the "Board of Governors" section. Under the charter, the audit committee must have at least three members.  The audit committee consists of three governors: Messrs. Michael S. Kunerth, Rodney Wilkison (chair),  Leslie Bergquist, and alternate Marten Goulet.  
During fiscal year 2018, the audit committee met four times. Each of our audit committee members and the alternate member attended all of the audit committee meetings, with the exception of one governor, Mr. Bergquist, who was not present for one audit committee meeting. 
The audit committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility for: (1) the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process and our systems of internal accounting and financial controls; (2) the performance of our internal audit function; (3) the annual independent integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting; and (4) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including our disclosure controls and procedures. The duties and responsibilities of the audit committee include the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm and the evaluation of our accounting firm's qualifications, independence, and performance.
The audit committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  However, our audit committee charter requires a majority of our committee members to be independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, as adopted in the Company's Governance Guidelines. A majority of the members of our audit committee are independent under the definition provided in our audit committee charter and the definition of independence provided by NASDAQ rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2).  Mr. Kunerth is not "independent" because he sold a significant amount of grain to us in fiscal year 2018 as discussed above under the section titled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION; Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions".  
All members of the committee must have a basic understanding of finance and accounting and be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, and at least one member of the committee must have accounting or related financial management expertise. The Board determined that the membership of the audit committee meets the requirements of its charter. 
Additionally, each year the Board reviews the qualifications of each member of the audit committee for the purpose of determining whether any governor serving on the audit committee would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under the rules of the SEC.  Based upon that review, the Board determined that Mr. Wilkison qualifies as an audit committee financial expert for fiscal year 2018.  Mr. Wilkison's experience as the owner and chief executive officer of Wilkison Consulting Service, which provides financial consulting, tax preparation, and monthly accounting services for farmers and small businesses, qualifies him to be the Audit Committee's financial expert.
Audit Committee Report
The following is a report of the audit committee for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The following report of the audit committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the report by reference in any such document.
The audit committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process.  The Company's independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles.  
The audit committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  
The audit committee has discussed with Boulay PLLP, its independent auditors, the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committee (AS16). The audit committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter to management from Boulay PLLP, as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and has discussed with the independent accountants the independent accountants' independence as required by the PCAOB and the Independence Rule 3526, Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence.  The audit committee has considered whether the provision of services by Boulay PLLP, not related to the audit of the financial statements referred to above and to the reviews of the interim consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q, are compatible with maintaining Boulay PLLP's independence and concluded that the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining Boulay PLLP's independence
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  
Submitted By the Audit Committee of the Board of Governors:
Rodney Wilkison, ChairMichael S. KunerthLeslie BergquistMarten Goulet (alternate)
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit committee selected Boulay PLLP, as independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year November 1, 2018 to October 31, 2019.  A representative of Boulay PLLP, is expected to be present at the 2019 annual meeting of members and will have an opportunity to make a statement if so desired.

            2017         $  18,000  				 
[END TABLE]
(1)The audit fees were incurred for the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements included within Form 10-K and review of the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as services in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017.
(2)The tax fees were billed for services rendered for tax compliance. The nature of the services comprising the tax fees was for year-end tax preparation of the partnership return and associated K-1's.
(3)The other fees were billed for services rendered for the Renewable Identification Number agreed-upon procedures as well as other financial, tax, and operational related consulting.
Prior to engagement of the principal independent registered public accountants to perform audit services for the Company, the principal accountant was pre-approved by our audit committee pursuant to Company policy requiring such approval.
One hundred percent (100%) of all audit services, audit-related services and tax-related services were pre-approved by our audit committee.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies
We have adopted pre-approval policies and procedures for the audit committee that require the audit committee to pre-approve all audit and all permitted non-audit engagements and services (including the fees and terms thereof) by the independent auditors, except that the audit committee may delegate the authority to pre-approve any engagement or service less than $10,000 to one of its members, but requires that the member report such pre-approval at the next full audit committee meeting. The audit committee may not delegate its pre-approval authority for any services rendered by our independent auditors relating to internal controls. These pre-approval policies and procedures prohibit delegation of the audit committee's responsibilities to our management. Under the policies and procedures, the audit committee may pre-approve specifically described categories of services which are expected to be conducted over the subsequent twelve months on its own volition, or upon application by management or the independent auditor.
All of the services described above for fiscal year 2018 were pre-approved by the audit committee or a member of the committee before Boulay PLLP was engaged to render the services. Nomination And Governance Committee
The nomination and governance committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board. Our nomination and governance committee charter is available on our website at www.heronlakebioenergy.com in the "Board of Governors" section. Under the charter, the nominating committee must consist of at least four members and may not have more than one member who is not a governor of the Company.    Messrs. David Woestehoff,  Michael Kunerth, Doug Schmitz, Steve Christensen, and Lee Uldbjerg currently serve as the Company's nominating committee. The chairperson of the nominating committee is Mr. Uldbjerg, who  is the principal of Uldbjerg Consulting LLC, a third-party consultant of the Company.
The Nominating Committee Charter provides that the Nominating Committee will (1) identifying and nominating individuals qualified to serve as governors and on committees of the Board; (2) advising the governors with respect to the Board's composition, procedures and committees; (3) developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles; and (4) overseeing the evaluation of the Board and the Board committees.  
The nomination and governance committee is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  Nevertheless, the committee's charter requires at least one of our committee members to be independent.  The Board has determined that Messrs. Woestehoff and Uldbjerg are independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  Messrs. Schmitz and Kunerth are not "independent" because they each sold a significant amount of grain to us in fiscal year 2018 as discussed above under the section titled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION; Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions".    
The nominating committee has the authority to engage consultants, and during fiscal year 2018 engaged Uldbjerg Consulting LLC to help identify and evaluate potential governor nominees. As part of the engagement, Uldbjerg Consulting LLC agreed to provide the services of Mr. Uldbjerg as the nomination and governance committee chair and that he would attend all meetings of the Company's nomination and governance committee and attend Board meetings as requested by our Board. In exchange for these services, we agreed to pay Uldbjerg Consulting LLC $250 per each nominating meeting attended by Mr. Uldbjerg plus travel expenses and mileage at IRS approved rates. For fiscal year 2018, we paid Uldbjerg Consulting LLC a total of approximately $285 and additional approximately $290 subsequent to the end of the 2018 fiscal year for his services on our nominating committee. The nomination and governance committee held two meetings in order to nominate candidates for the 2019 annual meeting and all members of the nomination and governance committee attended at least 75% of these meetings.
Process and Criteria for Identifying and Evaluating Nominees
The nomination and governance committee believes that having governors with relevant experience in business and industry, government, finance, and other areas is beneficial to our Board.  Governors with such backgrounds provide a useful perspective on significant risks and competitive advantages and an understanding of the challenges the Company faces.
The nomination and governance committee may seek input from other Board members or senior management in identifying candidates. The nomination and governance committee will consider candidates for Board membership suggested by members, provided that member nominations for directors must be made in accordance with our Operating Agreement (see the section below entitled "Member Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting").  All nominations must be submitted in writing along with a completed nominee questionnaire which includes the nominating member's name and contact information, a brief description of the candidate's business experience, civic involvement, education and such other information as the member submitting the recommendation believes is relevant to the evaluation of the candidate. We did not receive any member nominations for director for the 2019 annual meeting.
The nomination and governance committee evaluates candidates by reviewing the candidates' biographical information and qualifications,  checking the candidates' references and interviews with candidates. Prospective nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or any other basis proscribed by law. 
With respect to nominating existing directors, the nomination and governance committee reviews relevant information available to it, including the latest Board evaluations for such persons, if any, and assesses their continued ability and willingness to serve as a director.  The nomination and governance committee also assesses such persons' contributions in light of the mix of skills and experience the nominating committee deems appropriate for our Board.  
With respect to nominations of new governors, the nomination and governance committee will conduct a thorough search to identify candidates based upon criteria the nomination and governance committee deems appropriate and considering the mix of skills and experience necessary to complement existing Board members. The committee has not adopted minimum qualifications that nominees must meet in order for the committee to recommend them to the Board, as the committee believes that each nominee should be evaluated based on his or her merits as an individual, taking into account our needs and the needs of the Board. The nomination and governance committee evaluates each prospective nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in our governance guidelines, including but not limited to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Background, including demonstrated high personal and professional ethics and integrity; and the ability to exercise good business judgment and enhance the Board's ability to manage and direct the affairs and business of the Company; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Commitment, including the willingness to devote adequate time to the work of the Board and its committees, and the ability to represent the interests of all members and not a particular interest group; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Board skills needs, in the context of the existing makeup of the Board, and the candidate' s qualification as independent and qualification to serve on Board committees; 
· Diversity, in terms of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and other demographics which contribute to the Board's diversity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Business experience, which should reflect a broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government and/or education; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Such other relevant factors, as it deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
The nominating committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all directors or prospective nominees.
Compensation Committee
The compensation committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board. Our compensation committee charter is available on our website at www.heronlakebioenergy.com in the "Board of Governors" section.    The Board has not established a committee specifically entitled "compensation committee." Rather, the executive board serves as the Company's compensation committee and reports all of its activities as the "compensation committee" to the full Board.  The executive board operates under the compensation committee charter when performing its functions as a compensation committee.  The executive board carried out its function as a compensation committee during two meetings held in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
Our executive board performs the same tasks usually performed by a compensation committee overseeing our compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including any executive compensation plans, governor compensation plans and incentive compensation and equity-based plans. 
The executive board is exempt from independence listing standards because our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  However, the charter of the compensation committee requires majority of members of the compensation committee must satisfy the independence requirements of: (1) the NASDAQ Listing Rules, as adopted in the Company's Governance Guidelines; (2) Section 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, if Section 16 is applicable to the Company; and (3) Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, all as amended from time to time. The Board has determined that Messrs. Enstad and Wilkison are independent under the NASDAQ definition of independence.  Mr. Kunerth is not "independent" because he sold a significant amount of grain to us in fiscal year 2018 as discussed above under the section titled "SECTION III - REQUIRED INFORMATION; Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions".     
For additional information on the responsibilities and activities of the executive board, including the process for determining executive compensation, see the sections of this proxy statement entitled "Governor Compensation" and "Compensation Of Executive Officers."
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of the executive board is or has been an employee of the Company.  There are no interlocking relationships between our Company and other entities that might affect the determination of the compensation of our executive officers. GOVERNOR COMPENSATION
We do not provide our governors with any equity or equity option awards, nor any non-equity incentive payments or deferred compensation.  Similarly, we do not provide our governors with any other perquisites, "gross-ups," defined contribution plans, consulting fees, life insurance premium payments or otherwise. 
Our governor compensation policy was approved by our Board in September 2013.  The current governor compensation policy provides that each governor receives a monthly stipend of $1,000 per Board meeting attended in-person plus an additional $250 per Board meeting for meeting participation whether attended in person or by conference call.  Additionally, we also pay $250 for additional meetings of greater than one-half day in length; $125 for attending meetings less than one-half day in length; and $125 for attendance at meetings by conference call.  The following amounts are also paid to governors for specified services: (i) the Chairman and Secretary of the Board are paid $500 per month, and (ii) members of the audit committee are paid $1,000 per quarter.
The following table sets forth all compensation paid or payable by the Company to our governors during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.  As of February 28, 2019, none of our officers had any options, warrants, or other similar rights to purchase securities of the Company.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Throughout this proxy statement, the individuals who serve as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are referred to as the "executive officers".  Pursuant to our management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy, these executive officers are employed by Granite Falls Energy and provide part-time management services to our Company.  Subject to the terms of the management services agreement discussed below, Granite Falls Energy sets the compensation paid to the executive officers that are employees of Granite Falls Energy.
Compensation Committee
Our three-member executive board serves as the Company's compensation committee for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, reporting all compensation committee activities for review by the full Board.  Subject to oversight by the full Board, the executive board has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.  
The executive board ensures that the total compensation paid to management and employees is fair, reasonable and competitive. The compensation committee considers compensation paid to all Company employees, subject to the terms of the management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy, as described above in the section titled section "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions".

[END TABLE]
 Compensation Committee Procedures
The executive board, acting as the compensation committee, is responsible for determining the nature and amount of compensation for the Company's management employees. The compensation committee receives input from the chief executive officer on the personal performance achievements of the management employees who report to him. This individual performance assessment determines a portion of the annual compensation for each manager. In addition, the chief executive officer provides input on salary increases, incentive compensation opportunities, and long-term incentive grants for the management employees who report to him, which the committee considers when making executive compensation decisions. The executive board also may solicit input from our human resources personnel, primarily relating to benefit programs and local labor market conditions.  
In addition, the Board annually reviews the executive officers' performance pursuant to the management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy.  A part of this review includes decisions and approvals regarding compensation reimbursement by the Company to Granite Falls Energy.
Compensation Elements
The executive board followed the guiding principles outlined above in the development and administration of compensation programs for our management. Compensation programs for our named executive officers were determined by Granite Falls Energy as provided in our management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy.  During fiscal year 2018, the components of our management compensation programs consisted of base salary and incentive cash bonuses, perquisites and other personal benefits. Additionally, management (other than our executive officers) was also eligible to participate in the same benefit programs as were available to our other employees.
For fiscal year 2018, the principal components of the compensation for executive officers included: 
Base Salaries
Base salaries for management and other employees employed by the Company are established based on the scope of their roles, responsibilities, experience levels and performance, and taking into account competitive market compensation paid by comparable companies for similar positions. Base salaries are reviewed approximately annually, and may be adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual performance and experience.  
The base salaries of our executive officers are set by Granite Falls Energy as provided in the management services agreement. The Company's obligation to reimburse Granite Falls Energy for the base salaries paid to these shared employees is established by the management services agreement.
Bonus
In addition to the base salaries, management and other employees employed by the Company may receive bonuses. The bonuses, if any, of the executive officers are set by Granite Falls Energy. The Company's obligation to reimburse Granite Falls Energy for bonuses paid to these shared employees is established by the management services agreement.
Our executive officers and management employees may receive bonuses in the discretion of our Board. The Company did not award any discretionary bonuses during fiscal 2018.
Benefits and Perquisites
We do not provide any material executive perquisites. We have no supplemental retirement plans or pension plans.
Accounting and Tax Treatment of Awards
None of our executive officers, governors, or employees receives compensation in excess of $1,000,000 and therefore the entire amount of their compensation is deductible by the Company as a business expense. Certain large executive compensation awards are not tax deductible by companies making such awards. None of our compensation arrangements are likely to reach this cap in the foreseeable future. Report of the Compensation Committee
The following report of the compensation committee shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference in such filing.
The executive board has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.  Based upon this review and discussion, the Board determined that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be included in this proxy statement.
Submitted By the Compensation Committee of the Board of Governors:

[END TABLE]
 (5)The Company paid Granite Falls Energy, in the aggregate, approximately $449,000, $416,000, and $375,000, during each of fiscal years 2018,  2017, and 2016, respectively, for services provided pursuant the management services agreement, which included Mr. Christensen's and Ms. Schuler's services, and the services of a shared risk manager. 
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Steve Christensen, our Chief Executive Officer.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO) was $76,225; and 
· The annual total compensation of our CEO was $149,408 (see note 4 below). 
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 1.96 to 1.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.      We determined that, as of October 31, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year, our employee population consisted of approximately 42 individuals, with all of these individuals located in the United States. We made no cost of living adjustments. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.      To identify the median employee from our employee population, we used the amount of cash compensation in the form of gross salaries and wages paid to our employees as our consistently applied compensation measure. We also annualized, as permitted, the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of fiscal year 2018. We selected total cash compensation for all employees because it is readily available and consistently calculated for each employee, so we believe it is the most appropriate and representative measure of compensation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    3.      With respect to the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for the entire 2018 fiscal year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in total compensation of $76,225.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    4.      With respect to the CEO, we used the amount reported as total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement, plus the cost of one-half of the CEO's health benefits. (Refer to the discussion in the section above titled "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions" for an explanation of the one-half allocation.)    This resulted in annual total compensation for purposes of determining the ratio in the amount of $149,408, which exceeds the amount reported for him in the Summary Compensation Table by $6,789. 
[END TABLE]
