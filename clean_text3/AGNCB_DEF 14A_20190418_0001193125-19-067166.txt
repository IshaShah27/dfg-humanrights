AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. AT A GLANCE 
AGNC Investment Corp. ("AGNC," the "Company," "we," "our," and "us") is an internally-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") that invests primarily in residential mortgage-backed securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored entity ("GSE") or a U.S. Government agency (referred to as "Agency" securities). We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related residential and commercial mortgage-based securities where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or other U.S. Government agency or in other investments in, or related to, the housing, mortgage, or real estate markets. AGNC is a private source of capital supporting the U.S. housing market. AGNC's internal management structure, Agency MBS investment focus, and scale are significant differentiators relative to other potential comparative public companies.

AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. AT A GLANCE 
Industry-Leading Performance 
AGNC combines a track-record of strong financial performance with the lowest operating cost structure in the residential mortgage REIT industry. We have generated strong returns since our initial public offering ("IPO"), outperforming residential mortgage REIT peers and the broader market. 
Since our May 2008 IPO through December 31, 2018, AGNC has declared $39.32 in cumulative dividends per common share, or a total of $8.5 billion in dividends paid to our stockholders and has generated a total stock return of 345%, compared to 85% for our Agency-focused residential mortgage REIT peers (collectively, the "Agency REIT Peer Group"), 105% for the residential-focused mortgage REIT universe (collectively, the "Resi mREIT Universe"), and 124% for the S&P 500. While AGNC generated an economic return of -4.9% for fiscal year 2018, we exceeded the Agency REIT Peer Group economic return of -8.5% by 3.6%, and produced a total stock return of -2.5%, compared to -13.4% for the Agency REIT Peer Group, -3.9% for the Resi mREIT Universe, and -4.4% for the S&P 500. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Stock return is measured from AGNC's IPO through December 31, 2018. Total stock return over a period  includes price appreciation and dividend reinvestment; dividends are assumed to be reinvested at the closing price of the security on the ex-dividend date. Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence.   
(2)  The residential mortgage REIT ("mREIT") universe is unweighted and includes Great Ajax Corp.  ("AJX"), Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation ("ANH"), ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. ("ARR"), Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation ("CHMI"), Chimera Investment Corporation ("CIM"), Capstead  Mortgage Corporation ("CMO"), Dynex Capital, Inc. ("DX"), Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT ("EARN"), Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. ("IVR"), MFA Financial, Inc. ("MFA"), AG Mortgage Investment  Trust, Inc. ("MITT"), Annaly Capital Management, Inc. ("NLY"), New Residential Investment Corp. ("NRZ"), New York Mortgage Trust, Inc. ("NYMT"), Orchid Island Capital, Inc. ("ORC"), PennyMac Mortgage  Investment Trust ("PMT"), Redwood Trust, Inc. ("RWT"), Two Harbors Investment Corp. ("TWO"), and Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corporation ("WMC") (collectively, the "Resi mREIT Universe"). For  Agency-focused residential mortgage REIT peer comparison purposes, AGNC's peer group is unweighted and includes ANH, ARR, CMO, and NLY (collectively, the "Agency REIT Peer Group"). For purposes of evaluating our 2018 performance, CYS  Investments, Inc., which was acquired in July 2018, is included in the Agency REIT Peer Group on a prorated basis.  
[END TABLE]
Qualified Leadership 
The AGNC management team is led by Gary Kain, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, and includes a broad mix of mortgage investment experts and industry thought leaders. This management team has a strong track record of success, as reflected in our outperformance since our IPO. 
ii    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. AT A GLANCE 
 Additionally, we recognize the importance of strong independent leadership on our Board of Directors (the "Board") and believe that separating the positions of Chair and CEO is the best corporate governance leadership structure for us at this time. Prue Larocca, an independent director, serves as our Board Chair. 
AGNC's Board is currently comprised of six members, including five independent directors, whose diverse range of experience and backgrounds makes them highly qualified to oversee our strategy, operations, and risk management. We evaluate our Board's backgrounds, skill sets, experience, and diversity on an ongoing basis, including as part of our annual evaluation process, to ensure they align with the Company's go-forward strategy. We expanded the size of our Board with the appointment of Donna Blank as an independent director on December 3, 2018.

Strong Stockholder Focus 
Our internal management structure provides us a differentiated platform that is closely aligned with stockholder interests. We stand out among mortgage REITs for our transparency, focus on financial disclosure, and our high-quality governance and compensation practices. 
Stockholder Engagement 
Consistent with our focus on and commitment to our stockholders, we actively engage with and value the opinions of our stockholders, which have influenced the continuing evolution of our compensation program and corporate governance practices. Following our 2018 annual meeting, we conducted extensive stockholder engagement, including meetings that included our independent Board chair as well as the chair of our Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Compensation Committee"). Our Board was particularly focused on investor feedback regarding our executive compensation program in light of the low support for our 2018 advisory resolution on executive compensation. 
In the fall of 2018, we sought meetings with institutional stockholders holding 80% of our institutionally-held common stock and comprising 53% of our outstanding common stock. We ultimately had conversations with investors holding 48% of the institutionally-held common stock and 32% of our total outstanding common stock, in addition to meeting with proxy advisory firms. We engaged with our retail investors, who own 34% of our outstanding common stock, at their request and through our proxy solicitation efforts.

AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. AT A GLANCE 
Executive Compensation Program Overview and Evolution 
Philosophy and Structure 
In connection with the internalization of our management (the "Internalization") in July 2016, the result of the acquisition of the parent of our external manager from American Capital, Ltd. ("American Capital"), our Compensation Committee implemented a compensation program that aligns executive compensation to our financial and strategic objectives, is highly incentive-based, fully transparent, and reduces operating expenses through elimination of management fees. 
We believe that it is important to maintain an appropriate and competitive compensation program that drives our key employees both in the short- and long-term and aligns the interests of our executive officers and other employees with those of our stockholders. We do not benchmark our compensation levels against comparator companies as we believe that our internal management structure combined with our size and scale relative to other mortgage REITs significantly differentiates us. 
We compensate our named executive officers ("NEOs") in a manner that balances short- and long-term compensation and cash and equity-based compensation. Our NEOs' compensation program includes three primary elements: base salary, short-term incentives in the form of an annual cash bonus, and long-term equity incentives in the form of performance-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") and time-based RSUs. Since our Internalization, the composition of our NEOs' total target compensation has shifted significantly, with a greater emphasis on performance-based compensation and long-term equity. In 2018, 81% of average target compensation of our NEOs consisted of short-term and long-term incentive compensation, a 5% increase from 77% in 2017. In 2019, 85% of average NEO target compensation will be incentive based. 
CEO Compensation Changes and Program Enhancements 
During our stockholder engagement, a number of investors provided their view that a greater percentage of our CEO Gary Kain's compensation should be linked to long-term performance. As a result of this feedback, the Compensation Committee and Mr. Kain engaged in discussions to amend his employment contract in a way that would significantly shift his target compensation from annual cash payments to long-term performance-based incentives. Thus, beginning on February 1, 2019, $2.7 million of Mr. Kain's target compensation was reallocated from cash, in the form of salary and annual bonus, to performance-based long-term incentive awards. As a result of this shift, 56% of Mr. Kain's total compensation at target will consist of long-term equity incentive awards, 67% of which will be performance-based. The details of Mr. Kain's revised compensation are discussed further on page 48 of this proxy statement. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee revised the corporate scorecard for determining incentive compensation under our short-term program for 2019. These changes are in addition to the revisions made to the 2018 scorecard increasing the weighting of financial measures and adjusting certain performance metrics. The 2019 revised scorecard is simplified and provides for increased rigor of the performance metrics relative to 2018. We also enhanced the disclosure around the process the Committee undertakes when setting metrics and goals. For a more detailed discussion of the 2019 scorecard, please see page 40.

Our Board is currently comprised of five independent directors and our CEO. The following table sets forth the current members of our Board and their committee membership:

[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Director is "independent" as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of The Nasdaq Listing Rules (the "Nasdaq  rules").  
(1)  Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined in Rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2) of  the Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Board has determined that Mr. Harvey and Ms. Blank are each an "audit  committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")).  
(2)  Each member of the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee is "independent" as defined in  Rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(d)(2) of the Nasdaq rules.  
(3)  It is anticipated that Ms. Blank will be appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee in 2019.   
[END TABLE]
Board Leadership Structure 
Ms. Larocca has served as our Chair and lead independent director since May 2016, and Mr. Kain has served as our Chief Executive Officer since March 2016. We recognize the importance of strong independent leadership on our Board and believe that separating the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer is the best corporate governance leadership structure for us at this time. Our Board has determined that all of the current directors, except Mr. Kain, are "independent" as defined in the Nasdaq rules. 
It is our Board's policy as a matter of good corporate governance to have our independent directors meet regularly without members of management or employee directors present to facilitate the Board's effective independent oversight of management. Presently, our independent directors meet during our Board's quarterly in-person meetings and may hold additional meetings at the request of the Chair or any other independent director. 
Each of our Board's Audit Committee and Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors. These independent committees of our Board also have the authority under their respective charters to hire independent advisors and consultants, at the Company's expense, to assist them in performing their duties. A majority of our Board's Executive Committee also consists of independent directors. 
Corporate Governance 
Our Board has developed strong corporate governance practices, which are memorialized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, to support its oversight responsibilities. These guidelines, together with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our "Certificate of Incorporation"), Third Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended (our "By-laws"), and committee charters of the Audit Committee and the Compensation, form the basis for performance of our governance activities. All of these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at www.AGNC.com.

BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee 
This committee's principal functions are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversee and review our compensation practices with respect to our executive officers, employees, and members of  the Board and make recommendations to the Board on these matters;  
• set the terms of employment of our executive officers and recommend CEO compensation decisions for approval by  all of the independent directors on our Board;  
• administer our equity and incentive plans to the extent delegated authority by the Board;  
• provide general oversight of our compensation structure, including any compensation plans;  
• regularly evaluate and report to the Board on executive and director succession plans;

• monitor and facilitate our governance, including membership of the Board and operations pursuant to our Corporate  Governance Guidelines;  
• review and evaluate the sufficiency of our Code of Ethics;  
• oversee evaluation of our Board, committees, and management; and  
• produce a report on executive compensation required to be included in our proxy statement for our annual  meetings.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also serves as the Board's standing nominating committee and as such performs the following functions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying, recruiting, and recommending to the Board qualified candidates for election as directors and  recommending a slate of nominees for election as directors by our common stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders;  
• developing and recommending to the Board Corporate Governance Guidelines, including the committee's  selection criteria for director nominees;  
• recommending to the Board nominees for each committee of the Board; and  
• annually facilitating an assessment of the Board's performance as a whole and of the individual directors  and making reports thereon to the Board.  
[END TABLE]
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select, retain, and terminate compensation consultants. In connection with the Internalization in 2016, the Compensation Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") to assist the Compensation Committee in designing and establishing a compensation structure. Since that time, the Compensation Committee has engaged FW Cook on an annual basis to advise on and assist with the review and evaluation of executive compensation and compensation of our non-employee directors. 
Board and Committee Meetings 
Under our By-laws and Delaware law, the Board and its committees are permitted to take actions at regular or special meetings and by written consent. The Board generally holds regular quarterly meetings and meets on other occasions as necessary. The Board held 11 regular and special meetings during 2018. In addition, the independent directors met separately in executive sessions to discuss various matters, including our performance and the performance of our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers. 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    3 
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Each of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee schedules regular meetings to coincide with the quarterly in-person meetings of the Board and also meets at the request of senior management or at such other times as its Chair determines. The Chair of each Committee, in consultation with our Secretary, sets the agendas for the meetings. Each committee reports to the Board on its activities at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting following its committee meetings and when appropriate. During 2018, the Audit Committee held five meetings, and the Compensation Committee held six meetings. 
Each of our independent directors attended all of the meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served in 2018. Mr. Kain was unable to attend one special meeting of the Board but attended all other meetings. Although we do not have a policy on director attendance at the Annual Meeting, directors are encouraged to attend, and each of our directors who was on the Board at that time attended the 2018 Annual Meeting in person. 
Director Nomination Process 
Nominations for election to the Board may be made by the Compensation Committee or by any common stockholder entitled to vote for the election of directors. Candidates recommended by common stockholders will be evaluated by the Compensation Committee under the same criteria that are applied to other candidates. 
Board Membership Criteria 
The Compensation Committee endeavors to identify, recruit, and nominate candidates based on the following eligibility and experience criteria: a candidate's integrity and business ethics, strength of character, judgment, experience, and independence, as well as factors relating to the composition of the Board, including its size and structure, the relative strengths and experience of current directors, and principles of diversity, including diversity of experience, personal and professional backgrounds, race, gender, and age. The Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of diverse viewpoints, experience, and backgrounds to a well-functioning Board. Although the committee does not have formal objective criteria for diversity on our Board, it is a significant consideration, and since 2013, 75% of new director nominations have been women or minority candidates. In nominating candidates to the Board, the committee determines whether the incumbent director is willing to stand for re-election. If so, the committee evaluates his or her contributions to determine suitability for continued service, taking into consideration the Board's criteria for candidates, the Board evaluation process, and other perceived needs of the Board. The Company maintains a corporate membership in the NACD, which provides each director with access to continuing education, research materials, and publications relating to corporate governance, board leadership, and other topical information. 
Oversight of Strategy and Key Risks 
Our Board is responsible for the general oversight of the Company, including our strategic direction, the performance of our executive officers, and the Company's risk management processes, to assure that the long-term interests of our stockholders are being served. In performing this oversight function, the Board, directly or through its standing committees, regularly reviews and discusses our corporate strategy and our material strategic, operational, financial, compensation, and compliance risks with senior management. 
4    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
The Board receives updates at each regular meeting on the Company's performance, market conditions, and other recent developments, including, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing us, as well as the strategies used to hedge the Company's exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, and extension risks. The Board periodically reviews and discusses with management and in executive session our near and longer run strategic direction. The Board has also adopted, and regularly reviews our compliance with, various policies and procedures addressing other operational risks. 
The Board believes the risk of cybersecurity is an enterprise-wide concern impacting people, processes, and operations, and in light of the pervasive and increasing threat from cyber attached to all companies, the Board believes oversight of this risk is appropriately allocated to the full Board. The Board has evaluated with management the threat to the Company after considering our operations and the types of data retained on our systems. Although our primary business involves investment in mortgages and mortgage-related instruments, we do not receive personal information on individual mortgage borrowers as part of our regular operations, as we do not perform mortgage servicing, maintain customer accounts, or provide any direct mortgage lending. The Company contracts with third party security firms to provide threat detection and conduct annual testing on our systems. The Board reviews cybersecurity and receives reports from the Company's Senior Vice President for Information Technology on an annual basis. The Board may also receive additional updates or reports from management as necessary. 
The Board also recognizes the importance of effective executive leadership to our successful execution of strategy and promotion of an ethical and professional culture throughout our organization. The Board is actively engaged in overseeing succession planning and our human capital management. The Board and the Compensation Committee routinely review staffing for critical roles, considering the operational needs of the Company and the potential leadership, industry knowledge, and investment skills of existing employees. The Board and Compensation Committee remain interested in the engagement of the Company's employees and discuss with senior management results of engagement surveys conducted with employees. Executives and other key employees in the Company are given exposure to the Board during meetings and other events to assist with their development and the Board's evaluation. In addition, the Board is regularly updated on management's strategies for recruiting, developing, and retaining outstanding personnel and minimizing employee turnover, as applicable. These strategies include the Company's broad-based long-term incentive compensation program which make grants of RSUs to all employees at every level of the Company, thereby further aligning the interest of all of our employees with our stockholders. 
The Board has delegated certain risk management oversight responsibility to its committees as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regulatory Compliance Risk: The Board, both directly and through the Audit  Committee, receives regular reports from the Company's legal, accounting, and internal audit representatives on regulatory matters, including the Company's compliance with its REIT qualification and exemption from the Investment Company  Act of 1940, compliance with our Code of Ethics, and our advisory subsidiary's compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial and Accounting Risk: The Audit Committee oversees the  Company's management of its financial, accounting, internal controls, and regulatory compliance through regular meetings with our Chief Financial Officer, senior representatives of the Company's accounting, tax, internal audit, and legal  departments, and representatives of the Company's independent public accountant.  
[END TABLE]

Corporate Responsibility 
We understand the importance of incorporating environmental and social considerations into our business and day-to-day operations. We consider the interests of all our stakeholders – our stockholders, employees, lenders and other counterparties, vendors, and community – in pursuing the long-term success of our business. 
Environmental Considerations 
As an investment firm with 56 office-based employees, our business operations have a relatively modest environmental impact. Nevertheless, we do consider environmental risk factors and strive to use resources efficiently and responsibly. 
Our corporate efforts to reduce our environmental impact include:

• Water coolers  
• Compostable and recycled kitchen products  
[END TABLE]
Social Considerations 
AGNC's primary social considerations and impacts relate to our investment activity and human capital management, both of which are critical to our success as an organization. 
Investment Activity 
As a provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market through our investments in residential mortgages, our business enhances liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitates home ownership in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, AGNC had over $90 billion in aggregate mortgage and mortgage-related investments. AGNC is also a substantial investor in "lower balance" and high loan-to-value ("LTV") loans, including those originated under the Home Affordable Refinance Program ("HARP"), both of which support mortgage types that have been historically disfavored by mortgage originators or investors. In aggregate, lower balance and high LTV loans, including HARP loans, constituted approximately 51%, or over $46 billion, of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018. 
Human Capital Management 
As an employer, we have a responsibility to our most important asset, our employees. We are committed to providing our employees an engaging, supportive, and inclusive atmosphere in which to grow professionally and contribute. We recognize the importance of ongoing communication and engagement with our employees through direct channels, facilitated by our small employee base. In addition, we provide a hotline where employees can submit claims or report suspected abuses anonymously. We recently completed an anonymous employee survey, and the Company had an over 90% satisfaction rating in many areas, including AGNC's treatment of its employees, physical working conditions, commitment to integrity, and overall culture and environment. Based on the results of this survey, our Board and management are working to implement a number of ideas and recommendations that we received from employees. 
We are also committed to promoting equality and further increasing diversity within our workforce. We were recently recognized as one of 230 companies selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for our commitment to transparency in gender reporting and advancing women's equality.

Director Compensation 
As described in more detail below, we compensate our independent directors with cash retainers and equity-based awards. Directors who are employees of the Company or our subsidiaries do not receive any compensation for service as a member of the Board although we reimburse all directors for travel expenses incurred in connection with Board and committee meetings and Board-related functions. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the form and amount of compensation paid to our independent directors to ensure it remains consistent with quality corporate governance practices. In these reviews, the Compensation Committee regularly consults with FW Cook for advice on the design and structure of the program, information on recent trends and developments in non-employee director compensation, general industry data, and analyses of the competitiveness of our non-employee director compensation levels relative to comparable companies. Based on its review, the Board has concluded that the compensation paid to the independent directors for service on the Board, including the retainers for Board and committee chair positions, is reasonable in light of the work required in each role. 
Independent directors receive a cash retainer for service on the Board at the rate of $100,000 per year, payable quarterly in advance. The Chairs of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee each receive an additional annual retainer of $25,000, each payable quarterly in advance. Our Chair receives an additional annual retainer of $50,000, payable quarterly in advance.

BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
The Board believes that a substantial portion of director compensation should consist of equity-based compensation to assist in aligning the long-term interests of our directors with those of our stockholders. On April 19, 2018, each of our independent directors serving on the Board at that time received 6,680 RSUs under the AGNC Investment Corp. 2016 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2016 Plan"), which is described in more detail below. The RSUs vest on April 19, 2019, subject to the director's continued service on our Board through the vesting date. Each RSU represents the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of our common stock, plus dividend equivalents, subject to the terms of the 2016 Plan. 
The following table sets forth the compensation received by each independent director during 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

(1)  The amounts reported in the "Stock Awards" column represent the grant date fair value of each award  granted calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ("ASC 718"), as required by Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations. Each award  represents the right to receive 6,680 shares of common stock (calculated by dividing the value of the award by the closing price of a share of common stock on the grant date, which was $18.71 on April 19, 2018). As of December 31, 2018, in  connection with these awards, each of Ms. Larocca, Dr. Davis, and Messrs. Harvey and Mullings had unvested RSUs relating to 7,287 shares of common stock, including dividend equivalents on the RSUs.  
(2)  Ms. Blank was appointed to the Board effective December 3, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The 2016 Plan 
The Company maintains the 2016 Plan, which allows us to provide our directors, executive officers, and other employees with equity incentive compensation. Subject to adjustment as described in the 2016 Plan, total awards under the 2016 Plan are limited to 10,000,000 shares, inclusive of dividend equivalents paid on such awards. These shares may be shares of original issuance or treasury shares or a combination of the two. Pursuant to the 2016 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash incentive awards, certain other awards based on or related to our common stock, and dividend equivalents paid with respect to awards under the 2016 Plan. Awards may be time-vested or performance-vested. 
The 2016 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents, and certain other awards denominated or payable in, or otherwise based on, shares of common stock, plus cash incentive awards, for the purpose of providing our non-employee directors, officers, and other employees, and those of our subsidiaries, incentives and rewards for service or performance. The 2016 Plan places a limit on the dollar value of awards and other compensation that may be made to a director in any year. The grant agreements for grants awarded under the 2016 Plan permit members of our Board to defer distribution of their awards for a period of up to ten years. 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    9 
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Independent Director Plan 
In connection with our IPO, we established the American Capital Agency Corp. Equity Incentive Plan for Independent Directors (the "Independent Director Plan"), which provided for the issuance of equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock awards, and other awards based on our common stock that may be made by us to our independent directors. The Independent Director Plan was terminated when our stockholders approved the 2016 Plan on December 9, 2016, except with respect to then outstanding awards. Restricted stock units awarded under the Independent Director Plan conferred to the participant the right to receive cash, common stock, or other property, as determined by the plan administrator, having a value equal to the number of shares of our common stock that were subject to the award. The holders of awards of restricted stock units were entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which in either case could be payable immediately or on a deferred basis and could elect to defer distribution of their equity-based awards for a period of up to ten years. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board believes that directors more effectively represent the best interests of the Company if they are stockholders themselves. Thus, independent directors are encouraged to own shares of our common stock equal in value to 3x the annual cash Board retainer (which is $100,000) within the later of five years of joining the Board or January 24, 2022. Shares of deferred or restricted stock or units (both vested and unvested and including shares for which a deferral election was made) granted to directors under the Independent Director Plan and the 2016 Plan are included in determining the number of shares held for this purpose. Until the stated minimum is met, each independent director must retain at least 50% of the shares of common stock received upon vesting, net of any shares withheld or sold to pay or reimburse taxes on such income. 
In addition, our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting our directors and executive officers from any hedging, pledging, or entering into margin loans with respect to any shares of our common stock (regardless of whether such stock is owned directly or indirectly, as such terms are used in the SEC rules promulgated under the Exchange Act) or from engaging in short sales of our common stock or otherwise entering into any other transaction or derivative agreement where he or she would earn a profit based on a decline of our stock price. 
The following table sets forth the total stock ownership of our independent directors, including beneficially owned, unvested, and deferred shares, as calculated pursuant to our stock ownership guidelines as of February 22, 2019:

Director Resignation Policy 
Our By-laws require a candidate in an uncontested election for director to receive a majority of the votes cast in order to be elected as a director. Under this provision, each vote is specifically counted "for" or "against" 
10    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
 the director's election, unless a common stockholder abstains from voting with respect to the matter. Thus, a director nominee is required to receive more votes "for" than "against" to be elected. Pursuant to Delaware law, a director shall remain in office until his or her successor is elected and qualified even if the director has not received a vote sufficient for re-election. Thus, a corporation could have a "holdover" director. However, pursuant to our Board-approved director resignation policy, an incumbent director must tender his or her resignation to the Board if the director is nominated but not re-elected. The policy also requires the Compensation Committee to make a recommendation to the full Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation within 90 days of receipt of the tendered resignation, and the full Board to make that determination. The Board would publicly disclose its decision by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC within four days of making its determination. 
Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this policy may not participate in the Compensation Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. If each member of the Compensation Committee does not receive a vote sufficient for re-election, then the independent directors who did receive a sufficient vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. If only three or fewer directors receive a sufficient vote for re-election, all directors (other than the director who tendered the resignation under review) may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers. 
Certain Transactions with Related Persons 
Related Person Transaction Policies 
Our Board has adopted a policy regarding the approval of any "related person transaction," which is any transaction or series of transactions in which we or any of our subsidiaries is or are to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a "related person" (as defined under SEC rules) has a direct or indirect material interest. Under the policy, a related person would need to promptly disclose to our Secretary any related person transaction and all material facts about the transaction. Our Secretary would then promptly assess and communicate that information to the Compensation Committee. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Compensation Committee will decide whether or not to approve such transaction and will generally approve only those transactions that do not create a conflict of interest. If we become aware of an existing related person transaction that has not been pre-approved under this policy, the transaction will be referred to the Compensation Committee, which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision, or termination of such transaction. Our policy requires any director who may be interested in a related person transaction to recuse himself or herself from any consideration of such related person transaction. 
Our Code of Ethics, which is reviewed by our Board and provided to all of our directors, officers, and employees, requires that all such persons avoid any situations or relationships that involve actual or potential conflicts of interest, or perceived conflicts of interest, between an individual's personal interests and the interests of AGNC. Pursuant to our Code of Ethics, each of these persons must disclose any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict, to their supervisor or our chief compliance officer. If a conflict is determined to exist, the person must disengage from the conflict situation or terminate his or her provision of services to us. Our chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, directors and certain other persons who may be designated by our Board or its Audit Committee, whom we collectively refer to as our financial executives, must consult with our chief compliance officer with respect to any proposed actions or arrangements that are not clearly consistent with our Code of Ethics. In the 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    11 
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
 event that a financial executive wishes to engage in a proposed action or arrangement that is not consistent with our Code of Ethics, the financial executive must obtain a waiver of the relevant provisions of our Code of Ethics in advance from our Audit Committee. We intend to post amendments to or waivers from the Code of Ethics (to the extent applicable to our financial executives) on our web site at www.AGNC.com. 
Related Person Transactions 
Following the Internalization, our subsidiary, MTGE Management, LLC served as the investment manager of MTGE Investment Corp. ("MTGE") until October 7, 2018 pursuant to a management agreement. In 2018, we received $10.8 million in management fees in addition to reimbursements of certain expenses from MTGE. Pursuant to the termination of the management agreement with MTGE, MTGE Management, LLC also received a termination fee of $41.7 million. Prior to the termination of the MTGE management agreement, certain officers of AGNC also served as officers of MTGE. In addition, Mr. Kain served on the Board of MTGE until May 2, 2018. None of our officers received any form of compensation from MTGE for their service as officers, and Mr. Kain received no separate compensation for his service as a director of MTGE. 
We have not entered into any other transactions in which any other related person of ours has any material interest. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 served as an officer, former officer, or employee of ours or had a relationship disclosable under "Board and Governance Matters—Certain Transactions with Related Persons." Further, during 2018, none of our executive officers served as:

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee presently composed of five directors, Mss. Blank and Larocca, Dr. Davis, and Messrs. Harvey and Mullings.

The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Blank and Mr. Harvey are each an "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act). 
The Audit Committee's responsibility is one of oversight as set forth in its charter, which is available in the Investors section of our website at www.AGNC.com.

The independent auditors are responsible for auditing the financial statements and for expressing an opinion as to whether those audited financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial statements with management and with Ernst & Young LLP, our independent auditors for 2018.

The Audit Committee has received from Ernst & Young LLP the written statements required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule No. 3526, "Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence," and has discussed Ernst & Young LLP's independence with Ernst & Young LLP, and has considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditor's independence. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Business Overview 
AGNC is an internally-managed REIT that invests predominantly in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities on a leveraged basis. We seek to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns over a wide range of market scenarios through monthly dividends and tangible net asset value accretion, while maintaining the lowest operating cost structure among residential mortgage REITs. We generate income from the interest earned on our investment assets, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investments and hedging activities. As such, our business operations are similar in nature to a levered fixed income investment fund. 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    25

We are committed to executing on our strategy through five key aspects of our business, which collectively constitute our strong value proposition for our stockholders:

(2)  Annualized total economic return is measured from June 30, 2008 through December 31, 2018.

To the extent publicly disclosed by such REITs, operating costs exclude one-time or nonrecurring expenses and direct costs associated with operating  activities, such as loan acquisition costs, securitization costs and servicing expenses. AGNC's operating cost structure is based on average stockholders' equity for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018; it includes compensation  and benefits and general and administrative expenses and excludes non-cash amortization charges and nonrecurring charges (including retention or stay bonuses) associated with AGNC's internalization transaction and other one-time events.

Stockholder Engagement and Response to 2018 Advisory Resolution on Executive Compensation 
Following the results of our 2018 advisory resolution on executive compensation vote, our Board undertook a significant outreach effort to gather feedback from our stockholders on our executive compensation program. In the fall of 2018, we conducted broad outreach to stockholders holding 80% of our institutionally held common stock and comprising 53% of our outstanding common stock. We ultimately met with stockholders holding 48% of our institutionally held common stock and approximately 32% of outstanding common stock and with proxy advisory firms. Our Independent Chair Prue Larocca or our Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee Chair Morris Davis participated in the majority of these discussions. Through this outreach, investors provided feedback on aspects of our program that were viewed positively and retained, and we also discussed their questions and desired changes for certain aspects of our program, as summarized below.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Program in Context 
Until July 2016, AGNC was externally-managed by a wholly owned subsidiary of American Capital. The acquisition of our external manager strengthened our commitment to provide transparent disclosure and a strong stockholder focus, and our Board and management team continue to demonstrate this strength through detailed financial disclosure and strong governance and compensation practices. 
Prior to our Internalization, as an externally-managed REIT, our Board and the Compensation Committee did not have control over the way NEOs were compensated or motivated, and CEO compensation was linked primarily to assets under management. As a result of the Internalization, the Compensation Committee has created a compensation program that aligns with AGNC's financial and strategic objectives, promotes retention of the management team, emphasizes pay-for-performance, enhances alignment of NEOs with stockholders, and maintains a low operating expense structure. Our internal management structure puts us in a position to be more transparent with our stockholders on our executive compensation process, structure, and payouts. The following graphic shows the evolution of our compensation program since the Internalization. 
Since our Internalization, the composition of our NEOs' total target compensation has shifted significantly, with a greater emphasis on performance-based compensation and long-term equity. The following illustrates the shift in our CEO's total compensation at target over this period.

Composition of Our CEO's Total Compensation at Target 
AGNC's Compensation Program in the Context of our Broader Industry 
The Bloomberg Mortgage REIT Index (BBREMTG) includes 20 residential mortgage REITs, which we refer to as the "Resi mREIT Universe." We are the second largest residential mortgage REIT and the largest internally-managed residential mortgage REIT by market capitalization, total assets, and total equity. 
Of the 20 REITs in the Resi mREIT Universe, only seven are internally-managed, meaning that the REIT is directly responsible for determining executive compensation. The remaining 13 REITs in the Resi mREIT Universe are externally managed by a third party and pay a third-party a management fee as a set percentage of equity in lieu of compensating employees directly. This management fee is used to pay the compensation and benefits for the manager's executives and other employees, and compensation decisions regarding the manager's executives are generally determined by the manager rather than the REIT's board of directors. For these externally-managed REITs, the executive compensation arrangements are not fully disclosed or transparent to investors and are often not based on the REIT's performance.

The lack of publicly available compensation information due to the prevalence of external management structures makes it challenging to compare ourselves to other mortgage REIT peers from a compensation perspective. See page 43 for more details on the composition of our compensation comparator group.

Compensation Program in Detail 
Compensation Program Elements 
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to compensate our NEOs in a manner that balances short- and long-term compensation and cash and equity-based compensation. Our NEOs' compensation program includes three primary elements: base salary, short-term incentives in the form of an annual cash bonus, and long-term equity incentives, with a significant portion of incentive compensation subject to company performance and multi-year performance-based vesting for long-term equity awards. 
The Compensation Committee's philosophy on pay mix carries through the entire organization, with all AGNC employees receiving a portion of their compensation in the form of long-term incentives ("LTI"). The proportion of an individual's target total direct compensation opportunity that is in the form of variable incentive-based elements versus fixed elements is directly correlated to the individual's level of responsibility and role in 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    33 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 the organization. Generally, higher level employees have higher proportions of incentive-based compensation in their target mix. Similarly, within the incentive-based elements, the proportion of LTI generally increases with the individual's level of responsibility in the organization.
For 2018, 81% of average target compensation of our NEOs consisted of short-term and long-term incentive compensation, a 5% increase from 77% in 2017. For 2019, 85% of average target compensation of our NEOs consists of short- and long-term incentive compensation; 47% will be long-term incentives, and at least 50% of long-term incentives for each NEO will be tied to performance. 
Base Salary 
Base salary provides a fixed, baseline level of cash compensation to our NEOs and is a fixed expense for the Company. The Compensation Committee established base salaries for our NEOs considering a variety of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• current economic conditions and the competitive market for executive officers  
• pay history and contractual obligations in effect at the time of the Internalization  
• the scope of each executive officer's responsibilities  
• the highly complex and unique services provided by our NEOs  
• the desire to retain our NEOs during the period following our Internalization  
• the duties and responsibilities of the NEOs  
• internal and external pay equity  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries for our NEOs annually and at the time of a promotion or other change in responsibilities, and salaries may be adjusted after considering the above factors. 
At the time of the Internalization, Mr. Kain's annual base salary was $4.4 million. The Compensation Committee and Mr. Kain recognized that the compensation arrangements set forth in his existing employment agreement would need to be adjusted following the Internalization to more closely align NEO compensation with the Company's compensation philosophy and stockholder interests. Mr. Kain worked with the Compensation Committee following the Internalization to adjust his overall compensation package to phase in a reduction in his base salary to $1.8 million in 2018. In response to feedback received as part of our stockholder outreach efforts in 2018 and to further align his compensation with our pay for performance compensation philosophy, effective February 1, 2019, Mr. Kain has agreed to a further 50% reduction in his base salary to $900,000 per year. This reduction in base salary was then reallocated to his target performance-based long-term equity incentive awards. This represents an 80% cumulative reduction in Mr. Kain's annual base salary since 2016.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The annual base salaries, as set forth in the table below, are the minimum levels required in each executive's respective employment arrangement. These levels were determined by the Compensation Committee, in consultation with FW Cook, taking into account salary history and the terms of the NEO's employment in effect at the time of the Internalization, the highly complex and unique services provided by our NEOs, the desire to retain our NEOs during the period following our Internalization, the duties and responsibilities of the NEOs, and internal and external pay equity. Other than Mr. Kain's reduction in base salary, the only other change to base salary in 2019 is a $50,000 increase for Ms. Bell in light of her increased responsibilities and performance following her appointment as our CFO effective March 31, 2018.

Annual Bonus 
The Compensation Committee has established performance criteria for short-term incentives that directly correspond to the areas of greatest impact to our short- and long-term performance and operations, creating a direct connection between business success and our NEO's compensation. Each NEO's target for short-term incentive compensation, set forth in the table below for 2018 and 2019, is determined based on an evaluation of the same factors used in setting base salaries. 
In response to feedback we received from investors in 2018 requesting that a larger percentage of CEO compensation be in the form of long-term incentive compensation, Mr. Kain's annual bonus target in 2019 was reduced by $1.8 million, with such amount being reallocated to his target performance-based long-term incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee increased Ms. Bell's annual bonus target for 2019 after considering her high level of performance following her assumption of the CFO role and the resulting increase in her responsibilities.

[END TABLE]
Corporate Scorecard for Calculating Incentive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee uses a Corporate Scorecard to assist in its evaluation and awarding of an annual cash bonus. Under the Corporate Scorecard, actual payouts can range from 0% to 150% for each metric, with category and metric weights as assigned by the Compensation Committee, and payouts for performance 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    35 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 between each measure are determined through linear interpolation. For 2018, the cash bonuses for Messrs. Kain and Federico were based solely on achievement of the scorecard measures. The other NEOs' short-term cash incentives were based predominantly on the Corporate Scorecard measures and to a lesser extent on personal performance. 
Our 2018 Corporate Scorecard is detailed in the table below and reflects revisions to increase rigor as compared to the 2017 Corporate Scorecard. In January 2018, the Compensation Committee set the levels for each metric based on an evaluation of historic performance over a five-year period and our forecast for 2018. The threshold and outperformance measures were determined based on a number of factors, including an evaluation of standard deviations from the target levels. The Compensation Committee's analysis included back-testing the financial measures against performance in the prior five year period to evaluate on a hypothetical basis what payouts would have been under financial measures if applied in those periods. Compared to 2017, our 2018 Corporate Scorecard reflects more rigorous performance standards and, had it been applied over the prior five year period, would have resulted in an average annual payout of less than 100% of target. 
Based on this evaluation, for 2018, the Committee increased the relative weighting of the financial measures from 60% in 2017 to 65% (with a corresponding decrease in operational and strategic metrics from 30% to 25%) and increased the threshold, target, and outperformance levels for our Relative Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio by 2.5% each. The operating expense measure also was made more rigorous relative to 2018 in light of 2017 results (our first full year following the Internalization) and anticipated operating expenses for 2018. However, the Committee did not change the absolute or relative economic return goals, as they were deemed appropriately challenging in light of the Company's forecast for 2018 and historic analysis.

The 2018 Corporate Scorecard included both financial and operational/strategic metrics, as well as a metric for the management of MTGE, all of which corresponded to the core elements of our value proposition for stockholders. We believe these goals and measures effectively align NEO short-term incentives with financial, strategic, and operational performance of greatest import to our business. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The financial measures emphasized our interest in common stockholders' economic returns, a strong common  stock trading price to tangible book value relative to our peers, and our low-cost operating structure.  
• The strategic and operational objectives selected supported our risk management discipline and high-quality  reporting and disclosure. The strategic measures also emphasized our relationships with investors, including ongoing engagement with our stockholders.  
• A portion of the Corporate Scorecard was tied to goals based on the management of MTGE because the management  fees and expense reimbursements received from MTGE offset a portion of our operating expenses, and our management team gained broader market insights and knowledge given MTGE's different investment scope and greater exposure to credit risk. In  light of the sale of MTGE to a third-party and termination of the MTGE management contract, our Board also considered the work required by our personnel to transition the management of MTGE and ensure receipt of the termination fee.

2018 Corporate Scorecard Incentive Compensation Determination 
Following a review of each of the three components of the 2018 Corporate Scorecard, the Compensation Committee calculated a total scorecard payout for 2018 of 103.3%. A more detailed discussion regarding each of the three elements included in the Corporate Scorecard is provided below.

Financial Metric Results 
Based on our 2018 Corporate Scorecard, a review of our 2018 financial performance indicated a 105.0% payout for the financial metric portion. AGNC exceeded the performance targets for relative economic return, relative price-to-tangible book ratio and net operating expense ratio. However, we underperformed on the absolute economic return metric, in part, as a result of increased interest rate volatility and widening Agency MBS spreads, largely during the fourth quarter. 
2018 Operational and Strategic Review 
2018 marked our second full year as an internally-managed REIT. In evaluating our performance under the operational and strategic objectives portion of the scorecard, the Compensation Committee considered the following domains: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Finance / Accounting / Legal;  
• Risk and Liability Management;  
• Investor Relations;  
• Strategic Initiatives; and  
• Information Technology.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee noted the following achievements, among others, in determining that the Company had met target expectations on the operational and strategic objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Raised over $2.6 billion in capital at a premium to tangible net book value through three common stock  offerings and our at-the-market ("ATM") program, further lowering our operating costs by leveraging our largely fixed costs over a larger capital base   
[END TABLE]
38    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased focus on communication with the investor community on topics including executive compensation and ESG,  which resulted in key actions taken in response to stockholder feedback  
• Expanded our broker-dealer operations by increasing funding activity conducted through Bethesda Securities, our  wholly owned broker-dealer subsidiary, from $16.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $26.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, generating significant interest expense savings and reducing collateral haircuts through direct access to  the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  
• Registered a new $1 billion ATM program with additional sales agents  
• Implemented new IT security measures to continually enhance our information security profile   
[END TABLE]
These achievements were in addition to business operations that supported our timely and accurate financial reporting, risk management and compliance activities, and review of strategic opportunities. The Compensation Committee thus determined that these accomplishments merited a 100% payout for the operational and strategic portion of the Corporate Scorecard. 
MTGE Manager Results 
The Compensation Committee considered both MTGE's financial performance under the Company's management and the successful outcome of MTGE's sale process in evaluating this component of the corporate scorecard. MTGE produced strong financial results during the first two quarters of 2018 under the Company's management prior to the announcement of the acquisition and was ultimately acquired at a premium to its book value, producing an excellent outcome for stockholders of MTGE. Management devoted significant time and resources to facilitate a smooth sale process and closing, including during the due diligence period and the transfer of assets. Coincident with the closing of the MTGE sale, the Company also received a $41.7 million termination fee pursuant to its management contract. In light of MTGE's strong financial performance and efforts of Company employees in facilitating the sale and closing of the MTGE transaction, the Compensation Committee determined that a 100% payout under the MTGE manager component of the scorecard was warranted. 
Individual Bonus Decisions 
Short-term incentives for Messrs. Kain and Federico in 2018 were based solely on achievement of the Corporate Scorecard measures. Based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of the 2018 Corporate Scorecard, this resulted in a payout of 103.3% of target for Messrs. Kain and Federico. 
Other NEOs' short-term cash incentives were based predominantly on the Corporate Scorecard measures and to a lesser extent on an individual performance assessment. Mr. Kuehl was awarded a cash bonus at 102.6% of his target based on a relative weighting of the Corporate Scorecard at 80% and his personal performance at 20% (awarded at target). In evaluating his personal performance, the Compensation Committee considered the significant positive impact that his management of the Agency portfolio had on the Company's overall performance in 2018, which is evident from the Company's performance relative to the Agency REIT Peer Group. Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack each were awarded 102.0% of their target bonus, which reflects a relative weighting of the Corporate Scorecard at 60% and their individual personal performance at 40% (awarded at target). For Ms. Bell, the Compensation Committee considered her performance in her first year as our CFO and her ongoing and significant contributions in oversight of our accounting, tax, and treasury operations, financial planning, and reporting obligations. For Mr. Pas, the Compensation Committee considered his contributions in managing the Company's growing investment portfolio of non-Agency securities, and for Mr. Pollack, the Compensation Committee reviewed his contributions to a number of our 2018 operational achievements, including our capital raising activities, increased stockholder engagement, the successful sale of MTGE and receipt of the $41.7 million termination fee pursuant to the MTGE management agreement, and his ongoing attention to improving our governance.

2019 Corporate Scorecard 
During our stockholder engagements in 2018, some investors commented on the complexity of our Corporate Scorecard and sought clarity around the rigor of the financial measures set. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the appropriateness of the Corporate Scorecard and has implemented further changes to the Company's scorecard for 2019. As in 2018, the Compensation Committee set financial measures following its review of back-testing over a multi-year period and our forecast for 2019. As a result of these changes:

In addition, other changes to the scorecard for 2019 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The target level for our relative  price-to-tangible book ratio has been increased to 3.5% (as compared to 2.5% under the 2018 scorecard), and the range associated with our relative price-to-book ratio has been correspondingly increased and expanded. The threshold and outperformance levels will be (6.5%) and 11.0%, respectively, as compared to (4.5%) and  7.5% in 2018.  
• The range associated with our relative economic return metric has been expanded, with threshold and  outperformance levels set at (6.0%) and 4.5%, respectively (as compared to (5.0%) and 3.0%, respectively, under the 2018 scorecard).  
• The strategic and operational objectives have been realigned more directly to the Company's Value  Proposition, consisting of goals that promote the Company's Highly Efficient Operating Cost Structure, Disciplined Risk Management, Stockholder Focus, and Liquidity and Scale.  
• The peer group used has been updated to add Two Harbors Investment Corp., Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., and  Dynex Capital, Inc. Following the sale of CYS Investments, Inc. in 2018, the Company's peer group was reduced to four companies. The Compensation Committee determined that an increase to the size of this group was necessary to provide  a reasonable basis for comparison. The Compensation Committee selected the new peers based upon several criteria, including a sufficient allocation of capital to Agency mortgage-backed securities and a minimum size threshold.   
[END TABLE]
Equity Incentive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee believes that equity incentive compensation is an important component of our NEO compensation package and is critical in attracting, motivating, and retaining outstanding employees. Equity incentive compensation is intended to closely align our NEOs' and other employees' interests with our long-term success and promote long-term employee retention. Our long-term incentive program consisted of a combination of performance-based RSUs, time-vesting RSUs, and awards in the AGNC Mortgage Management, LLC Performance Incentive Plan—MTGE (the "MTGE PIP"). The allocation among performance-based RSUs, time-vesting RSUs, and MTGE PIP grants varied among each of our NEOs. We incorporated MTGE PIP awards into our compensation program in light of the importance of the management of MTGE to AGNC's business at that time. The MTGE PIP, which was a small portion of the long-term incentive compensation paid to our NEOs, helped to facilitate the alignment of compensation for the Company's personnel who were involved in the management of MTGE with MTGE's actual performance. With the termination of the MTGE management contract in October 2018, MTGE PIP awards will no longer be made to AGNC NEOs. 
The MTGE PIP shares granted to our NEOs in 2018 accounted for 6% of our total NEO compensation in 2018 and were also to vest over a three-year period. Grants of time-based RSU awards made in 2018 vest on a pro-rata basis annually over a three-year period. Following the closing of the sale of MTGE in September 2018, our Board determined that it would be appropriate to accelerate the vesting of the MTGE PIP shares for all employees, as the consideration received for the PIP awards following the MTGE acquisition no longer served to incent management and align their interests with stockholders. Officers of the Company who had previously elected to defer distribution of their PIP awards were granted Deferred Stock Unit awards in AGNC under the 2016 Plan in exchange for their deferred MTGE PIP awards, thereby further strengthening alignment with AGNC stockholders.

To establish rigorous economic thresholds and motivate long-term performance, the awards vest at the end of a three-year performance period based 50% on our absolute

 economic return and 50% on our economic return relative to the economic returns of an unweighted average of the Agency REIT Peer Group each as compared to threshold, target, and outperformance levels established by the Compensation Committee (set forth in the following table). In establishing the metrics for relative economic return, the Compensation Committee evaluates historical returns for us and our peers.

Absolute and relative economic returns are calculated on a cumulative basis over the three-year vesting period. Achievement of these goals will be determined in the same manner, including the same peer group, as described above with respect to short-term incentive awards. For performance between the threshold, target, and outperformance measures, the number of shares vested will be determined through linear interpolation. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
The 2018 long-term incentive awards made by the Compensation Committee were at each NEO's target levels as were specified in their respective employment agreement or offer letter, as applicable, and are reflected in the following table:

2019 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
As discussed above, to respond to stockholder feedback, the Compensation Committee evaluated the appropriateness of the pay mix of its NEOs, and we implemented the following changes for 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Kain's compensation mix has been revised such that going forward 56% of his total compensation at  target will consist of long-term incentive awards, and 67% of those awards will be performance-based.  
• The Company took steps to ensure that at least 50% of the long-term incentives granted to its NEOs consisted of  performance-based awards. Specifically, the Company entered into new employment arrangements with Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack to increase their target level of long-term incentive compensation overall and to clarify that 50% of their  target long-term incentive compensation will be performance-based. Because 50% of Messrs. Federico and Kuehl's target long-term incentives already consisted of performance-based awards, the Compensation Committee did not make further adjustment  to their pay mix for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Savings and Health and Welfare Benefits 
Our executive officers participate in a broad-based 401(k) retirement savings plan generally applicable to all our employees, which includes an opportunity to receive employer matching contributions. We do not currently provide for pension plans, supplemental retirement plans, or deferred compensation plans (other than the ability to elect to defer payments of long-term incentive awards) for our executive officers. In addition, all of our executive officers also participate in medical, dental, vision, disability, life and long-term care insurance, and qualified transportation benefits that are provided generally to our employees. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
We do not believe our executive officers should receive special perquisites and benefits and do not currently provide our executive officers with any perquisites or other personal benefits that are not available on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees. 
Compensation Decision Process 
Compensation Comparator Group 
AGNC's internal management structure, size and scale relative to residential mortgage REITs, and our Agency mortgage-backed securities investment focus are significant differentiators relative to other potential comparative public companies, and have made identifying a peer group for AGNC challenging. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Of the 20 REITs in the Resi mREIT Universe, only seven are internally-managed. This means that compensation data  is available and that the REIT is directly responsible for determining executive compensation at only seven of the 20. The other 13 REITs in this index are externally-managed, pay a third-party a management fee as a set percentage of equity in lieu  of compensating employees directly, and do not disclose the compensation paid to individual NEOs.  
• Within the Resi mREIT Universe, AGNC is the second largest residential mortgage REIT and the largest  internally-managed residential mortgage REIT by most meaningful financial measures including market capitalization, total assets, and total equity. AGNC is more than two and a half times larger than the next largest internally-managed residential  mortgage REIT, based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2018.  
• Given our specific business and that our CEO is also our Chief Investment Officer and acts as our portfolio  manager, the most comparable positions are hedge funds, trading desks, and portfolio managers whose pay is not public and is routinely very high.

As a result, the Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy to benchmark compensation levels against comparative companies. However, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of FW Cook, reviews compensation levels and practices at various financial services companies. In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation practices at 18 companies, including six internally-managed publicly-traded mortgage REITs and 12 publicly-traded asset management companies and non-bank financial services companies. The Compensation Committee determined the highly specialized and unique skill sets required of executives of these industries are most comparable to those required of AGNC's NEOs, though none are an exact match for our Company.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
For purposes of evaluating our performance and operations under our 2018 Corporate Scorecard, the Compensation Committee uses a subset of the Resi mREIT Universe, which we refer to herein as the "Agency REIT Peer Group." These REITs are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annaly Capital Management, Inc.  
• CYS Investments, Inc.  
• Capstead Mortgage Corporation  
• ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.  
• Anworth Mortgage Asset Corporation  
[END TABLE]
The Agency REIT Peer Group companies have portfolios and investment objectives that most closely resemble our own focus on Agency securities. Non-Agency REITs in the Resi mREIT Universe have more diverse portfolios and strategies that place a greater emphasis on credit-sensitive assets than our portfolio and those of our Agency REIT Peer Group. As such, these REITs would be expected to achieve divergent returns from our own Agency security-focused portfolio through various economic cycles and conditions. The Compensation Committee thus determined that our economic returns and trading price relative to book value are appropriately measured against a simple, unweighted average of the Agency REIT Peer Group for purposes of determining our relative performance. Only one of the five REITs in the Agency REIT Peer Group (Capstead Mortgage Corporation) was included in the group of companies whose executive compensation practices were reviewed by the Committee; the other companies are either significantly smaller than us or externally-managed and therefore do not disclose compensation of their executives. 
The Compensation Committee continues to evaluate our peer construction in response to changes in market conditions and the REIT sector. In addition, CYS Investments was acquired in July 2018 by Two Harbors Investment Corp., which would have led to a reduction in the number of companies in the Agency REIT Peer Group. The Compensation Committee concluded that changes to the Agency REIT Peer Group to be used for relative performance measures were appropriate given recent merger activity in the sector, challenges in making meaningful comparisons if the peer group were to consist of only four companies, and the evolving business models of other REITs. The Compensation Committee has accordingly added other residential mortgage REITs having a meaningful concentration of Agency securities to the Agency REIT Peer Group to be used in setting relative measures in the 2019 Corporate Scorecard and performance-based long-term incentive awards. These additional companies are Two Harbors Investment Corp., Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., and Dynex Capital, Inc. 
Role of Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our Compensation Committee, which is comprised of five independent directors, is responsible for establishing and overseeing our philosophy regarding executive compensation and makes all decisions relating to the compensation of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for ensuring that the total compensation offered to our executive officers is fair, competitive, and motivates high performance. The terms of any employment agreements with our NEOs and actions on compensation under the employment agreements are also under the primary direction of the Compensation Committee. Decisions related to CEO compensation are reviewed and approved by the Company's independent directors based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of goals and objectives. 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the Company's compensation policies and programs and makes any modifications that the Committee deems necessary or advisable, subject to the terms of such 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    45 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 policies or programs. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the Company's goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the NEOs and other employees of the Company. Our Compensation Committee focuses on implementing an overall compensation program that emphasizes pay based on performance and alignment of interests with stockholders. 
Role of Management 
All compensation decisions related to our executive officers are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or independent directors of our Board. The Compensation Committee considers the advice and counsel of the CEO when evaluating compensation of the other NEOs given his direct day-to-day working and supervisory relationship with those executives. Taking this feedback into consideration, the Compensation Committee engages in discussions and either determines the compensation of our NEOs or, with respect to the CEO or otherwise at its option, makes a final recommendation to the Board related to compensation paid to NEOs. Our CEO is not present and does not participate in the portions of meetings of the Compensation Committee or of the Board at which his performance is evaluated and his compensation is discussed and determined; only independent directors participate in such matters. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select, retain, and terminate compensation consultants. The Compensation Committee has retained FW Cook to provide advice and counsel on executive compensation opportunities and program design and structure. Representatives of FW Cook attended certain meetings of the Compensation Committee, including meeting with members of the Compensation Committee without members of management present. FW Cook assisted the Compensation Committee in its analysis and evaluation of our initial executive compensation program, practices, and communications, and provided the Compensation Committee with market data and analysis of certain comparator companies who hire personnel and executives with similar skills and experience as our executive management team. FW Cook also provided assistance with our Corporate Scorecard, our long-term incentive awards, the setting of measures for performance-based incentive compensation, and other work that has informed executive compensation decisions. 
Risk Assessment and Compensation 
The Compensation Committee regularly monitors the risks and rewards associated with our compensation program. The Compensation Committee established our compensation program with the intent to align our interests with stockholders and prevent unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. We believe that our compensation policies and practices are well balanced and designed to avoid creating incentives that encourage unnecessary or excessive risks that could potentially have a material adverse effect on the Company. We use variable compensation for all of our NEOs, with a focus on performance. We have designed a compensation program with a mix of short- and long-term incentives to ensure management focuses on the long-term impact of short-term decisions and that management's interests are aligned with stockholders. Compliance with the operational risk management guidelines designed to address excessive risk taking and approved by our Board is an integral part of the strategic and operational objectives of the Corporate Scorecard used for short-term incentive compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee continually assesses our executive compensation programs and has implemented additional policies and practices that we believe have further mitigated compensation driven risk, including the adoption of a clawback policy applicable to the period following the Internalization and senior executive officer stock ownership guidelines. 
46    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Other Compensation Policies and Practices 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We strongly encourage all of our executive officers to hold a significant number of shares of Company common stock. We have adopted stock ownership guidelines for our most senior officers requiring them to own, within five years of adoption of the policy or becoming subject to the policy, a minimum number of shares of our common stock based on a multiple of base salary. The requirement is 6x for our CEO and Chief Investment Officer and 3x for our President and any Executive Vice President. Each is expected to retain at least 50% of the shares of common stock received upon vesting or earn-out of stock-based compensation, net of any shares withheld or sold to pay taxes on such income, until the foregoing ownership requirements are met. Shares of time-vested restricted stock units granted under the 2016 Plan (whether vested, unvested, or subject to a deferral election) are included in determining the number of shares held for this purpose, net of anticipated tax withholdings. Shares of unvested performance-based RSUs are not included for this purpose prior to completion of the applicable performance period. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Kain held in excess of 12x, and Messrs. Federico and Kuehl each held in excess of 6x their respective 2018 base salary calculated in accordance with our guidelines. 
The following table sets forth the total stock ownership of all our NEOs, including beneficially owned, unvested, and deferred shares, as calculated pursuant to our stock ownership guidelines as of February 22, 2019:

[END TABLE]
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy 
Our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting our executive officers and directors from any hedging, pledging, or entering into margin loans with respect to any shares of our common stock or from engaging in short sales of our common stock or entering into any other transaction or derivative agreement where he or she would earn a profit based on a decline of our stock price. By way of example, transactions prohibited under the policy may include options, short sales, puts, calls, or derivative actions such as forwards, futures, or swaps. 
Clawback Policy 
We have adopted a clawback policy relating to recovery of certain excess performance-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement by the Company due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws resulting at least in part from the willful fraud, dishonesty, or recklessness of one of the Company's executive officers in the performance of his or her duties to the Company. Under this policy, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery of the portion of any performance-based compensation paid to our executive officers that would not have been earned had the Company's restated financial statements been used in the determination of the amount of performance-based compensation originally awarded. This policy includes a three year look back period and applies to compensation paid to our executive officers following the Internalization. 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    47 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Employment Agreements 
At the time of the Internalization, the Company inherited the employment agreements that Messrs. Kain, Federico, and Kuehl had in place with our external manager. The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of FW Cook, worked with each of these executives, who voluntarily agreed to negotiate new employment agreements that would shift the balance of their compensation from fixed elements to incentive compensation, thereby further aligning their interests with those of our stockholders on a short- and long-term basis. These new employment agreements, entered into in November 2016, secured the retention of these executives who had a track-record of strong performance. They also are intended to provide appropriate and balanced incentives toward achieving the annual and long-term strategic objectives set by the Compensation Committee and to create a stronger alignment of interests between our executives and our stockholders. 
In connection with the renegotiation of his employment agreement in 2016, Mr. Kain voluntarily agreed to significant reductions to his base and target incentive compensation to be implemented over the 18-month period following the Internalization. Mr. Kain's base compensation prior to the Internalization and pursuant to the terms of his prior employment contract was indexed to overall stockholders' equity of the Company and MTGE such that issuances of new equity in either company could result in an increase in his base pay. Mr. Kain's annual base salary for 2018 was reduced to $1.8 million, reflecting a reduction of approximately $2.6 million from his base salary of $4.4 million at the time of the Internalization. In 2018, 88% of Mr. Kain's target total compensation was comprised of incentive compensation, and almost 70% of his total compensation was linked to performance. 
During our stockholder engagement in 2018, a number of investors expressed a desire to see a greater percentage of CEO compensation be in the form of long-term incentive awards with a specific emphasis toward performance-based long-term incentive awards. The Compensation Committee and Mr. Kain carefully considered this feedback and mutually agreed to a number of changes to address this input. Thus, effective February 1, 2019, 56% of Mr. Kain's target compensation will be in the form of long-term incentive awards, and 67% of his target level of long-term incentive awards will be performance-based awards vesting after completion of a three-year performance period. This shift in pay mix was accomplished through a 50% reduction in base salary to $900,000, a $1.8 million reduction of target bonus to $5.4 million and a corresponding $2.7 million increase in target performance-based long-term equity incentives.     
Mr. Kain's revised employment agreement also provides that if his employment terminates after March 15, 2021 by reason of a voluntary termination as a result of retirement and pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Kain's long-term time-based incentive awards that are outstanding at the time of his retirement would vest in full at such time. His performance-based incentive awards would vest on the same terms as though Mr. Kain had remained employed by the Company for the remainder of the vesting period applicable to such awards, provided that he continued to comply with certain covenants contained in the agreement. Vesting of any long-term incentive awards granted to Mr. Kain in the year of his retirement would apply only to a pro rata portion of the awards based on the number of full calendar months Mr. Kain was employed in such year. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation of our executive officers on an annual basis and will make adjustments when warranted by personal performance and internal and external pay equity. After evaluating the Company's performance and recognizing the valuable contributions that each of the NEOs make to the Company, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to have employment contracts in place with all of our NEOs. 
48    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The following changes were made to promote the retention of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack and further stockholder alignment by emphasizing performance-vested equity as a significant portion of long-term incentives and overall target compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On January 25, 2019, the Company entered into employment agreements with Ms. Bell and Mr. Pas,  effective January 1, 2019.  
• Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement effective January 1, 2019, Ms. Bell's base  salary was increased from $450,000 to $500,000 per year, and her target annual cash bonus was increased from two-thirds of her base salary to 100%. In addition, her long-term equity incentive award target was  increased to 150% of her base salary, from a prior target of 66%.  
• Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Pas's annual base salary and target annual cash bonus were  unchanged from 2017 at $425,000 and 150% of his base salary, respectively. His long-term equity incentive award target was increased to 176% of his base salary, from a prior target of 150%.  
• Each of Ms. Bell and Mr. Pas will be entitled to severance benefits as described in greater detail  below. See page 55.  
• Each of Ms. Bell and Mr. Pas are now subject to restrictive covenants if their employment with the  Company is terminated.  
• The Compensation Committee also elected to amend Mr. Pollack's agreement effective January 1, 2019  to increase his long-term equity incentive award target from 100% to 150% of his base salary.  
• Under the amended arrangements for these three NEOs, 50% of their long-term incentive compensation awards will be  performance-based.  
[END TABLE]
The employment agreements include certain severance payments and benefits if an NEO that is party to an employment agreement is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the NEO for "good reason," as each term is defined in each respective employment agreement and were the result of arms-length negotiations with these NEOs. The severance provisions included in the employment agreements related to a change of control include a "double trigger" requirement, which we determined was appropriate and in the best interest of our stockholders. See "Severance and Change of Control Payments" below. The employment agreements with these NEOs also include covenants related to post-employment obligations in areas such as competition with us, solicitation of our employees, and the confidentiality of certain information. 
We completed the Internalization in part to reduce our overall cost of operations and to ensure the ongoing continuity of our business and relationship with our portfolio management team. As part of a retention bonus award granted in connection with the Internalization, Ms. Bell and Mr. Pas (each of whom was not an NEO of the Company at the time this award was granted) received a bonus of $159,375 and $398,438, respectively, on each of March 1, 2017 and March 1, 2018. 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally prohibited any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million in any taxable year to an executive officer who is named in the Summary Compensation Table. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, eliminated exceptions for performance-based compensation, among other things, subject to a special rule that "grandfathered" certain awards and arrangements in effect on or before November 2, 2017. In structuring our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee had considered this and other provisions; however, the Compensation Committee did not believe that it was necessarily in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders for all compensation to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) for deductibility. 
AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement    49 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 Annual bonuses and awards made under the 2016 Plan and the MTGE PIP were not qualified performance awards under Section 162(m), as the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to maintain flexibility that would prevent such compensation from qualifying as performance-based under Section 162(m). As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal and state corporate income tax and therefore tax deductions are less valuable to us than to many other corporations. From and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1 million to our NEOs generally will not be deductible. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits the deductibility of compensation paid to the NEOs, the Committee will continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of the Company and our stockholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations.

Prior to the Internalization on July 1, 2016 and to the extent that our NEOs provided service to us, they were compensated by our former external manager and not directly by the Company. 
In the column "Salary," we disclose the amount of base salary paid to the NEO during the fiscal year. See "Employment Agreements" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," above, for a description of the base salaries payable under each NEO's employment agreement. 
In the column "Bonus," we disclose the amount of short-term cash incentive payments earned by the NEO during the fiscal year. See "Annual Cash Bonus" for a description of the annual scorecard for calculating the cash component of our incentive compensation awards for 2018 that were paid in 2019, and which are included in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018. In the column "Stock Awards," we disclose awards of RSUs under the 2016 Plan, which includes both performance-based vesting and time-based vesting awards. The grant date fair value of the RSU awards assumes performance achievement at 100% of the target amount. Performance payouts may range from 0% to 200% of the target amount based on actual performance achieved. See "Equity Incentive Compensation" under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," above.

(1)  As noted above, because our executive officers prior to the Internalization (which closed on July 1, 2016)  received compensation from our external manager or its affiliates and not us, our 2016 compensation includes only six months of compensation. It also does not include annual long-term incentive awards under the 2016 Plan or MTGE PIP, which were  first made in February 2017, but does include one-time grants made to Messrs. Federico and Kuehl in 2016 pursuant to their amended employment agreements.  
(2)  The bonus amounts reflected in the table above include a retention bonus payment of $159,375 paid to Ms. Bell in  March 2018, and a retention bonus payment of $398,438 paid to Mr. Pas in each of March 2017 and March 2018 in connection with the Internalization and are discussed herein on page 49. In our 2018 proxy, we described this payment to Mr. Pas in the  compensation discussion and analysis but inadvertently omitted it from the calculations included in the summary compensation table.  
(3)  The amounts reported in the "Stock Awards" column represent the grant date fair value of each award  calculated in accordance with ASC 718, as required by SEC regulations. The fair market value of a stock award is based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant.

Severance and Change of Control Payments 
Employment Agreements 
Each of the employment agreements with Ms. Bell and Messrs. Kain, Federico, Kuehl, Pas, and Pollack contains provisions for payments upon certain events as set forth below. References to severance and change of control provisions in the paragraphs below for Mr. Kain are pursuant to his employment agreement that became

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 effective on February 1, 2019 and for Ms. Bell and Mr. Pas, the provisions are pursuant to each of their respective employment agreements that became effective on January 1, 2019. 
Termination by the Board Without Cause or Termination by the Executive for Good Reason 
If the employment of Ms. Bell or Messrs. Kain, Federico, Kuehl, Pas, or Pollack terminates by reason of a Termination Without Cause or Termination For Good Reason, each as defined in their employment agreements, and such termination does not occur during the 21-month period (24 months in the case of Ms. Bell or Messrs. Pas or Pollack) following a Change of Control, each such executive would be entitled to the following payments from the Company, as applicable, in addition to the payments listed below under "All Terminations" (a) an amount equal to the product of (i) 2.5 for Mr. Kain, 1.5 for Mr. Federico or 1.0 for Ms. Bell or Messrs. Kuehl, Pas, and Pollack, multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the executive's annual base salary at the time of such termination, plus (B) the target value of the executive's annual cash bonus for the year in which such termination occurs (the "Severance Amount"), paid over 30 for Mr. Kain, 18 for Mr. Federico, and 12 months to Ms. Bell and Messrs. Kuehl, Pas, and Pollack, respectively; (b) a pro rata portion of the annual cash bonus the executive would have been entitled to receive if he or she had remained employed through December 31 of the year in which such termination occurs; (c) reimbursements under COBRA, or substitute payments, for the executive and his or her eligible dependents for up to 18 months (12 months in the case of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack); (d) acceleration of any outstanding unvested equity awards; and (e) if such termination had occurred on or prior to December 31, 2018 (for Messrs. Federico and Kuehl), a pro rata portion of the aggregate target fair value of the executive's annual long-term incentive award for the portion of the year elapsed prior to termination, payable in a single lump sum on the first payroll date following the 60th day after termination (the "Pro Rata LTIA Payment"). In addition, if Mr. Kuehl remains unemployed on the first anniversary of such termination, he would be entitled to an amount equal to the product of 0.5, multiplied by the sum of his annual base salary at the time of such termination, plus the target value of his annual cash bonus for the year in which such termination occurred, paid over the following six months. 
Termination by the Board Without Cause or Termination by the Executive For Good Reason Following a Change of Control 
If the employment of Ms. Bell or Messrs. Kain, Federico, Kuehl, Pas, or Pollack terminates by reason of a Termination Without Cause or Termination For Good Reason, and such termination occurs during the 21-month period following a Change of Control (24-months in the case of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack), as defined in their employment agreements, each such executive would be entitled to the following (as applicable), in addition to the payments listed below under "All Terminations": (a) an amount equal to the product of (i) 2.5 (for Mr. Kain), 1.5 (for Messrs. Federico or Kuehl) or 1.0 (for Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack), multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) the executive's annual base salary at the time of such termination, plus (B) the target value of the executive's annual cash bonus for the year in which such termination occurs, paid in a lump sum; (b) a pro rata portion of the target value of his or her annual cash bonus for the year in which such termination occurs (as determined by the Compensation Committee but assuming that all qualitative and subjective performance metrics were achieved at their target level); (c) COBRA reimbursements (or substitute payments) for the executive and his or her eligible dependents for up to 18 months (12 months in the case of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack); (d) acceleration of any outstanding unvested equity awards; and (e) if such termination had occurred on or prior to December 31, 2018 (for Messrs. Federico and Kuehl), the Pro Rata LTIA Payment. 
Death or Disability 
If the employment period of Ms. Bell or Messrs. Kain, Federico, Kuehl, Pas, or Pollack terminates early by reason of death or disability, each executive (or his or her estate or eligible dependents, if applicable) is 
56    AGNC INVESTMENT CORP. – Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 entitled to receive, in addition to the payments listed below under "All Terminations": (i) a pro rata portion of the annual cash bonus the executive would have been entitled to receive if he or she had remained employed through December 31 of the year in which such termination occurs (as determined by the Compensation Committee but assuming that the executive achieved all qualitative and subjective performance metrics at their target level), payable in a lump sum; (ii) COBRA reimbursements (or substitute payments) for the executive and his or her eligible dependents for up to 18 months (12 months in the case of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Pas and Pollack); (iii) acceleration of any outstanding unvested equity awards; and (iv) if such termination had occurred on or prior to December 31, 2018 for Messrs. Federico and Kuehl, the Pro Rata LTIA Payment. 
All Terminations 
If the employment period of Ms. Bell and Messrs. Kain, Federico, Kuehl, Pas, or Pollack terminates early for any reason, each executive is entitled to receive (i) any earned but unpaid base salary; (ii) any annual cash bonus that has been earned for a calendar year prior to termination but is unpaid (but only if not a Termination For Cause or a voluntary termination by the executive for any reason other than Good Reason); (iii) any unpaid reimbursable expenses that have been incurred by the executive; (iv) any plan benefits which by their terms extend beyond termination of employment; and (v) any COBRA benefits generally available to employees. 
In addition, each of the employment agreements contains a non-competition provision that prevents the officer from participating as an officer, employee, director, partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, in any type of business that engages in the Company's business for a certain restricted period. Each of the employment agreements also contains a provision preventing the executive from soliciting any of our employees or interfering in a similar manner with our business during such restricted period. 
Equity Plans 
The 2016 Plan includes "double-trigger" acceleration provisions with respect to the vesting of awards in connection with a Change of Control of the Company (as defined in the 2016 Plan). Under the 2016 Plan, the vesting of awards may accelerate in connection with a Change of Control where either (1) within a specified period the participant experiences a qualifying termination of employment or service, as applicable, in a manner described in the award agreement or (2) the award is not continued, assumed, or converted into a replacement award in a manner described in the applicable award agreement. 
The following table summarizes the estimated payments to be made under the employment or letter agreement for each NEO at, following, or in connection with any termination of employment, including by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason, death or disability and upon a change of control. In accordance with SEC regulations, the following table does not include any amount to be provided to an NEO under any arrangement that does not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of the NEO and that are available generally to all salaried employees. Also, the following table does not duplicate information already provided in the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end table, except to the extent that the amount payable to the NEO would be enhanced by the termination event. The amounts in the following table are hypothetical and based on SEC regulations. Actual payments will depend on the circumstances and timing of any termination. 
In accordance with SEC regulations, for purposes of the quantitative disclosure in the following table, we have assumed that the termination took place on December 31, 2018, and that the price per share of our common stock is the closing market price as of December 31, 2018, which was $17.54.

CEO Compensation Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we determined that the 2018 total compensation of Gary Kain, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of $14,645,850, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above (the "CEO Compensation"), was approximately 69.7 times the total compensation of a median employee in 2018 calculated in the same manner of $210,163. 
We identified the median employee using the annual base salary and expected bonus, as of December 31, 2018, plus any long-term incentive stock awards granted in 2018 for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2018, the last day of our payroll year (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we used for determining the CEO Compensation.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the disclosure requirements of Item 405 of SEC Regulation S-K require that our directors and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of our common stock report their ownership of such equity securities and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select Market and to us. Based on a review of the written statements and copies of such reports furnished to us by our executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners, we believe that during fiscal year 2018 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors, and beneficial owners of 10% or more of our common stock were timely satisfied, except that due to an administrative error, Form 4s were filed late for each of our Section 16 officers on March 19, 2018 reporting long-term incentive awards made to the executive on March 12, 2018.

However, on all other matters properly brought before the meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof, by the Board or others, the persons named as proxies in the accompanying proxy card, or their substitutes, will vote in accordance with their discretion. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  WHAT IS A PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
It is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card. Peter J. Federico and Kenneth L. Pollack have been designated as proxies by the Board for the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  WHAT IS THE RECORD DATE AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  
[END TABLE]

  5.  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND A STOCKHOLDER WHO HOLDS STOCK IN STREET NAME?   
[END TABLE]
If your shares of common stock are registered in your name on the books and records of our transfer agent, you are a common stockholder of record. 
If your shares of common stock are held for you through an intermediary in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares are held in street name. The answer to Question 10 below describes brokers' discretionary voting authority and when your broker, bank or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares of common stock without instructions from you. For shares held through a benefit or compensation plan or a broker, bank, or other nominee, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your plan trustee, broker, bank or nominee. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person. 
It is important that you vote your shares of common stock if you are a stockholder of record and, if you hold shares in street name, that you provide appropriate voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee as discussed in the answer to Question 10 below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.  WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT I CAN USE TO VOTE MY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK?  
[END TABLE]
You may submit your proxy or vote your shares of our common stock by any of the following methods: 
By Telephone or the Internet—Common stockholders can vote their shares via telephone or the internet as instructed in the proxy card or the voting instruction form. The telephone and internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity, to allow common stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. 
By Mail—A common stockholder who receives a paper proxy card or voting instruction form or requests a paper proxy card or voting instruction form by telephone or internet may elect to vote by mail and should complete, sign and date the proxy card or voting instruction form and mail it in the pre-addressed envelope that accompanies the delivery of the proxy card or voting instruction form. For common stockholders of record, proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the date and time of the Annual Meeting. For common stockholders who hold their shares through an intermediary, such as a broker, bank, or other nominee, the voting instruction form submitted by mail must be mailed by the deadline imposed by your broker, bank, or other nominee for your shares to be voted. 
In Person—Shares of common stock held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted by you in person at the Annual Meeting. Shares of common stock held beneficially in street name may be voted by you in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a "legal" proxy from the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares and bring that "legal" proxy to the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  7.  WHO COUNTS THE VOTES?  
[END TABLE]
Our transfer agent will receive and tabulate the proxies and certify the results. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  8.  WHAT IF A STOCKHOLDER DOES NOT SPECIFY A CHOICE FOR A MATTER WHEN RETURNING A PROXY?   
[END TABLE]
Stockholders should specify their voting choice for each matter on the accompanying proxy. If no specification is made, such shares will be voted "FOR" the election of the six director nominees, "FOR" the advisory resolution on executive compensation, and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent public accountant for the year ending December 31, 2019.

  9.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE PROXY CARD?  
[END TABLE]
It means that you have multiple accounts with brokers and/or our transfer agent. Please vote all of these shares. 
We recommend that you contact your broker and/or our transfer agent to consolidate as many accounts as possible under the same name and address. Our transfer agent is Computershare Investor Services. Computershare's address is 462 South 4th St., Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202; you can reach Computershare at 1-800-733-5001 (from within the United States or Canada) or 781-575-3400 (from outside the United States or Canada). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  10.  WILL MY SHARES BE VOTED IF I DO NOT PROVIDE MY PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of Record—If you are a stockholder of record (see Question 5 above), your shares of common stock will not be voted if you do not provide your proxy unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. It is important that you vote your shares. 
Street Name Holders—If your shares of common stock are held in street name (see Question 5 above) and you do not provide your signed and dated voting instruction form to your broker, bank, or other nominee, your shares may be voted by your broker, bank, or other nominee but only under certain circumstances. Specifically, under applicable rules, shares held in the name of your broker, bank, or other nominee may be voted by your broker, bank, or other nominee on certain "routine" matters if you do not provide voting instructions. 
The only proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting that is considered a "routine" matter for which brokers, banks or other nominees may vote uninstructed shares is the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent public accountant. The other proposals (specifically, the election of director nominees and the approval of the advisory resolution on executive compensation) are not considered "routine" under applicable rules, so the broker, bank, or other nominee cannot vote your shares on these proposals unless you provide to the broker, bank, or other nominee voting instructions for these matters. If you do not provide voting instructions on a non-routine matter, your shares of common stock will not be voted on the matter, which is referred to as a "broker non-vote." It is, therefore, important that you vote your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  11.  ARE ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES COUNTED?   
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the votes at the Annual Meeting. See Question 10 above for more information about broker non-votes. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  12.  HOW CAN I REVOKE A PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board and is revocable at any time prior to the voting of the proxy, by the filing of an instrument revoking it, or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, with our Secretary, addressed to our principal executive offices at 2 Bethesda Metro Center, 12th Floor, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. In the event that you attend the Annual Meeting, you may revoke your proxy and cast your vote personally at the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  13.  WHO WILL PAY THE COST OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATION?  
[END TABLE]
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies on the accompanying form. In addition to the use of mail, our officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone or facsimile. Upon request, we will reimburse brokers, dealers, banks and trustees, or their nominees, for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding our proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock.

If you hold shares directly in your name as the stockholder of record, proof of ownership could include a copy of your account statement or a copy of your stock certificate(s).

  15.  HOW MANY VOTES MUST BE PRESENT TO HOLD THE ANNUAL MEETING?  
[END TABLE]
In order for us to conduct the Annual Meeting, holders representing a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of the close of business on the record date must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Your shares are counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you attend the meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy by internet, telephone or mail. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be considered present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. 
OTHER MATTERS
