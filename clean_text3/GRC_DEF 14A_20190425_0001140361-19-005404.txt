 PROXY STATEMENT
March 22, 2019
SOLICITATION AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to shareholders of The Gorman-Rupp Company (the "Company") in connection with the           solicitation by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders (the "Meeting") to be held at the Company's Corporate Headquarters, 600 South Airport Road,           Mansfield, Ohio, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Thursday, April 25, 2019. Holders of Common Shares of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019 are the only shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting.
A shareholder, without affecting any vote previously taken, may revoke their proxy by the execution and delivery to the           Company of a later-dated proxy with respect to the same shares, or by giving notice of revocation to the Company in writing or at the Meeting. The presence at the Meeting of the person appointing a proxy does not in and of itself revoke the           appointment.
OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING RIGHTS
As of March 4, 2019, the record date for the determination of persons entitled to vote at the Meeting, there were           26,117,045 Common Shares outstanding. Each Common Share is entitled to one vote on each proposal.
The mailing address of the principal executive office of the Company is P.O. Box 1217, Mansfield, Ohio 44901-1217. This           Proxy Statement and accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about March 22, 2019.
A quorum will be present at the Meeting if there are present, in person or by proxy, shareholders of record entitled to           exercise at least 50% of the voting power of the Company with respect to at least one of the purposes for which the Meeting was called.
With respect to the election of Directors (Proposal No. 1), the seven nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will           be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be voted for or withheld from the election of directors and thus will have no effect on the election of directors.
If notice in writing is given by any shareholder to the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of the Company, not           less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the Meeting, that such shareholder desires that the voting for the election of Directors be cumulative, and if announcement of the giving of such notice is made upon the convening of the           Meeting by the Chairman or Secretary or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving such notice, each shareholder shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as the shareholder possesses at such election. Under cumulative voting, a           shareholder controls voting power equal to the number of votes which the shareholder otherwise would have been entitled to cast multiplied by the number of Directors to be elected. All of such votes may be cast for a single nominee or may be           distributed among any two or more nominees as the shareholder may desire. If cumulative voting is invoked, and unless contrary instructions are given by a shareholder who signs a proxy, all votes represented by such proxy will be divided evenly           among the candidates nominated by the Board of Directors, except that if such voting should for any reason not be effective to elect all of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement, then such votes will be cast so as to maximize the number of           the Board of Directors' nominees elected to the Board.
With respect to the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named Executive Officers (Proposal No. 2),           and the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 3), the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is necessary to approve each such proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be voted for or           against such proposals and will not be counted in the number of votes cast on such proposals.
Brokerage firms have the authority to vote shares on certain "routine" matters when their customers do not provide voting           instructions. However, on other matters, when the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from its customers, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that matter and a "broker non-vote" occurs. Proposal No. 3 is a routine matter,           but the other proposals in this Proxy Statement are non-routine matters.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
(Proposal No. 1)
All Directors will be elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are           elected and qualified. Proxies received will be voted in the manner directed therein. If no such direction is provided, proxies received are intended to be voted in favor of fixing the number of Directors at seven and for the election of the           nominees named below. Each of the nominees, with the exception of Ms. Sonja K. McClelland, is presently a Director of the Company.
Each of the Director nominees has indicated a willingness to serve if elected.  However, in the event that any of the           nominees should become unavailable, which the Board of Directors does not anticipate, proxies are intended to be voted in favor of fixing the number of Directors at a lesser number equal to the number of available Board-designated nominees or for           the election of a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board of Directors, in the discretion of the persons appointed as proxy holders. If cumulative voting in the election of directors is invoked at a time when any of the nominees           become unavailable, unless contrary instructions are given by a shareholder who signs a proxy, all votes represented by such proxy will be divided evenly among the available candidates nominated by the Board, except that, the proxies may be voted           cumulatively for less than the entire number of candidates nominated by the Board if any situation arises which, in the opinion of the proxy holders, makes such action necessary or desirable.
On January 23, 2019, James C. Gorman and W. Wayne Walston each notified the Company of their intent not to stand for           re-election as Directors at the Meeting, at which time their respective terms as Directors will expire.

The Compensation Committee is charged with oversight and periodic review of Non-Employee Director compensation and with           recommending any changes to the entire Board of Directors. Directors who are employees of the Company (Messrs. J. C. Gorman and J. S. Gorman) do not receive any compensation for service as Directors.  Non-Employee Directors are compensated by the           Company for their services as Directors through a combination of annual cash retainers and stock awards.
The Company's Non-Employee Directors compensation for 2018 consisted of annual cash retainers of $53,000 each and stock awards of           1,500 shares each effective as of July 2, 2018.  To reflect their additional responsibilities, Chairs of the Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee received an additional retainer fee of $4,000, and the Chair of the Audit           Committee received an additional retainer fee of $8,000.  The Lead Independent Director received an additional retainer fee of $5,000.
The Company has a stock ownership guidelines policy for its Non-Employee Directors to encourage meaningful stock ownership in the           Company.  The policy requires each Non-Employee Director to own shares of stock equal in value to five times his or her annual cash retainer, and prohibits most sales of shares unless the applicable minimum stock ownership requirement is met.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board of Directors and Board Committees
The Company requires that a majority of its Directors must be "independent" as required by the listing standards of the NYSE and           SEC rules, or by other regulatory or legislative bodies as may be applicable to the Company. The Board, on an annual basis, makes a determination as to the independence of each Director in accordance with applicable listing standards, rules and           regulations. In general, "independent" means that a Director has no "material relationship" with the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than through his or her service as a Director. The existence of a material relationship must be           determined based upon a review of all relevant facts and circumstances, and generally is a relationship that might reasonably be expected to compromise the Director's ability to maintain his or her independence from management in connection with           the Director's duties.
The Board has approved Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Ethics to provide guidance for the governance of the Company.            The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for monitoring these guidelines and code of ethics and reviews them on an annual basis and, subject to Board approval, makes such revisions as may be necessary or appropriate to reflect new           regulatory requirements and evolving corporate governance practices. The Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics are available in their entirety on the Company's website at http://www.gormanrupp.com.
Based on an annual review by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Committee affirmatively determined, after considering all           relevant facts and circumstances known to it, that no Non-Employee Director has a material relationship with the Company and that all Non-Employee Directors meet the independence standards of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well           as the current independence standards of the NYSE and SEC corporate governance requirements for listed companies, and have no relationships or transactions required to be reported by Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
During 2018, a total of 5 regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors (at least one each quarter) and a total of 16           meetings of all standing Directors' Committees were held. All Directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings held by the Board of Directors and the respective Committees on which they served. In 2018, the "independent"           Directors met at every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors in executive session without the presence of the non-independent Directors and any members of the Company's management. The Lead Independent Director, who is currently           M. Ann Harlan, generally presides at these non-management executive sessions  Members of the Board of Directors are expected to attend the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and all Directors were in attendance at the Annual Meeting in           2018.
 At the April 26, 2018 annual reorganizational meeting of the Board of Directors, M. Ann Harlan was re-elected by the independent           Directors as Lead Independent Director, to serve for an additional one year term. The Lead Independent Director is responsible for coordinating the activities of the other independent Directors and has the authority to preside at all meetings of           the Board of Directors at which the Chairman of the Board is not present. The Lead Independent Director serves as principal liaison on Board-wide issues between the independent Directors and the Chairman of the Board, approves meeting schedules           and agendas and monitors the quality of information sent to the Board. The Lead Independent Director also may recommend the retention of outside advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board of Directors. If requested by shareholders,           when appropriate, the Lead Independent Director also will be available for consultation and direct communication.
The Board completes annual performance evaluations of the Board, as well as the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and           the Governance and Nominating Committee, to assist in determining whether the Board and its Committees are functioning effectively.  Annually, the Board and each of its Committees complete self-evaluations and review and discuss the results.  The           Governance and Nominating Committee oversees this process.
The Board of Directors has three separately designated standing Committees: (1) Audit Committee; (2) Compensation Committee; and           (3) Governance and Nominating Committee. All members of each Committee are independent Directors. Each Committee is governed by a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors detailing its authority and responsibilities. These charters are           reviewed and updated periodically as legislative and regulatory developments and business circumstances warrant. Complete copies of each Committee charter are available on the Company's website at http://www.gormanrupp.com. The table below shows current members of each of the Committees and the number of meetings held by each standing Committee in 2018.

A more comprehensive description of the Compensation Committee's functions regarding the consideration and determination of officer           compensation is set forth under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Governance and Nominating Committee
The principal functions of the Governance and Nominating Committee include the authority and responsibility to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Identify, evaluate and recommend individuals for nomination as members of the Board of Directors;  
● Develop a succession plan for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other Executive Officers;

● Periodically review the Board Committees' charters and the Corporate Governance Guidelines for compliance with evolving regulations and Board-desired corporate goals; and  
● Monitor the availability of training and professional education programs suitable for Directors for enhancement of their Board and Committee responsibilities.  
[END TABLE]
 The Governance and Nominating Committee charter incorporates the Company's policies and procedures by which to consider           recommendations from shareholders for Director nominees. Any shareholder wishing to propose a candidate may do so by delivering a typewritten or legible hand-written communication to the Company's Corporate Secretary. The submission should           provide detailed business and personal biographical data about the candidate, and include a brief analysis explaining why the individual is well-qualified to become a Director nominee. All recommendations will be acknowledged by the Corporate           Secretary and promptly referred to the Governance and Nominating Committee for evaluation.
The Governance and Nominating Committee has not specified any particular set of skills, qualities or diversities that is required           for a Director candidate. All Director candidates, including any recommended by shareholders, are first evaluated based upon their (i) integrity, strength of character, practical wisdom and mature judgment; (ii) business and financial expertise           and experience; (iii) intellect to comprehend the issues confronting the Company; and (iv) availability of adequate time to devote to the affairs of the Company and attend Board and Committee meetings. The Governance and Nominating Committee also           focuses on issues of diversity, such as diversity of gender, race and national origin, education, professional experience and differences in viewpoints and skills. New Director candidates are subject to a background check performed by the           Governance and Nominating Committee. In addition, the candidate will be personally interviewed by one or more Governance and Nominating Committee members before he or she is nominated for election to the Board of Directors. In considering           candidates for the Board, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials in the context of their skills, qualities or diversities. With respect to the nomination of continuing Directors for           re-election, the individual's historical contributions to the Board are also considered. Third-party search firms may be retained by the Board to identify individuals that meet the director candidate criteria established by the Governance and           Nominating Committee. Ms. McClelland was identified and preliminarily evaluated by a third-party search firm retained by the Board.
Risk Oversight
The Board of Directors believes that control and management of risk are primary responsibilities of senior management of the           Company. As a general matter, the entire Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of this important senior management function. The Audit Committee is responsible to the Board for the organizational oversight of the Company's comprehensive           enterprise risk management plan. Additional oversight of some functional risks is performed by specific Board Committees, e.g., financial reporting risks are overseen by the Audit Committee; personnel selection, evaluation, retention and           compensation risks and benefit plan investment risks are overseen by the Compensation Committee; and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Officer, other corporate officer, key operating executive and Director succession planning risks are overseen           by the Governance and Nominating Committee. The results of each Committee's oversight are reported regularly to the entire Board of Directors.
Company Leadership Organization
With respect to the roles of Board Chairman and Chief             Executive Officer, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the roles may be separated or combined, and the Board exercises its discretion in combining or separating these positions as it deems appropriate in light of prevailing             circumstances.  Upon election of Mr. J.S. Gorman as Chief Executive Officer of the Company on May 1, 1998, the Company separated the offices of Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer because it believed this division more clearly           delineated their respective responsibilities. This separation currently provides for the Chairman to focus on Board of Director responsibilities and for the Chief Executive Officer to focus on the Company's executive, administrative and operating           responsibilities. Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board believes that the combination or separation of these offices should continue to be             considered as part of the succession planning process.
Related Party Transactions
The Company has no relationships or transactions             required to be reported by Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Although the Company does not have a specific written policy regarding review, approval or ratification of related party transactions, the Company has a formal annual review process for             such transactions at all locations, and the Board of Directors has the authority to review and approve all related party transactions defined as those transactions required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Review and approval             of related party transactions also would be evidenced through the Company's Code of Ethics compliance, annual completion of the Company's Directors & Officers Questionnaires and discussion at Board meetings, or addressed in unanimous             written actions in lieu of a Board meeting, if applicable.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the Company's officer compensation program and how it applies to the Company's           Chief Executive Officer and its other officers (collectively, the "Officers"), including its four named executive officers ("Executive Officers") identified in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.
Overview
The Gorman-Rupp Company has a long and continuing focus on building profitability and consistently delivering increased value to           our shareholders. To accomplish this goal, the Company's Officer compensation program is designed to encourage and reward leadership, initiative, teamwork and top-quality performances among the Officers.
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors is authorized to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Review and evaluate the compensation policies and programs for the Officers;  
● Review, at least annually, the Chief Executive Officer's progress assessments of the other Officers and to evaluate the Chief Executive Officer's progress assessment;  
● Review and recommend the annual salaries, profit sharing and long-term incentive compensation determinations for the Executive Officers to the Board of Directors; and  
● Review the compensation of Non-Employee Directors ("Directors") and submit any suggested recommendations for changes to the Directors for review.  
[END TABLE]
Four independent Directors comprise the Committee. Their responsibilities are carried out pursuant to authority delegated by the           Board of Directors and in accordance with the federal securities laws and other applicable laws and regulations and the Committee's charter.
Philosophy and Objectives
Under the Committee's oversight, the Company has formulated a compensation philosophy that is intended to assure the provision of           fair, competitive and performance-based compensation to the Officers. This philosophy reflects the belief that compensation of the Officers should be consistent with the Company's historical compensation practices, its culture, its profitability           and its long-term shareholder value.
The implementation of the Company's Officer compensation philosophy seeks (i) to attract and retain a group of talented individuals           with the education, experience, skill sets and professional presence deemed best suited for the respective Officer positions; and (ii) to continually motivate those individuals to help the Company achieve its strategic goals and enhance           profitability by offering them incentive compensation in the form of profit sharing and equity-based compensation awards driven by the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
Elements of Compensation
The Company's Officer compensation program consists of four elements: base salary, profit sharing, performance-based share awards           and a component of modest miscellaneous benefits. The Company has not entered into employment contracts with any of the Officers.
Ownership of the Company's Common Shares by the Officers has continually been considered a worthy goal within the Company to           further align Officers' interests with those of Shareholders. Toward that end, the Company sponsors opportunities to purchase Common Shares, including a partial Company match, aimed at encouraging the Officers, and substantially all other           employees, to voluntarily invest in the Common Shares.
The Company has a stock ownership guidelines policy which establishes minimum stock ownership requirements for its Officers, group           presidents and other corporate and operating officers to encourage meaningful stock ownership in the Company.  The policy requires each executive, operating president and designated key employees to own shares of stock equal in value ranging from           multiples of one times to three times his or her base salary, and prohibits most sales of shares unless the applicable minimum stock ownership requirement is met. Base Salary and Profit Sharing — Base                      salaries are premised upon the relative responsibilities of the given Officers and industry surveys and related data. Initial salaries generally are set below competitive levels paid to comparable officers at other entities engaged in the same or           similar businesses as the Company based upon Equilar peer data, discussed below under "Annual Review", and Company philosophy. Subsequently, actual salaries are adjusted periodically based on judgments of each person's performance,           qualifications, accomplishments and expected future contributions in his or her Officer role.
The Company intentionally relies to a significant degree on incentive compensation in the form of profit sharing to attract and           retain the Officers. This profit sharing opportunity provides motivation for them to perform to the full extent of their individual abilities and as a team to build total Company profitability and shareholder value on a continuing, long-term           basis.
Performance-Based Share Awards — Pursuant                      to The Gorman-Rupp Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"), long-term equity incentive compensation is an element of compensation used to enhance the Company's compensation program in combination with its succession planning           for key personnel and to further align the interests of award recipients with shareholders. Equity incentive compensation has also been selected to facilitate the accumulation of additional Company shares of stock by those most accountable for           the Company's operating results and shareholder value. Equity awards are typically conditioned upon achievement of appropriate performance metrics, however the Compensation Committee may from time to time grant service-based awards or           unrestricted shares to certain employees. Recipients of grants of performance-based shares receive a target award of performance-based shares that vest at the end of a three year performance period, based on the levels of achievement of the           performance goals established by the Compensation Committee, which may range from 0% to 150% of the target number of performance-based shares. The performance goals for these performance-based shares are based on targeted adjusted operating           income growth and adjusted shareholders' equity growth, weighted 50% each. The Committee believes the combination of these performance goals selected for the Incentive Plan provides an appropriate balance between earnings-related and growth goals           while also focusing on shareholder value growth. Each vested performance-based share represents the right to receive one Common Share of the Company.
In determining the target amount of performance-based shares to be granted to our Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee           takes into account several factors, including our Chief Executive Officer's recommendation for the other Executive Officers, our short-term and long-term financial and strategic objectives, the Executive Officer's relative job scope, individual           performance history and prior and anticipated future contributions to the Company. After considering these factors, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of performance-based shares to be granted at levels it considers appropriate to           create a meaningful opportunity for reward predicated on the creation of long-term stockholder value.
Under certain circumstances, including a restatement of financial results by the Company, the grantee may be required to return to           the Company performance shares and/or pretax income derived from any disposition of shares previously received if the performance shares would not have been earned based upon the restated financial results.
The three-year performance period for performance-based shares granted to the Officers in 2016 concluded on December 31, 2018.  The           performance goals for the 2016-2018 performance period were based on targets for compound annual growth for adjusted operating income and adjusted shareholders' equity, weighted 50% each.  At the end of the performance period, the minimum           threshold for adjusted operating income growth was met, but the minimum threshold for adjusted shareholders' equity growth was not met.  Accordingly, performance-based shares were awarded to the Officers at 25% of the target under the 2016           grants.
Other Compensation — The           Officers receive a variety of miscellaneous benefits, the value of which is represented for the named Executive Officers under the caption "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table. These benefits include taxable life insurance,           and Company contributions to the Christmas Savings Plan, the 401(k) Plan, and certain partial matching contribution opportunities under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company also sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in which two of the           Company's Executive Officers participate as explained under the caption "Pension Benefits."
Stock Ownership — The           Company has long encouraged the Officers to voluntarily invest in the Company's Common Shares. As a consequence, the Company makes the purchase of its Common Shares convenient, in some cases with partial cash matching contributions from the           Company, and in all cases without brokers' fees or commissions, under an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan and a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Although the purchase opportunities available through these plans do not constitute elements of           Officer compensation, all of the current Officers are shareholders and participate in one or more of the foregoing plans. Directors, Officers and certain other employees may not engage in hedging transactions related to the Company's securities, may not           engage in short sales, may not purchase or sell put options, call options or other such derivative securities, and may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan.
Annual Reviews
In devising and maintaining the Company's Executive Officer compensation program, the Committee requests management to periodically           provide data relevant to the compensation paid to officers holding equivalent positions or having similar responsibilities in a group of industrial peers. Such information is obtained from Equilar, a leading independent third-party provider of           financial, executive and director compensation data, for their review. Equilar was used by the Company to obtain competitive compensation information from public proxy data for management and the Committee as a general reference to low, mean,           median and high compensation ranges and for correlation to similar measures of operating profitability and total shareholder return. The Committee's current objective is for the Company's Executive Officers to be compensated at a total level of           compensation commensurate with at least the 25th percentile of compensation of comparable capital goods manufacturing companies.
The Committee additionally evaluates the Executive Officers' progress assessments and the Company's financial performance in           performing its compensation review responsibilities. The Committee also takes into account the outcome of prior shareholders' advisory votes on executive compensation. The Committee regularly consults with executive management and has the           authority if needed to consult with outside accounting, legal and compensation advisors as appropriate in arriving at compensation recommendations, subject to approval by the Board of Directors.
Prior to the Company's July Board meeting, the Committee reviews with the Chief Executive Officer the recommended annual base           salary for each of the Executive Officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer). The Committee independently reviews the base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and develops a recommendation therefor. These salary reviews include           consideration of the fact that a significant component of total compensation is variable, performance-based profit sharing. The Committee then reports the results of its Executive Officer compensation reviews and recommendations to the Board of           Directors.
During July 2018, the Committee reviewed updated Equilar-provided peer information compensation details from 15 other capital goods           manufacturing companies listed below, which peer group is unchanged from that used in 2017.

[END TABLE]
These peer companies reflect similar size, with median revenue of approximately $515 million and annual revenue ranging from           approximately $100 million to $1 billion, with The Gorman-Rupp Company ranking in the 33rd percentile in annual revenue.  The Committee also took into account the           favorable outcome of the shareholders' advisory vote on executive compensation at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board, based on the Committee's recommendations, approved base salary increases for Executive Officers           reflecting the Board's assessment of all the factors described above.
Following the end of each year and the final preparation of the Company's audited financial statements, management calculates the           total amount of profit sharing available for awarding to the Executive Officers based on the Company's achieved operating income and the award percentage determined at the beginning of the year. The Chief Executive Officer then determines a           recommended allocation of the available profit sharing award pool among the Executive Officers based on the respective Executive Officer's prior profit sharing award history and their current year progress assessment. The Committee reviews with the Chief Executive Officer the recommended profit sharing award for each of the Executive Officers           (other than the Chief Executive Officer). The Committee independently reviews the profit sharing award for the Chief Executive Officer and develops a recommendation therefor. These profit sharing reviews include consideration of the Chief           Executive Officer's progress assessments of the other Officers, and the Committee's independent progress assessment of the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's prior profit sharing award history. The Committee then reports the results of its           profit sharing reviews and recommendations for the Executive Officers to the Board of Directors for its consideration and approval.
During 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved grants of performance-based shares for           the Company's Executive Officers as follows: Jeffrey S. Gorman —7,280  performance-based Common Shares; James C. Kerr — 5,460 performance-based Common Shares; and Brigette A. Burnell — 3,640 performance-based Common Shares. At the time of the           2018 grant, the Compensation Committee recognized that achievement of the three-year performance goals were expected to be very challenging, requiring significant growth from 2017 levels.  The granted shares also may vest to a certain extent in           the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Incentive Plan) of the Company or the death, disability or retirement of the grantee.

 (3)   The amounts reflect the non-cash change in pension value recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended                    December 31, 2018, in accordance with SEC Release Nos. 33-8732A; 34-54302A. In computing the change in pension value, the Company applies the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes and a measurement date of December 31 for                    benefit plan determinations. The change in pension value is the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the respective Executive Officer's accumulated benefit measured on an annual basis from the plan measurement date in 2016                    to the measurement date in 2018. Decreases of $17,719, $15,414 and $22,727 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are excluded from James C. Gorman's data per the table's guidance. The Company does not offer nonqualified deferred                    compensation earnings to any of its employees.

 (1)   These amounts reflect the threshold, target and maximum number of performance-based shares granted on February 22, 2018 under The Gorman-Rupp                    Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. These shares vest on December 31, 2020 based upon the achievement of pre-determined financial performance goals for adjusted operating income growth and adjusted shareholders' equity growth over a                    three-year performance period ending December 31, 2020.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)   The value of performance-based shares is calculated assuming achievement of the target level of performance based on the closing market value of                    the Company's Common Shares on the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  
[END TABLE]

 (3)   Except for certain limited circumstances as set forth in the Incentive Plan (such as death or a Change in Control), all performance-based shares                    granted under the Incentive Plan vest at the end of a three year performance period, and the amount vested and paid is based on the levels of achievement of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The two performance                    goals established for the January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 performance period are specific ranges of adjusted operating income growth and adjusted shareholders' equity growth, weighted 50% each. The range of future payouts is 0%                    to 150% for each performance goal, with the threshold payout occurring at 50%, the target payout occurring at 100% and the maximum payout occurring at 150%. Grantees under the Incentive Plan do not have any of the rights of a shareholder                    with respect to any shares granted, including the right to vote or receive dividends, until determination of the achievement of the performance goals and payment of the applicable shares in accordance with the Incentive Plan.

 (4)   Represents 2016 grants.  These performance-based shares were scheduled to vest following conclusion of the relevant performance period on                    December 31, 2018 based upon the achievement of pre-determined performance goals. The number and value of the shares reflected in the table are based on achievement of the minimum threshold level of performance with respect to one of the                    two performance goals. On February 27, 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's financial results for the period ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the performance goals, and determined that the minimum threshold for                    adjusted operating income growth was met, but the minimum threshold for adjusted shareholders' equity growth was not met.  Accordingly, performance shares vested at 25% of the target under the 2016 grants and the remaining portion of such                    grants did not vest and were forfeited.  
[END TABLE]
 The estimated value of the aggregate number of performance shares that would have become payable to each of the Company's Executive           Officers in the event of a Change of Control followed by a qualifying termination of the Executive Officer's employment on December 31, 2018 are as follows: Jeffrey S. Gorman — $696,815; James C. Kerr — $333,369; and Brigette A. Burnell —           $348,408.
The estimated value of the aggregate number of performance shares that would have become payable to each of the Company's Executive           Officers in the event of death on December 31, 2018 are as follows: Jeffrey S. Gorman — $469,999; James C. Kerr — $163,260; and Brigette A. Burnell — $235,005.
The estimated value of the aggregated number of performance shares that would have become payable to each of the Company's           Executive Officers on December 31, 2018 in the event of the Executive Officer's retirement or termination due to disability on such date are as follows: Jeffrey S. Gorman — $63,070; and Brigette A. Burnell — $31,535.  These estimated values are           based on the attainment of 25% of the performance targets under the 2016 grants.
Pension Benefits
The pension plan in which two of the Company's Executive Officers participate is a defined benefit plan covering certain           U.S. employees of the Company. New entry into this plan terminated as of December 31, 2007 and, effective January 1, 2008, an enhanced 401(k) Plan benefit was adopted for new employees hired thereafter.
The pension plan offers participants upon retirement the option to choose between monthly benefits or a single lump sum payment.           The monthly pension benefits are equal to the product of 1.1% of the participant's final average monthly earnings (based on compensation during the final ten years of service) and the number of years of credited service. A single lump sum amount           is equal to the present value of the final monthly pension benefit multiplied by a single premium immediate annuity rate as defined by the plan. Historically, nearly all participants in the plan elect the single lump sum amount at retirement. The           single lump sum payment option is used for financial reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, computed as of the plan measurement date of December 31, 2018.
Actuarial assumptions used by the Company in determining the present value of the accumulated benefit amount consist of a 2.25%           interest rate for 2018-2020 with a 4.0% interest rate thereafter, a 3.27% discount rate and the RP-2014 Mortality Table adjusted to Scale MP-2017 with Generational Projection (Scale MP-2018). Base compensation in excess of $275,000 is not taken           into account under the plan. Vesting occurs after five years of credited service.
Pension Benefits Table
The table below summarizes the number of years of credited service and the present value of accumulated pension benefit for the two           Executive Officers of the Company who participated in the pension plan for calendar years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Company believes its executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to           perform in ways that enhance shareholder value and demonstrate a commitment to internal pay equity.  The Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our Executive Officers and the pay of our non-executive employees. The           Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation in 2018 to the median of the annual total compensation of all other Company employees for the same period.  The annual total compensation for 2018 of the           Company's CEO was $1,093,794 and for the median employee was $55,892. The Company's reasonable estimate, prepared based on applicable SEC rules, of the resulting ratio of the Company's CEO's pay to the pay of its median employee for 2018 was 19.6           to 1.
The Company identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO,           who were employed by us on December 31, 2018.  The calculation included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. The Company did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash           compensation, and did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by the Company for all of 2018. The Company believes the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied           compensation measure because it does not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. Less than two percent of the Company's employees receive annual equity awards.
After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, the Company calculated annual total compensation for such           employee using the same methodology used for the CEO as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
(Proposal No. 2)
This proposal is for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named Executive Officers pursuant to           Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named Executive Officers and the compensation philosophy, policies           and practices as described in the Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis narrative discussion, Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and narrative disclosure included in this Proxy Statement. As detailed           therein, the Directors are focused on compensating the Executive Officers fairly and in a manner that promotes the Company's compensation philosophy that compensation of the Executive Officers should be aligned with the Company's historical           compensation, its culture, and its profitability for the continued achievement of long-term shareholder value. Accordingly, the Company is asking shareholders to vote "FOR" the adoption of the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of The Gorman-Rupp Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named           Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis narrative discussion, Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and narrative disclosure included in the Company's 2019 Proxy           Statement."
While not binding on the Company, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, the results of shareholder voting on this           proposal will be considered by the Board and Compensation Committee when making future compensation decisions for the Company's named Executive Officers.

Representatives of           Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees paid to Auditors
The Company paid Ernst & Young LLP the following fees in connection with the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and           2017:

 (1)   Audit fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements                    and the reviews of the Company's interim financial statements included in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, or services that are normally provided by the accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements                    for those fiscal years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)   Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the                    audit or review of the Company's financial statements and are not reported under the caption "Audit Fees." The audit-related fees paid were primarily for financial reporting and other advisory services.

[END TABLE]

Under its charter, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the oversight of the work of Ernst & Young LLP and has the           sole authority to (i) appoint, retain and terminate Ernst & Young LLP, (ii) pre-approve all audit engagement fees, terms and services, and (iii) pre-approve scope and fees for any non-audit engagements with Ernst & Young LLP. The           Committee exercises this authority in a manner consistent with applicable law and the rules of the SEC and the NYSE, and Ernst & Young LLP reports directly to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has determined to delegate           its authority to grant any pre-approvals to its Chairman, subject to the report of any such pre-approvals to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting for ratification. Further, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the auditing           firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee is directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young LLP's new lead engagement partner.  In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by the           Company's independent registered public accounting firm in 2018.
Ratification by the shareholders of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is not required by law. However, the Board of           Directors believes that shareholders should be given this opportunity to express their views on the subject. While not binding on the Audit Committee, the failure of the shareholders to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the           Company's independent registered public accountants would be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to continue the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its           discretion, select a different firm of independent registered public accountants for the Company at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
