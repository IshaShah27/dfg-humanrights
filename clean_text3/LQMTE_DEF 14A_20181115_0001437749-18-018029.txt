VOTING RIGHTS AND SOLICITATION
Voting Your Shares and Revocation of Proxies
You may vote by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person or you may vote by submitting a proxy.
The method of voting by proxy differs (1) depending on whether you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet or receiving a paper copy, and (2) for shares held as a record holder and shares held in "street name." If you hold your shares of stock as a record holder and you are viewing this proxy statement on the Internet, you may vote by submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the website referred to in the Notice previously mailed to you. If you hold your shares of stock as a record holder and you are reviewing a paper copy of this proxy statement, you may vote your shares by completing, dating and signing the proxy card that was included with the proxy statement and promptly returning it in the preaddressed, postage paid envelope provided to you, or by submitting a proxy over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card. If you hold your shares of stock in "street name," which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you will receive a notice from your broker, bank or other nominee that includes instructions on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or nominee will allow you to deliver your voting instructions over the Internet and may also permit you to vote by telephone. In addition, you may request paper copies of the proxy statement and proxy card from your broker by following the instructions on the notice provided by your broker.
The Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. eastern time on November, 14, 2018. If you vote through the Internet, you should be aware that you may incur costs to access the Internet, such as usage charges from telephone companies or Internet service providers and that these costs must be borne by you. If you vote by Internet or telephone, then you need not return a written proxy card by mail.
Your vote is very important.  You should submit your proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting.
All shares held by stockholders who are entitled to vote and who are represented at the Annual Meeting by properly submitted proxies received before the polls are closed at the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxy card, unless such proxy is properly revoked prior to the vote being taken on the matter submitted to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
A proxy may be revoked and your vote changed in advance of the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you can change your vote and revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting by doing any one of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• filing with our Corporate Secretary, at or before the taking of the vote, a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• duly executing a later dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate Secretary before the taking of the vote;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accessing the Internet and following the instructions for voting by Internet that appear on the enclosed proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• following the instructions that appear on the enclosed proxy card for voting by telephone; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting, if a stockholder does not vote, will not be sufficient to revoke a proxy.  
[END TABLE]
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent to us at the following address: Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 20321 Valencia Circle, Lake Forest, California 92630. If your shares are held in "street name," which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke a previously given proxy.
If a proxy card does not specify how the proxy is to be voted, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted "FOR" the election of each of the six nominees for director named in the accompanying proxy statement, "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers, and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of SingerLewak LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the year ending December 31, 2018.
The form of proxy accompanying this proxy statement confers discretionary authority upon the named proxy holders with respect to amendments or variations to the matters identified in the accompanying notice of Annual Meeting and with respect to any other matters which may properly come before the Annual Meeting. Our board of directors does not know of any other matters that may come before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter properly comes before the Annual Meeting, including consideration of a motion to adjourn the Annual Meeting to another time or place (including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies), the persons named in the proxy card that accompanies this proxy statement will exercise their judgment in deciding how to vote, or otherwise act, at the Annual Meeting with respect to that matter or proposal.
If you receive more than one proxy card, it means you hold shares that are registered in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, sign and return each proxy card or, if you submit a proxy by telephone or the Internet, submit one proxy for each proxy card you receive.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting
Only our stockholders as of the record date for the Annual Meeting, their proxy holders, and guests we may invite may attend the Annual Meeting. If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting in person but you hold your shares through someone else, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring proof of your ownership and photo identification to the Annual Meeting. For example, you could bring an account statement showing that you beneficially owned shares of our stock as of the record date as acceptable proof of ownership. You must also contact your broker, bank or other nominee and follow their instructions in order to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. You may not vote your shares at the Annual Meeting unless you have first followed the procedures outlined by your broker, bank or other nominee.
Stockholders Entitled to Vote and Number of Votes
The record date for the Annual Meeting is September 21, 2018. Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting.  As of the record date, there were 909,972,342 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. A list of stockholders eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection at the Annual Meeting, and at our executive offices during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten days prior to the Annual Meeting.
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all proposals at the Annual Meeting.  
Quorum and Votes Required
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will also determine whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business.  Our bylaws provide that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business.  Abstentions will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.  If a broker indicates on its proxy that it does not have discretionary voting authority to vote shares for which it is the holder of record at the Annual Meeting, such shares cannot be voted by the broker (a "broker non-vote"), although they will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present.  Brokers or other nominees who hold shares in "street name" for the beneficial owner of those shares typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner. However, brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the election of directors or other "non-routine" proposals without specific instructions from the beneficial owner.  Only Proposal 4 is considered to be a "routine" proposal for the purposes of brokers exercising their voting discretion.
Proposal 1 – Election of Directors. Pursuant to our bylaws and Delaware law, if a quorum exists, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election. Neither broker non-votes nor abstentions will be included in the tabulation of the voting results for this proposal.
Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote on Compensation of Named Executive Officers. Approval (on a non-binding, advisory basis) of the compensation of our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this matter. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against this proposal, but broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal.
Because this vote is advisory, the results of the vote are not binding on our board of directors or our Compensation Committee. However, if there is a significant vote against the compensation of our named executive officers, our board of directors and our Compensation Committee will carefully evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Proposal 3 – Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on Compensation of Named Executive Officers. With respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers, the frequency option (one year, two years or three years), if any, that receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this matter will be considered the frequency option preferred by our stockholders, although such vote will not be binding on us. Our board of directors recommends that you vote in favor of holding an advisory vote every three years. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against this proposal, but broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results for this proposal.
Proposal 4 - Ratification of Accountants. Ratification of SingerLewak LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the year ending December 31, 2018 will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this matter. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against this proposal. The ratification of accountants is a routine proposal on which a broker or other nominee is generally empowered to vote in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner, so broker non-votes are unlikely to result from this proposal.
Other Matters. In order to be approved, any other matter to properly come before the Annual Meeting will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.
Solicitation of Proxies
Proxies solicited by this proxy statement may be exercised only at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment of the Annual Meeting and will not be used for any other meeting.  Proxies solicited by this proxy statement will be returned to our Secretary and will be tabulated by an inspector of elections designated by our board of directors who will not be employed by us.
We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies by mail on behalf of the board of directors.  Proxies also may be solicited by personal interview or by telephone by our directors, officers, and other employees without additional compensation.  We also have made arrangements with brokerage firms, banks, nominees, and other fiduciaries to forward proxy solicitation materials for shares held of record to the beneficial owners of such shares.  We will reimburse such record holders for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
At the Annual Meeting, six directors are to be elected, each to serve a one-year term expiring at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is elected and qualified.
Our board of directors has nominated for election Professor Lugee Li ("Professor Li"), Abdi Mahamedi, Walter Weyler, Vincent Carrubba, Tony Chung and Isaac Bresnick. Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected, and our board of directors has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unavailable or will decline to serve. In the event, however, that any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons designated as proxies will vote for any nominee who is designated by our current board of directors to fill the vacancy.
For each person nominated to become a director there follows information given by each concerning his principal occupation and business experience for at least the past five years, the names of other public reporting companies for which he serves, or has during the past five years served, as a director, and his age and length of service as one of our directors. In addition, for each person nominated to become a director, there follows information regarding the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the conclusion (by our board of directors) that the person should serve as a director. There are no family relationships among any of our directors and executive officers. No director or executive officer is related by blood, marriage or adoption to any other director or executive officer. No arrangements or understandings exist between any director or person nominated for election as a director and any other person pursuant to which such person is to be selected as a director or nominee for election as a director except with respect to Professor Li as noted below.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Board Meetings and Director Independence
During 2017, our board of directors held 5 meetings. All directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the board of directors and the committees on which they served during 2017. In addition, the independent directors met in executive session periodically in 2017.
We have not established a policy with regard to the attendance of board members at annual stockholder meetings. 
Our board of directors presently has six members, and biographical information regarding these directors (all of whom are director nominees) is set forth above under the caption "PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS."

The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation of our senior management, including salaries, bonuses, termination arrangements and other executive officer benefits. The Compensation Committee also administers our equity incentive plans.

A copy of the Compensation Committee's charter is posted on the Company's website at www.liquidmetal.com in the "Investors" section of the website.

Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.

During 2017, the Governance Committee held 1 meeting. The Governance Committee is governed by a written charter approved by our board of directors. A copy of the Governance Committee's charter is posted on the Company's website at www.liquidmetal.com in the "Investors" section of the website.
In identifying potential independent board of directors candidates with significant senior-level professional experience, the Governance Committee solicits candidates from the board of directors, senior management and others and may engage a search firm in the process. The Governance Committee reviews and narrows the list of candidates and interviews potential nominees. The final candidate is also introduced and interviewed by the board of directors and the lead director if one has been appointed.
In general, in considering whether to recommend any particular candidate for inclusion in our board of directors' slate of recommended director nominees, the Governance Committee will apply the criteria set forth in our corporate governance guidelines. These criteria include the candidate's integrity, business acumen, commitment to understanding our business and industry, experience, conflicts of interest and the ability to act in the interests of our stockholders. Further, specific consideration is given to, among other things, diversity of background and experience that a candidate would bring to our board of directors. The Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is a prerequisite for each prospective nominee. We believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of our directors, considered as a group, should provide a composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow our board of directors to fulfill its responsibilities.
Stockholders may recommend individuals to the Governance Committee for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting their names, together with appropriate biographical information and background materials to our Governance Committee at the following address: Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 20321 Valencia Circle, Lake Forest, California 92630. Assuming that appropriate biographical and background material has been provided on a timely basis, the Governance Committee will evaluate stockholder recommended candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for candidates submitted by others.
Audit Committee. We have a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Mr. Weyler serves as the chairman, and Mr. Mahamedi and Mr. Carrubba serve as the other members of, the Audit Committee. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Weyler, Mr. Mahamedi and Mr. Carrubba are all "independent directors" as defined by the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. applicable to members of an audit committee and Rule 10A-3(b)(i) under the Exchange Act. Our board of directors has not deemed any members of the current Audit Committee to be qualified as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K or demonstrate "financial sophistication" as defined by the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Following the departure of the previous Audit Committee Chairman on March 28, 2016, the Company is in the process of identifying a "new audit committee financial expert" and will make an appointment once a suitable individual is identified. The Audit Committee is appointed by our board of directors to assist our board of directors in monitoring (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and (3) the independence and performance of our internal and external auditors.
The Audit Committee's principal functions include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing our annual audited financial statements with management and our independent auditors, including major issues regarding accounting and auditing principles and practices and financial reporting that could significantly affect our financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing our quarterly financial statements with management and our independent auditor prior to the filing of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including the results of the independent auditors' reviews of the quarterly financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommending to the board of directors the appointment of, and continued evaluation of the performance of, our independent auditor;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving the fees to be paid to our independent auditor for audit services and approving the retention of our independent auditor for non-audit services and all fees for such services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing periodic reports from our independent auditor regarding our auditor's independence, including discussion of such reports with the auditor;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing significant reports to management prepared by our internal auditing department and management's responses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing the adequacy of our overall control environment, including internal financial controls and disclosure controls and procedures; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing with our management and legal counsel legal matters that may have a material impact on our financial statements or our compliance policies and any material reports or inquiries received from regulators or governmental agencies.  
[END TABLE]
During 2017, the Audit Committee met 6 times. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter approved by our board of directors. A copy of the Audit Committee's charter is posted on the Company's website at www.liquidmetal.com in the "Investors" section of the website.
Code of Ethics
Our board of directors has adopted a written Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial and Accounting Officers that applies to our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or Controller or persons performing similar functions. We have posted a current copy of the code on our website, www.liquidmetal.com, in the "Investors" section of the website. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial and Accounting Officers.
Leadership and Risk Oversight
Our board of directors as a whole has oversight responsibility for our risk management process. This risk oversight function is carried out both by our full board of directors and by individual committees that are tasked by our board of directors with oversight of specific risks. The Audit Committee oversees risks associated with financial and accounting matters including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and our financial reporting and internal control systems. The Compensation Committee evaluates risks associated with our compensation policies and practices so as not to encourage or reward excessive risk-taking by our executives or employees.
On a regular basis our board of directors receives information and reports from committees, senior management and/or outside counsel and consultants and discusses the identification, assessment, management and mitigation of the risks associated with our strategic and business plans and operations. Our board of directors also holds regular sessions with members of management with the specific purpose of identifying, prioritizing and managing those risks that we believe are material to our operations.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee has served as one of our officers or employees at any time. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our board of directors. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of the Compensation Committee.
Communications with Board of Directors
Stockholders may communicate with the full board of directors or individual directors by submitting such communications in writing to Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc., Attention: Board of Directors (or the individual directors), 20321 Valencia Circle, Lake Forest, California 92630. Such communications will be delivered directly to the board of directors (or to the individual directors).
PROPOSAL 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We are seeking an advisory vote of our stockholders on the compensation of our named executive officers, as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act. Our board of directors recommends that you vote in favor of the resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion contained in this proxy statement. Since the vote is advisory in nature, the results will not be binding on our board of directors or our Compensation Committee. However, if there is a significant vote against the compensation of our named executive officers, our board of directors and our Compensation Committee will carefully evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Following our 2013 annual stockholder meeting, we considered the voting results on the non-binding stockholder vote on the frequency of holding advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. Based on all of the factors taken into consideration, we decided to hold an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers until our 2018 annual stockholder meeting, and therefore at the Annual Meeting stockholders are being asked again on how frequently we should hold the advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers.
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY recommends AND URGES EACH STOCKHOLDER TO vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K.
PROPOSAL 3—ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES 
ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are also seeking a vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on a resolution regarding the frequency of future advisory votes the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Stockholders may vote to approve holding an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every one, two or three years.
After considering the benefits and consequences of each option for the frequency of submitting the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers to our stockholders, our board of directors recommends submitting the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers to our stockholders every three years.
We believe that holding an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years, with the flexibility to hold such a vote more frequently if appropriate, is the best approach for the Company at this time for the following reason:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A three year cycle is consistent with the long-term focus of our compensation objectives and programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A longer vote cycle reinforces a longer-term perspective with respect to our executive compensation program, providing our board of directors and our Compensation Committee with time to evaluate the results of the most recent stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation, as well as to develop and implement changes to our compensation policies and practices that may be appropriate, and then providing our board of directors, our Compensation Committee and our stockholders with the opportunity to assess the impact of those changes before the next such stockholder advisory vote.  
[END TABLE]
For the reasons discussed above, our board of directors recommends the stockholders vote in favor of holding an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years. In voting on this advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers, stockholders should be aware that they are not voting "for" or "against" the recommendation of our board of directors to vote for a frequency of every three years for holding future advisory votes. Rather, stockholders will be casting votes to recommend an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers which may be every one, two or three years, or they may abstain entirely from voting on the proposal.
The option on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers that receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this matter will be considered by our board of directors and our Compensation Committee as the stockhldesr' recommendation as to the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers. However, the outcome of this advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation our named executive officers is not binding on us, our board of directors or our Compensation Committee. Nevertheless, our board of directors and our Compensation Committee will review and consider the outcome of this vote when making determinations as to when the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers will again be submitted to stockholders for approval at an annual meeting of stockholders within the next three years.
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY recommends AND URGES EACH STOCKHOLDER TO vote FOR "THREE YEARS" WITH RESPECT TO THE FREQUENCY OF HOLDING FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
PROPOSAL 4—RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Our board of directors, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, has appointed SingerLewak LLP ("Singer") as our independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the accounts of our Company and our subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Singer performed the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have been advised by Singer that no member of that firm, to the best of its knowledge and belief, has any direct or any material indirect financial interest in our Company or our subsidiaries, and that, during the past three fiscal years, no member of the firm has had any connection with our Company or our subsidiaries in the capacity of promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. Although we do not expect a representative of Singer to attend our Annual Meeting, if a Singer representative does attend, the representative will respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if the representative desires to do so.
Although ratification by our stockholders is not a prerequisite to the Audit Committee's ability to select Singer as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee believes such ratification is advisable and in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders are being requested to ratify, confirm and approve the selection of Singer as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018. Notwithstanding ratification of the appointment of Singer as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee may select another independent registered public accounting firm for such year without any vote of the stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the matter of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm will be considered by our board of directors and the Audit Committee, but our board of directors and the Audit Committee may choose to retain Singer regardless of the vote.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends and urges each stockholder to vote "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF the appointment of SingerLewak LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.

The following table summarizes the aggregate fees billed to us by Singer for professional services during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

Our Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent public accountants on a case-by-case basis. Our Audit Committee approved 100% of the services performed by Singer in 2017 and 2016.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee has:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management;  
• discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and  
• received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence.  
[END TABLE]

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Overview
The Company's compensation policies and practices are developed and implemented through the Compensation Committee of the board of directors.  The Committee's responsibility is to review and consider annually the performance of the Company's named executive officers in achieving both corporate and individual goals and objectives, and to assure that the Company's compensation policies and practices are competitive and effective in incentivizing management.
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section provides a description of the primary elements of the Company's fiscal year 2017 compensation program and policies for all executive officers, who are referred to as our named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Lugee Li, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer  
● Bruce Bromage, Chief Operating Officer  
● Bryce Van, Vice President-Finance  
● Isaac Bresnick, Executive Administrator  
● Paul Hauck, Former Vice President- Worldwide Sales and Support  
● Tony Chung, Former Chief Financial Officer  
[END TABLE]
In 2017, our named executive officers effectively completed multiple transactions important to the long-term success of the Company, including the continued expansion of the Company's sales and marketing network, the related expansion of our sales pipeline for future production orders and licensing transactions, and the relocation of our principal operating facility.  
Compensation Committee activities in 2017 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Evaluating the performance of the Company's executive officers;  
● Reviewing and approving the total compensation and benefits of the Company's executive officers, including cash compensation and long-term incentive compensation; and  
● Reviewing and amending guidelines and standards regarding the Company's compensation practices and philosophy.  
[END TABLE]
For the Company's named executive officers, the Compensation Committee established compensation levels based, in part, on a framework of compensation benchmarking of comparable companies provided by external compensation consultants. To obtain access to independent compensation data, analysis and advice, an independent compensation consulting firm, PayScale, was retained in 2017 by the Compensation Committee. The principal projects assigned to the consultant include evaluation of the composition of the peer group of companies, evaluation of levels of executive compensation as compared to general market compensation data and the peer companies' compensation data, and evaluation of proposed compensation programs or changes to existing programs. PayScale does not provide any other services to the Company and works with the Company's management only on matters for which the Compensation Committee is responsible. The Compensation Committee is required to consider all factors relevant to a compensation consultant's independence from management. The Compensation Committee has determined that the engagement of PayScale does not raise any independence, conflict of interest or similar concerns.
This section should be read in conjunction with the "Summary Compensation Table" and related tables pertaining to the compensation earned in 2017 by the named executive officers under the caption "Executive Compensation."
Compensation Philosophy
The Company's business plan and goals have historically been and continue to be linked to the development of the Company's proprietary technology and production processes, as well as the commercialization and adoption of the technology within a wide array of markets.  The Company's annual cash resources are focused on funding the completion of this development process.  
It is critical to the development and commercialization of the Company's technology that the Company attracts and retains well-qualified executives familiar with manufacturing and sale of amorphous metal and bulk metallic glass products.  As a result, the Company's executive compensation programs seek to maintain a competitive annual salary structure while emphasizing long-term incentives that are connected to the ultimate commercialization and success of the technology.  These programs strive to align the interests of the executive officers and management with those of the Company's shareholders through the use of equity-based programs.
Elements of Compensation
The Company's compensation program has four primary components: cash salary, performance-based cash awards, long-term incentives through equity stock awards and benefits.  Each element of the Company's compensation program has been specifically chosen to reward, motivate and incentivize the executives of the Company through the commercialization phase of the technology and beyond.  The Compensation Committee determines the amount for both total compensation and each compensation element through discussions with the Company's management, consideration of benchmarking data, past performance and future corporate and individual objectives.
The four basic elements of compensation, described in further detail below, are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● SALARY.  Base salaries for the Company's named executives are determined by the Compensation Committee depending on a variety of factors including the scope of their responsibilities, their leadership skills and values, their performance and length of service.  Salaries for our named executive officers are intended to create a minimum level of compensation that is competitive with other companies, deemed comparable, depending on the prior experience and position of the executive. Decisions regarding salary increases are affected by the named executive's current salary and the amounts paid to their peers within and outside the Company.  
● LONG-TERM INCENTIVES.  The primary form of incentive compensation that is offered to the Company's executives consists of long-term incentives in the form of equity awards.  The use of such long-term incentives is intended to focus and align goals of Company executives with those of shareholders and creates a direct interest in the results of operations, long-term performance and achievement of the Company's long-term goals.  
● PERFORMANCE BASED CASH AWARDS.  The Compensation Committee believes that it is important to offer cash incentives to executives for the achievement of specified objectives that yield increased value for shareholders and will utilize performance based cash awards, on a discretionary basis, to provide additional incentives.  
● BENEFITS.  The Compensation Committee also incorporates retirement, insurance, termination and severance benefits in the compensation program for executive officers.  These benefits are offered to retain top executives, maintain their health and wellness and remain competitive in the industry.  The retirement and insurance benefits are consistent with those benefits offered more broadly to the Company's employees.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's overall compensation packages for our named executive officers currently emphasize a mix of the four basic elements of compensation outlined above. With this balancing of both short and long-term incentives, the Company's overall compensation is established at a level comparable to our peer group of companies, which share a similar focus on both short-term strategies and long-term tactical plans for the development of their respective technologies.
Use of Peer Group
Our main asset consists of our patented technology in the field of amorphous metal manufacturing and our business is primarily focused on development, commercialization and manufacturing of this technology within a wide array of industries. 
We have identified a peer group of companies with a similar location and an emphasis of high tech manufacturing.
Benchmarking
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to understand and analyze the current compensation programs of other companies when making compensation decisions.  We traditionally consider the compensation programs of our peers when determining compensation for the named executive officers.  This year the Committee reviewed externally prepared surveys and publicly available information for our peer group companies to compare the components of our compensation program for the executive officers with those of the peer group.
Due to the Company's unique business plan and current focus on development of the technology, the Compensation Committee exercises its discretion in determining compensation packages that may differ from the peer group.  Nevertheless, the peer group is instructive in assessing elements of compensation and structure for similarly situated companies.
While the Company's current compensation program for our executive officers differs in certain aspects from our peers, the Compensation Committee generally targets total compensation packages of our named executive officers to be within the 50th percentile of the peer group.
Performance Objectives
For 2017, the Compensation Committee considered performance objectives in the development timelines of our technology, while also taking into account that long-term incentives, including stock options, have already been put in place during the prior four years through issuances from the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 2015 Equity Incentive Plans.  Objectives in 2017 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Continued refinement of the Company's manufacturing capabilities, inclusive of relocation to a larger manufacturing facility and qualifying lower cost tooling and alloy supplies;  
● Successful delivery of production parts from the Company's manufacturing center; and  
● Continued expansion of the sales pipeline and identification of suitable applications for the technology.

Elements of 2017 Compensation
1.  SALARY.  In evaluating base salaries for 2017, the Compensation Committee believed it was important to maintain competitive base salary compensation. In 2017, Mr. Bromage's annual base salary was increased from $240,000 to $291,000 concurrent with this appointment as Chief Operating Officer on October 18, 2017. Mr. Van's annual salary was set at $210,000 upon his appointment to Vice President-Finance on August 16, 2017, and was later increased to $213,000 to align with market comparisons. Mr. Hauck's annual base salary was set at $265,000, which was consistent with the previous year. Mr. Bresnick's annual salary was increased to $154,000 on October 18, 2017 to align with market. Up until his separation from the Company on August 16, 2017, Mr. Chung's annual base salary was set at $240,000, of which $155,077 was earned as of the separation date. Professor Li is not receiving an annual salary for his service as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
2.  LONG-TERM INCENTIVES.  The Compensation Committee has chosen to rely upon equity instruments, namely options, in designing compensation packages for executives.  The Compensation Committee views the grant of equity based awards as an incentive for future performance since the value of these equity based awards will increase as the Company's stock price increases, thereby satisfying the Compensation Committee's goal of linking executive compensation to share price appreciation over the longer term and promoting the retention of the key executives throughout the development process of our technology.  In 2017, options for the purchase of common stock of 240,000, 120,000, 240,000, 240,000 and 240,000 were granted to Mr. Bromage, Mr. Van, Mr. Hauck, Mr. Bresnick, and Mr. Chung, respectively. Professor Li did not receive any options in 2017 related to his service as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
3.  CASH AWARDS.  The Compensation Committee elected not to award short-term incentive cash bonuses during 2017 as a means of reducing operating expenses and focusing on fundamental improvements in manufacturing and sales operations. The Compensation Committee continues to value short-term incentive awards as part of the overall compensation mix and will consider granting such awards in future periods.
4.  BENEFITS.  As noted above, retirement and insurance benefits for named executive officers are consistent with those benefits offered more broadly to the Company's employees.  Termination and severance terms, specifically in instances of change in control, are defined under existing employment agreements, as described below (see "Employment Agreements and Change of Control Agreements").

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Professor Li, our Chief Executive Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the annual total compensation of our median employee was reasonably estimated to be $110,000; and  
● the annual total compensation of Professor Li was $0.  
[END TABLE]
Because Professor Li did not receive any compensation or employer-paid welfare benefits from the Company in 2017, we cannot provide a ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee.
We identified our median employee using a multi-step process. First, we examined the base salaries and wages of all individuals employed by us on December 31, 2017 (other than Professor Li), to identify the median base salary of all our employees. We annualized wages and salaries for all employees who were hired after January 1, 2017, as permitted by SEC rules. We then calculated the total compensation of each of the employees to whom we paid the median base salary according to the same rules we use to calculate the total compensation of our named executive officers reported in the Summary Compensation Table, including the value stock option grants. We selected the individual within such group whose total compensation was at the median to serve as our median employee whose compensation is disclosed above.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Our executive officers, directors and all of our employees are allowed to participate in our equity inventive plans. We believe that providing them with the ability to participate in such plans provides them with a further incentive towards ensuring our success and accomplishing our corporate goals.

Employment Agreements and Change of Control Agreement
On August 16, 2017, the Company and Tony Chung, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release pursuant to which Mr. Chung resigned as an officer and employee of the Company (the "Tony Chung Separation Agreement"). The Tony Chung Separation Agreement provided for the payment of severance compensation to Mr. Chung in the form of a continuation of his base annual salary of $240,000 (subject to tax withholdings) for a period of 12 months and reimbursement for COBRA healthcare coverage for a period of 12 months. In addition, it provided for the accelerated vesting of 247,650 of the unvested stock options held by Mr. Chung as of the separation date and the extension of the exercise period of his options until the first anniversary of the date of the Tony Chung Separation Agreement. This resulted in a total of 2,889,749 stock options being exercisable by Mr. Chung as of the separation date and resulted in an additional $89,000 of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the Tony Chung Separation Agreement, Mr. Chung and the Company granted each other mutual general releases subject to customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had accrued liabilities totaling $164,000 and $0, respectively, relating to the Tony Chung Separation Agreement.
On March 10, 2016, the Company amended its Change of Control Agreements with its named executive officers (the "Change of Control Agreements"). As so amended, the Change of Control Agreements provide that if the executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated without cause during the one-year period after a change of control of the Company, then the terminated officer will receive a lump sum severance compensation in an amount equal to twelve months of his then-current base salary. The executive officers will each also be entitled to the above-described severance compensation in the event he terminates his own employment within one year after a change of control because of a salary decrease, assignment to a lower-level position or a required move of more than 25 miles. In addition to the above-described severance compensation, upon any termination described in this paragraph, all unvested stock options related to these officers will automatically and immediately vest and shall thereafter be exercisable in accordance with the terms and provisions of the applicable award agreements. "Change of control" is defined in the Change of Control Agreements, with certain exceptions, as a merger of the Company with a third-party, the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the acquisition by a single person or group of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities. "Cause" is defined in the Change of Control Agreements to include fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty, material harm to the Company or an uncured failure to adequately perform job duties, among other things.
Professor Li does not have an employment agreement or change of control agreement with the Company.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table and summary set forth estimated potential payments the Company would be required to make to our named executive officers upon termination of employment or change in control of the Company, pursuant to each executive's employment agreement in effect at year end.

   (1)   Professor Li does not have an employment agreement, nor is he currently receiving any form of compensation from the Company.  
   (2)   Severance amounts also apply if Mr. Bromage, Mr. Van, and/or Mr. Bresnick terminate their own employment within one year after a change of control because of a salary decrease, assignment to a lower-level position or a required move of more than 25 miles.

401(k) Savings Plan 
We have adopted a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan, or 401(k) plan, that covers all of our employees. Pursuant to our 401(k) plan, participants may elect to reduce their current compensation, on a pre-tax basis, by an amount up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit and have the amount of the reduction contributed to the 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan permits us, in our sole discretion, to make additional employer contributions to the 401(k) plan. However, we do not currently make employer contributions to the 401(k) plan and may not do so in the future. As such, contributions by employees or by us to the 401(k) plan, and the income earned on plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) plan, and we can deduct our contributions, if any, at the time they are made.
Pension Benefits 
We do not sponsor any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit plans.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
We do not maintain any non-qualified defined contribution or deferred compensation plans. The Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of "outside directors" as defined for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, may elect to provide our officers and other employees with non-qualified defined contribution or deferred compensation benefits if the Compensation Committee determines that doing so is in our best interests.
Compensation Risk Considerations 
When establishing and reviewing our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considers whether such compensation programs for all employees, including our named executive officers, encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. We believe that our compensation programs are balanced and do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk. We believe we have achieved this by striking an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term incentives and by using a variety of key business measurement metrics that promote disciplined progress towards longer-term company goals to assess performance under our compensation program.
Director Compensation 
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation received by each of our non-employee directors serving during the year ended December 31, 2017:

Our non-employee directors receive certain compensation for their services and are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings, as determined by the board of directors. Each non-employee director received an annual base fee of $15,000. In addition, each non-employee director receives annual fees to act as chairmen or members of the various sub-committees of the board of directors. Such fees are $5,000 per member. All fees are paid quarterly in arrears.
We have a 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and a 2015 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to which our non-employee directors are entitled to receive stock options. Each non-employee director in office on February 7, 2017 received an annual grant of options to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, non-employee directors may be entitled to receive options on a case by case basis, in an amount determined by our board of directors or the Compensation Committee in its respective discretion, to purchase shares of common stock upon initial election to the board of directors. In determining the number of options granted to a director upon initial election, the Compensation Committee uses its judgment and, consistent with our compensation objectives, maintains the flexibility necessary to recruit qualified and experienced directors. In connection with Mr. Chung's election as a director on August 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of options to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock. All options granted under the plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. These stock options have a 10-year term and are exercisable pursuant to an equal 3-year vesting schedule, and remain exercisable for certain periods of time after a person is no longer a director.
No director who is an employee will receive separate compensation for services rendered as a director. However, our employee directors are eligible to participate in our 2012 and 2015 Equity Incentive Plans.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with Related Persons 
On August 16, 2017, we entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release pursuant to which Mr. Chung resigned as an officer and employee of the Company (the "Tony Chung Separation Agreement"). The Tony Chung Separation Agreement provided for the payment of severance compensation to Mr. Chung in the form of a continuation of his base annual salary of $240,000 (subject to tax withholdings) for a period of 12 months and reimbursement for COBRA healthcare coverage for a period of 12 months. In addition, it provided for the accelerated vesting of 247,650 of the unvested stock options held by Mr. Chung as of the separation date and the extension of the exercise period of his options until the first anniversary of the date of the Tony Chung Separation Agreement. This resulted in a total of 2,889,749 stock options being exercisable by Mr. Chung as of the separation date and resulted in an additional $89,000 of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the Tony Chung Separation Agreement, Mr. Chung and the Company granted each other mutual general releases subject to customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company had accrued liabilities totaling $164,000 and $0, respectively, relating to the Tony Chung Separation Agreement.
On March 10, 2016, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Liquidmetal Technology Limited, providing for the purchase of 405,000,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $63,400,000 (the "2016 Purchase Agreement"). Liquidmetal Technology Limited is a newly formed company owned by Professor Li. In connection with the 2016 Purchase Agreement and also on March 10, 2016 we entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we entered into a cross-license with Eontec of our respective technologies. Eontec is a publicly held Hong Kong corporation of which Professor Li is the Chairman and major shareholder. As of December 31, 2017, Professor Li is a greater-than 5% beneficial owner of our common stock and serves as our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Equipment and services procured from Eontec were $877,000, $68,000, and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
Our policy is to require that any transaction with a related party required to be reported under applicable SEC rules, other than compensation-related matters, be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee of our board of directors. The Audit Committee of our board of directors has not adopted specific procedures for review of, or standards for approval of, these transactions, but instead reviews such transactions on a case by case basis. Our policy is to require that all compensation-related matters be recommended for board of directors approval by the Compensation Committee. During the last fiscal year and through the date of this proxy statement, no transactions with a related party occurred that required a waiver of this policy and no transactions with a related party occurred in which we did not follow this policy.
