UNITED STATES  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  Washington, D.C. 20549  
SCHEDULE 14A  
Proxy Statement Pursuant to Section 14(a) of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Amendment No.          ) 
 Table of Contents 
Dear Stockholder, 
        It is my pleasure to invite you to attend our annual meeting of stockholders on May 1, 2019. At the meeting, we will review AptarGroup's performance for fiscal year 2018 and our outlook for the future. 
        We are pleased to take advantage of the Securities and Exchange Commission rule allowing companies to furnish proxy materials to their stockholders over the Internet. We believe that this e-proxy process expedites stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, while also lowering the costs and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting. Today, we mailed to most of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and annual report and vote online. All other stockholders will continue to receive a copy of the proxy statement and annual report by mail unless they elect to receive the annual meeting materials over the Internet. 
        The Notice contains instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of the proxy statement and annual report, if you only received a Notice by mail. 
        The vote of each stockholder is important to us. Whether or not you expect to attend the annual meeting, I urge you to vote by the Internet or by telephone as soon as possible. If you received a printed copy of the proxy materials, you may also complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the envelope that was included with the printed materials. 
        Help us "go green" and reduce costs. For those stockholders who are still receiving paper copies of our proxy statement and annual report, please consider requesting electronic delivery or a Notice which will reduce the amount of paper materials needed to conduct our annual meeting. You may do so by contacting your broker, visiting www.proxyvote.com or emailing us at investorrelations@aptar.com.
        I look forward to seeing you on May 1 and addressing your questions and comments.

("Aptar" or "Company") to be held on May 1, 2019, beginning at 9:30 a.m. (local time), at Aptar's corporate headquarters, 265 Exchange Drive, Suite 100, Crystal Lake, IL 60014, and at any postponements or adjournments of the meeting. This proxy statement was prepared under the direction of Aptar's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors" or "Board") to solicit your proxy for use at the annual meeting. In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each stockholder of record or beneficial owner, we are furnishing proxy materials, which include this proxy statement, the notice of meeting and our Annual Report/Form 10-K, to our stockholders over the Internet. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials. Instead, the Notice instructs you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice also instructs you as to how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. The Notice was mailed to stockholders on or about March 22, 2019. 
      Who is entitled to vote?         
        Stockholders owning our common stock at the close of business on March 8, 2019 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting, or any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. Each stockholder has one vote per share on all matters to be voted on at the meeting. At the close of business on March 8, 2019, there were 63,013,495 shares of common stock outstanding. 
      What am I voting on?         
        You are asked to vote on the following proposals: Table of Contents
        The Board of Directors knows of no other business that will be presented at the annual meeting. If other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote on them in accordance with their best judgment. 
      How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on the proposals?         
        The Board has unanimously approved and recommends that you vote your shares:
        Unless you give other instructions when voting your proxy, the persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. 
      How do I vote?         
        If you are a record holder, you can vote your proxy in any of the following ways: 
        When voting on each nominee or proposal, you have three options: Table of Contents
        If you return your proxy with no voting instructions marked on a nominee or proposal, your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board on such nominee or proposal as presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the annual meeting. 
        If you are a record holder, you can revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by any of the following methods:
      What is a quorum?         
        A "quorum" is the presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Aptar's common stock on March 8, 2019. There must be a quorum for the meeting to be held. 
      How are shares in a 401(k) plan voted?         
        If you hold shares of Aptar through your 401(k) plan, you will be instructing the trustee how to vote your shares by voting by Internet or by telephone, or by completing and returning the proxy card. If you do not vote by Internet or telephone or if you do not return the proxy card, or if you return it with unclear voting instructions, the trustee will not vote the shares in your 401(k) plan. 
      How are shares held in a broker account voted?         
        If you own shares through a broker, you should be contacted by your broker regarding a proxy card and whether telephone or Internet voting options are available. If you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your broker, as the registered holder of your shares, may represent your shares at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. Even without instructions, your broker may exercise discretion in voting for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. Brokers have authority to vote in their discretion on "routine" matters if they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Other than the proposal regarding the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm, all other proposals are not considered "routine" matters and, as a result, brokers may not vote on behalf of their clients if no voting instructions have been furnished. Broker non-votes are counted as shares present  Table of Contents in determining whether the quorum requirement is satisfied but do not affect the outcome of whether a matter is approved. 
      How many votes are required to approve each proposal?         
        In order to be elected, a director nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Stockholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Abstaining will not affect the outcome of director elections. The approval of each other proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on these proposals. Abstaining is the legal equivalent of voting against these proposals. 
      Who will count the votes?         
        Our agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., will count the votes cast by proxy or in person at the annual meeting. 
      How can I help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meeting?         
        We encourage you to choose electronic (e-mail) delivery of future annual meeting materials by contacting your broker or emailing us at investorrelations@aptar.com. You may also visit www.proxyvote.com and follow the Vote By Internet instructions on the proxy card or the Notice to be provided with the opportunity to choose electronic delivery for future meeting materials.  Table of Contents 
        The Board of Directors is currently comprised of eleven members divided into three classes, with one class of directors elected each year for a three year term. The Board of Directors proposes the following nominees, two of whom are currently serving as directors and one of whom is a new nominee, to be elected to a term expiring at the 2022 annual meeting. The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors engaged the executive search firm Egon Zehnder International for the purpose of identifying highly qualified director nominee candidates that also support our philosophy on diversity summarized below. As a result of this engagement, the new nominee, Ms. Isabel Marey-Semper, was referred to the Corporate Governance Committee for evaluation and consideration, and has been nominated to stand for election in 2019. Messrs. Chevassus and Hagge are not standing for re-election in 2019. Accordingly, effective at the annual meeting, the Board of Directors will be reduced to ten members. 
        If any of the director nominees is unable or fails to stand for election, the persons named in the proxy intend to vote for a substitute nominee nominated by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. 
        We believe all of the members of the Board of Directors and director nominees are individuals of outstanding character and sound judgment that have the business experience and acumen necessary to work together effectively and to make valuable contributions to the Board of Directors and management. As a U.S.-based company with significant international operations, particularly in Europe, we seek to maintain a balanced Board consisting of directors that are U.S. citizens and directors that are citizens from countries other than the U.S. Additionally, we value the following attributes: operating experience in packaging or packaging-related businesses; skill sets which may include experience in finance, strategic planning, marketing, pharmaceutical products and manufacturing; diversity, including a mix of genders and multi-cultural viewpoints; and previous board of directors experience. Aptar was recognized by the Women's Forum of New York as a "Corporate Champion" for gender diversity in the boardroom. Currently, our Audit, Management Development and Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committees are all chaired by women. 
        Set forth below is biographical and other background information concerning each director nominee and each continuing director. This information includes each person's principal occupation as well as a discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each person that led to the Board of Directors' conclusion that he or she should serve or continue to serve as a director. In addition, set forth below is the year during which each person began serving on the Board of Directors and his or her age.  Table of Contents

      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE       
        Aptar's corporate governance documents are available through the Corporate Governance link on the Investor Relations page of the Aptar website at: investors.aptar.com, and include the following: 
        The information provided on our website is not part of this proxy statement and is therefore not incorporated herein by reference. 
   Corporate Governance Principles  
        The Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Principles to provide guidelines for Aptar and the Board to promote effective corporate governance. The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing the Corporate Governance Principles and recommending any changes to the Board. The Corporate Governance Principles cover topics including, but not limited to: 
   Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  
        Ethical business conduct is a shared value of our Board, management and employees. Aptar's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("Code of Conduct") applies to our Board as well as our employees and officers, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial and accounting officer. The Code of Conduct summarizes the long-standing  Table of Contents principles of conduct that Aptar follows to ensure that business is conducted with integrity and in compliance with the law, including, but not limited to: 
        Aptar encourages all employees, officers and directors to promptly report any violations of the Code of Conduct to the appropriate persons identified in the Code of Conduct. In the event that an amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of the Code of Conduct that applies to any of our directors or executive officers is necessary, Aptar intends to post such information on its website as and when required by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
   Sustainability  
        Aptar is committed to economic, social and environmental sustainability. Our sustainability report can be found on the Sustainability page of the Aptar website at www.aptar.com. 
   Policy Against Hedging and Pledging  
        Our Board has adopted a policy that prohibits executive officers and directors, and discourages employees, from engaging in hedging or pledging transactions involving any equity security of Aptar. 
   Common Stock Ownership Guidelines  
        In 2015, the Board adopted stock ownership guidelines that require all non-executive directors to hold shares of Aptar common stock having a value of at least five times the annual cash retainer.  Table of Contents
        Under the guidelines, directors must achieve the respective level of ownership within a phase-in period consisting of five years from the measurement date of April 17, 2015, which is the date when the guidelines were adopted, or if they became a director after the measurement date, within five years from becoming a director. As of December 31, 2018, every non-executive director (including the Chairman of the Board) is either in compliance with the guidelines or within the phase-in period. 
   Board Structure  
        The Chairman of the Board is an independent director who is not an executive officer or employee of the Company. The Company believes that having an independent Chairman enhances the oversight ability of the Board. An independent Chairman can also provide stability and continuity during senior management transitions. 
        The Board has three primary committees, each with the following characteristics: 
        An affirmative vote of at least 70% of the Board is required to change the size, membership or powers of these committees, to fill vacancies in them, or to dissolve them.  Table of Contents 
        Under the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE listing standards, if an audit committee member simultaneously serves on the audit committee of more than three public companies, the board must determine that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such member to effectively serve on the listed company's audit committee. The Board has determined that the service of Ms. Montiel on the audit committee of more than three public companies does not impair her ability to serve effectively as a member of our Audit Committee. 
        For further information on this committee's procedures for consideration of executive compensation, see our "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
        Under the Management Development and Compensation Committee charter, this committee has the authority to retain outside advisers as deemed necessary. In 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to be the Management Development and Compensation Committee's adviser and has also done so for 2019. The Management Development and Compensation Committee has determined  Table of Contents that Willis Towers Watson is independent according to the advisor independence factors outlined by the NYSE.

[END TABLE]
      Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices         
        The Company has concluded that there are not any compensation policies or practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Board concurred with this conclusion. In conducting its risk assessment related to compensation policies and practices, the Company considered, among other things, that the policies and practices do not offer the opportunity for excessive awards, the Company has reasonable stock ownership guidelines, the policies and practices are reviewed and approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee, the Company has an established,  Table of Contents robust control environment and the Company conducts a regular monthly business review that monitors quality of reporting and prevents excessive risk taking. 
      Independence of Directors         
        Our Corporate Governance Principles were revised in January 2018 to provide that the Board must be composed of a substantial majority of independent directors with an objective of having the Board consist entirely of independent directors (other than the CEO and any non-independent director serving on the Board as of January 2018). No director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Aptar either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Aptar. 
        The Board has made its independence determination based on the following categorical standards, in addition to any other relevant facts and circumstances. These standards provide that a director generally will not be independent if: Table of Contents
        The Board considers the following to be immaterial when making independence determinations: Table of Contents
      Executive Sessions         
        Non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions without management. "Non-management" directors are all those who are not Company officers. Executive sessions are led by a "Presiding Director." An executive session is held in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Board meeting and other sessions may be called by the Presiding Director in his or her own discretion or at the request of the Board. Mr. Fotiades has been designated as the Presiding Director. 
      Nomination of Directors         
        In identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Corporate Governance Committee takes into account the applicable requirements for directors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has established a maximum age limit for director nominees. Nominees must be 74 years old or younger at the time of election. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee may take into consideration such factors and criteria as it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to:

[END TABLE]
        In addition to candidates recommended by members of the Board or management, the Corporate Governance Committee also considers individuals recommended by stockholders. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates candidates recommended for director by stockholders in the same way that it evaluates any nominee recommended by members of the Board or management. In order to recommend a candidate, stockholders must submit the individual's name and qualifications in writing to the Corporate Governance Committee (in care of the Secretary at Aptar's principal executive offices at 265 Exchange Drive, Suite 100, Crystal Lake, Illinois 60014) and otherwise in accordance with all of the procedures outlined under "Other Matters—Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" for a director nomination. 
        The Corporate Governance Committee may engage outside advisors to identify potential director candidates from time to time. The effectiveness of the nomination process is evaluated by the Board each year as part of its annual self-evaluation and more formally by the Corporate Governance Committee as it evaluates and identifies director candidates.  Table of Contents
      Majority Voting Policy         
        Our amended and restated by-laws require majority voting for the election of directors in uncontested elections. This means that a director nominee in an uncontested election must receive a number of votes "FOR" that director's election that exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director's election. Our Corporate Governance Principles further provide that any incumbent director who does not receive a majority of "FOR" votes will promptly tender to the Board his or her resignation from the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will consider the recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within 120 days after the annual meeting. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her resignation. 
      Communications with the Board of Directors         
        The Board has established a process for stockholders and other interested parties to communicate with the Board or an individual director, including the Presiding Director or the non-management directors as a group. A stockholder or other interested party may contact the Board or an individual director by writing to their attention at Aptar's principal executive offices at 265 Exchange Drive, Suite 100, Crystal Lake, Illinois 60014. Communications received in writing are distributed to the Board or to individual directors as appropriate in accordance with procedures approved by Aptar's independent directors.  Table of Contents 
      BOARD MEETING ATTENDANCE       
        The Board met 9 times in 2018. During 2018, no director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board held during such director's term and the committees on which each director then served. Aptar does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at the annual meeting of stockholders. Messrs. Tanda and Harris attended the 2018 annual meeting.

      BOARD COMPENSATION       
        Employees of Aptar do not receive any additional compensation for serving as members of the Board or any of its committees. In 2018, cash compensation of non-employee directors consisted of the following: 
        Following a review of a competitive analysis and benchmarking by Willis Towers Watson, in 2018, the Board approved $2,500, $2,000 and $15,000 increases to the annual retainers for the Management Development and Compensation Chairperson, Audit Committee Chairperson and Chairman of the Board, respectively. 
        Each director is reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred while attending Board and committee meetings, and each director is eligible to participate in Aptar's matching gift program, which matches eligible charitable donations by employees and non-employee directors up to an aggregate of $6,000 annually per person. No retirement benefits or perquisites are provided to any non-employee director. 
        In addition, each non-employee director received an equity grant under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan with a grant date fair value equal to approximately $130,000, except for the Chairman of the Board, who received an equity grant with a grant date fair value equal to approximately $150,000. Accordingly, on May 2, 2018, each then-serving non-employee director (other than the Chairman of the Board) was granted 1,404 RSUs and the Chairman of the Board was granted 1,621 RSUs. The 2018 RSUs vest on May 1, 2019, subject to the non-employee director's continued service through such date.

        Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Aptar stockholders are being offered the opportunity to cast an advisory vote at the annual meeting to approve the compensation of Aptar's Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") and tabular disclosures of this proxy statement. This is not a vote on the Company's general compensation policies or the compensation of the Board. We currently intend to submit an advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs to our stockholders annually. 
        Aptar's compensation philosophy and objectives are to fairly reward our executives for growing our business and increasing value to stockholders and to retain our experienced management team. 
        The overall compensation program for NEOs includes an annual performance incentive element that rewards the NEOs for the Company's short-term performance and improvement in Company performance from the prior year, as well as equity-based elements (for 2018, RSUs and long-term performance incentive awards in the form of PRSUs) that provide for long-term compensation that is driven by our share performance and, therefore, is aligned with our stockholders' interests. The specific objectives of our compensation program are that a substantial portion of the NEOs' compensation should be performance-based and should be delivered in the form of equity-based awards. Our CD&A describes our compensation philosophy and objectives in more detail. 
        The Board of Directors values the opinions of our stockholders. Although the resolution is advisory and non-binding, the Board will consider the outcome of the advisory vote when making future compensation decisions. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the following non-binding resolution:
"Resolved, that the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, tabular disclosures, and other narrative executive compensation disclosures in this proxy statement, is hereby approved." Table of Contents
        Aptar is asking stockholders to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as Aptar's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited Aptar's consolidated financial statements annually for over 25 years. 
        As described in its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, retention, termination, compensation and oversight of Aptar's independent registered public accounting firm. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee considers the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm. In selecting PwC as Aptar's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, the Audit Committee evaluated, among other factors:
        PwC rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years; the Audit Committee interviews proposed candidates and selects the lead audit engagement partner. 
        Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. It is also expected that those representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions.  Table of Contents

      Compensation Philosophy and Objectives         
        Our compensation philosophy and objectives are, first and foremost, to fairly and competitively compensate our executives for growing our business and increasing value for stockholders and, secondly, to retain our experienced management team. The following factors are supportive of our compensation objectives:
      Stockholder Feedback on Compensation Practices         
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee considered the continued support that our proposal on executive compensation received from stockholders at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, at which approximately 97% of votes cast (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes) were in favor of our compensation policies and practices. Therefore, no changes were made to our principal compensation policies or practices in response to the advisory vote.  Table of Contents
      Compensation Determination         
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee takes into account an assortment of factors and reviews a variety of information before setting annual compensation levels, as listed on the following table:

        The Management Development and Compensation Committee has historically intended to create a compensation program for NEOs that generally targets total direct compensation (combined salary, annual performance incentives and long-term performance incentives) at the median of total direct compensation delivered to individuals with comparable duties and revenue responsibilities in companies similar in size to Aptar. The Management Development and Compensation Committee would consider setting total direct compensation above the 50th percentile should circumstances such as executive tenure, company performance or individual performance warrant above median positioning. The benchmarking study conducted by Willis Towers Watson in 2018, described in further detail below, noted the following high-level findings for our executive officers, including NEOs, as compared to general industry survey data:
        Aptar maintains a 20-company compensation peer group ("Peer Group") that was approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee, which, for select NEOs, serves as a supplement to the general industry published survey data that remains as the primary data source given its deemed appropriateness from a size perspective. Additionally, the Peer Group is used for industry financial comparison purposes and as a source of data for compensation plan design characteristics. In consultation with Willis Towers  Table of Contents
Watson, the following characteristics of the Peer Group are considered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee in assessing its reasonableness:
        The Peer Group does not represent an exhaustive or comprehensive list of all of Aptar's competitors. Rather, it includes a set of companies that meet the criteria above and have been approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee for evaluating executive compensation. The Management Development and Compensation Committee will monitor the Peer Group for potential revisions in light of changing market or business conditions. Following a Peer Group review conducted in 2017, the following changes were made to the Peer Group to be used in connection with the Management Development and Compensation Committee's 2018 competitive analysis:
        The following companies are contained in the 2018 Peer Group:  Table of Contents 
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee reviews compensation survey information prepared by Willis Towers Watson for the CEO and other executive officer positions annually. Consistent with prior years, the compensation elements evaluated by Willis Towers Watson are base salary, target annual cash incentives, target total cash compensation (the sum of base salaries and target cash incentives), target LTI, and target total direct compensation (the sum of target total cash compensation and target LTI). In considering compensation for the CEO and CFO, the Management Development and Compensation Committee considered proxy peer group compensation data in addition to the compensation survey information prepared by Willis Towers Watson. When determining the 2018 compensation opportunities of executive officers other than Mr. Tanda, the Management Development and Compensation Committee also reviewed recommendations furnished by Mr. Tanda, including salary, target annual cash incentive and target LTI recommendations. In 2018, Mr. Tanda, participated in all discussions regarding salaries and incentive compensation for all of our executive officers, except during discussions regarding his own salary and incentive compensation. Mr. Tanda made suggestions or recommendations during these discussions; however, all deliberations and determinations regarding the compensation of our executive officers were made solely by the Management Development and Compensation Committee. 
        Base salary, target annual incentive opportunities and long-term incentive grant values are provided by Willis Towers Watson from its proprietary U.S. and non-U.S. executive compensation surveys, which contain general industry data from hundreds of companies. Wherever possible, the market data are adjusted to Aptar's revenue size using regression analysis (based on Aptar's revenue and the respective position's responsibilities, as summarized below). The same compensation elements were also reviewed in Willis Towers Watson's peer group proxy analysis for Messrs. Tanda and Kuhn. 
        Given the adjustments made to the data to reflect Aptar's revenue size, the Management Development and Compensation Committee does not consider the specific identities of the companies included in the surveys to be material for purposes of its compensation deliberations and, accordingly, the specific identities of the companies included within each survey sample are not disclosed to the Management Development and Compensation Committee. 
        The information related to base salary and annual cash incentive compensation that was provided by Willis Towers Watson in 2018 was regressed for US data (French data is size-adjusted) based on the following annual revenue responsibilities, which are representative of Aptar's approximate revenue size:
        As noted earlier, based on Willis Towers Watson's benchmarking analysis that was furnished to the Management Development and Compensation Committee, Aptar's 2018 total direct compensation for the executive officers, including NEOs, in aggregate was positioned  Table of Contents between the median and 75th percentile of the published survey data. Specifically, with respect to the CEO and CFO, most elements of total direct compensation were generally competitive with the 50th percentile with respect to the additional peer proxy statement analysis. 
      Elements of Our Compensation Programs         
        We manage our business for the long-term benefit of all stakeholders and consequently we believe that it is important that our senior management receive a substantial portion of their compensation in the form of long-term incentives, or LTIs, with base salary and annual cash incentives representing a smaller percentage of annual compensation. Historically, a substantial portion of NEO LTI compensation has been delivered in the form of time-vested stock options and cash-settled outperformance awards. Additionally, RSUs have generally only been awarded in lieu of up to 50% of the executive's annual cash performance incentive, at the executive's election, or for retention purposes, as determined by the committee. Beginning in 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee replaced the prior LTI program structure of annual grants of stock options and cash-settled outperformance awards with annual equity grants of RSUs and PRSUs. The PRSUs vest based on relative TSR and ROIC performance over three-year performance period, subject to a threshold level of achievement. These changes are intended to:
        When determining the appropriate amount of equity compensation to be awarded to executive officers, the Management Development and Compensation Committee considers the value of the equity award relative to market practice and in consideration of total direct compensation. The 2018 LTI award for Ms. Gong was made in recognition of Ms. Gong's forfeited equity awards provided to her from her former employer and was established pursuant to an employment agreement between Ms. Gong and the Company. For a description of Ms. Gong's employment agreement, please see the information below under "Gong Employment Agreement." 
         Salary.    The salary level of the CEO is established by the Management Development and Compensation Committee each January after evaluating individual performance and discussing the market data provided by Willis Towers Watson. The salary levels of other NEOs are also set each January after evaluating and discussing the recommendations of the CEO and reviewing any relevant market data provided by Willis Towers Watson for the other NEO  Table of Contents positions. In 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee increased the salaries of our then-serving NEOs from the 2017 levels as follows: 
Annual Performance Incentives ("APIs").  
        Generally, APIs in the form of variable cash incentive compensation are provided to our NEOs. The APIs are designed to reward, when earned, achievement of performance goals that are deemed critical to the business, our strategy and aligned with stockholder value creation. For 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee included improvement measures as the Company performance goals for determining API payouts as it believed that the 2018 API amounts should reflect Aptar's financial performance improvement from the prior year and, accordingly, if Aptar's financial performance declined from the prior year, then no cash API payout would be awarded to the NEOs. 
        For 2018, the amount of our NEOs' API was calculated based on (i) his or her target API opportunity and (ii) improvement in Company performance from the prior year, measured based on Adjusted EBITDA and core sales growth performance. For Ms. Gong, her API was prorated for the number of days she was employed by the Company in 2018. The target API opportunity is a percentage each NEO's base salary, and is determined annually based on market data, individual role and responsibilities and individual performance. For 2018, the target API opportunity for each of the NEOs was determined based on market data and the Company's historical pay practices with respect to such position.  Table of Contents
        The following illustrates how the 2018 APIs were calculated: 
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee used the following improvements in Company performance and weightings for 2018 to determine the amount of each NEO's 2018 API. The Management Development and Compensation Committee chose EBTIDA and core sales growth as performance measures because they are directly tied into goals that are deemed critical to the business, our strategy and aligned with stockholder value creation.

 Table of Contents
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee believes it is important to encourage executive officer stock ownership and provide a compensation opportunity that is weighted towards equity. For those reasons, an executive officer may elect to receive up to 50% of his or her cash API in the form of RSUs. If an executive elects to receive a portion of his or her annual performance cash incentive in RSUs, the executive will also receive an additional 20% of the elected amount in the form of RSUs. The value of each RSU is determined by the closing share price on the NYSE on the day preceding the date of grant. RSUs convert into shares of our common stock if the recipient is still employed by us or is an Aptar retiree on the date that RSUs vest. RSUs vest over a three-year period, with one third vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Recipients of RSUs may not vote the units in stockholder votes and they do not earn or receive any dividend payments on the units. 
Kuhn special recognition payment 
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Kuhn an additional $250,000, one-time, award, payable half in cash and half in RSUs, in recognition of his exceptional leadership in connection with the CSP acquisition and leading Human Resources on an interim basis in 2018. 
Long-term Performance Incentives ("LTIs"). 
        We believe that LTI compensation in the form of equity awards provide a strong alignment between the interests of our NEOs and our stockholders. The Management Development and Compensation Committee generally seeks to provide equity award opportunities that are consistent with our compensation philosophy (with the potential for larger payments for exceptional performance). The Management Development and Compensation Committee also believes that long-term equity awards are an essential tool in promoting executive retention. 
         2018 Design Enhancements.    In 2018, the Company replaced its prior practice of annual grants of stock options and cash-settled outperformance awards with an annual grant of RSUs and PRSUs. The Management Development and Compensation Committee made this change after considering market data, input from Willis Towers Watson and the committee's objectives of providing a significant portion of compensation in the form of equity compensation, linking the vesting of a significant portion of the LTIs to the achievement of pre-established performance goals and enhancing the retentive element of the program with the use of time-based RSUs. 
   Setting Award Value:  
        In early 2018, the Management Development and Compensation Committee granted the then-serving NEOs LTI awards. In approving the 2018 LTI awards, the committee approved the target amount of the LTI awards based on individual roles and responsibilities and market data. The 2018 LTI award for Ms. Gong was made in recognition of Ms. Gong's forfeited equity awards provided to her from her former employer and was established pursuant to an  Table of Contents employment agreement between Ms. Gong and the Company. For a description of Ms. Gong's employment agreement, please see the information below under "Gong Employment Agreement." Once the LTI target award value was determined for each NEO, the award was divided between PRSUs and RSUs, weighted 60% and 40%, respectively. 
        The following table sets forth the target award value, as of the date of grant, of the 2018 LTI award received by each NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
PRSUs.  
        For 2018, the Committee granted PRSUs as 60% of the target LTI award, which vest based on the Company's ROIC and relative TSR performance, with potential vesting ranging from 0% to 200% of the target number of shares subject to the award (the "Target Shares"), as follows: Table of Contents over the performance period. For the TSR component, the vesting will be determined in accordance with the following schedule: 
        Each NEO must be continuously employed through the last day of the performance period to receive his or her earned shares, except to the extent an event triggers accelerated vesting of the 2018 PRSUs under the terms of the award agreement or his or her employment or other agreement, as applicable. 
         RSUs:    The remaining component of the 2018 LTI program consisted of time-based RSUs, which vest over a three-year service period, subject to the NEO's continued employment through the applicable vesting date except to the extent an event triggers accelerated vesting of the 2018 RSUs under the terms of the award agreement or his or her employment or other agreement, as applicable. As noted above, the committee introduced RSUs into the annual LTI program to further enhance the retentive aspect of the Company's executive compensation program and to further align the interests of our NEOs with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders. 
         Outstanding Outperformance Awards.    Prior to 2018, outperformance awards were granted to the then-serving NEOs on an annual basis, with vesting based on relative TSR over a three-year performance period. Specifically, the Outperformance TSR Plan provides that if the Company's TSR is equal to or exceeds the 50th percentile of the TSRs for companies that are included in the S&P 400 MidCap Index over a three-year performance period, the NEOs  Table of Contents will be entitled to cash awards equal to a target percentage of base salary multiplied by a percentage determined by the relevant TSR as outlined in the table below.

        Following the conclusion of 2018, payments were made with respect to the awards granted in 2016—approximately 141% of the target amount was earned over the three-year performance period ended in 2018.

[END TABLE]
         Post-Termination compensation.    The employment agreements of our NEOs provide for guaranteed minimum salary levels, death benefits, non-competition clauses and post-termination commitments. The post-termination commitments do not significantly affect the Management Development and Compensation Committee's decisions concerning other compensation elements. We believe that the post-termination commitments included in the NEOs' agreements are not substantially different from what is typical at other companies with revenues similar to those of Aptar. Additional information about the employment agreements, including definitions of key terms and a quantification of benefits that would have been received by our NEOs had termination occurred on December 31, 2018, is found under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment." 
         Retirement Plan Arrangements.    We also offer pension plans to our employees, including NEOs. Additional information regarding our pension plans is found under "Pension Benefits." 
        We maintain profit sharing and savings plans for our employees, including NEOs. These plans permit employees to make such savings in a manner that is relatively tax efficient. 
         Perquisites.    Perquisites have historically not been a significant percentage of overall NEO compensation and therefore generally do not affect the decisions of the Management Development and Compensation Committee when determining other elements of compensation. These perquisites can include a company-provided automobile, memberships in social and professional clubs, and supplemental life insurance, among others. In addition, the Company provides competitive perquisites for NEOs on an expatriate assignment, which it believes are consistent with local market practices. The Management Development and  Table of Contents
Compensation Committee believes it is necessary to provide NEOs with perquisites similar to those provided by other companies in order to recruit and retain the best executive talent. The Management Development and Compensation Committee reviews the perquisites provided to its NEOs on a regular basis. 
Gong Employment Agreement 
        In connection with the commencement of her employment with the Company, Ms. Gong entered into an employment agreement with the Company similar to the employment agreements with our other US-based NEOs with the exception of providing certain sign-on compensation and expatriate benefits to reflect her service in China. In recognition of the fact that Ms. Gong forfeited certain equity awards provided to her by her former employer, her employment agreement provides for the one-time grant of RSUs with a grant date value of $1 million and vesting in three annual installments on November 5, 2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to Ms. Gong's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Ms. Gong also received a "sign-on bonus" of $200,000 in recognition of forfeited bonus that she would have received from her former employer. Pursuant to her employment agreement, Ms. Gong will receive expatriate benefits relating to her current international assignment in China, which began in October 2018. The additional benefits that she receives are directly related to the additional expenses Ms. Gong incurs as a result of her China assignment. Her benefits include (i) automobile and driver (including insurance, maintenance, reasonable fuel, taxes and vehicle registration costs), (ii) dependent schooling, (iii) international health insurance, (iv) travel for two (2) annual trips to the United States for Ms. Gong and her immediate family, (v) housing allowances, (vi) tax equalization payments and preparation services, and (vii) reimbursement for repatriation to the United States upon certain termination events. 
      Stock Ownership         
        Under the stock ownership guidelines, the executive officers must own Company common stock and/or hold RSUs representing a value that is as follows: for the CEO, five times his or her base salary; for the remaining executive officers, one times their base salary. Under the guidelines, executive officers have to achieve the respective levels of ownership within a phase-in period consisting of five years from the date such executive officer attains their respective position. As of December 31, 2018, every NEO is either in compliance with the guidelines or within the phase-in period. 
      Management Development and Compensation Committee's Use of Consultants and Consultant's Independence         
        The Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has responsibility for approving the compensation programs for our NEOs and acts pursuant to a charter that has been approved by our Board and is available through the Corporate Governance link on the Investor Relations page of the Aptar website located at: investors.aptar.com. Under this charter, the Management Development and Compensation Committee has the authority to retain outside advisers as deemed necessary, and in 2018 the Management Development and Compensation Committee retained Willis Towers Watson, a  Table of Contents global human resources consulting firm. The Management Development and Compensation Committee has determined that Willis Towers Watson is independent according to the advisor independence factors outlined by the NYSE. In making this independence determination, the Management Development and Compensation Committee recognized that Willis Towers Watson provides other services to the Company. The Management Development and Compensation Committee determined that the nature of these other services, described below, together with protocols implemented by Willis Towers Watson, did not give rise to any conflict of interest.

PRSUs in connection with 2018 LTI grants were granted to Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn, Schaffer and Touya on February 28, 2018. Amounts shown in the column regarding PRSUs do not reflect dollar amounts actually received by the NEOs. Instead, these amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the TSR portion of PRSUs granted in the year indicated computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value of the PRSUs is determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted payoffs of a share-based payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under ASC Topic 718, while the grant date fair value of the ROIC portion of the PRSUs is determined based on the probable  Table of Contents satisfaction of the performance conditions at the time of grant and the closing stock price on such date in accordance with ASC Topic 718.

[END TABLE]
The amounts included in the Stock Awards column for the PRSUs granted during 2018 are calculated based on the probable satisfaction of the performance conditions for such awards as of the date of grant. Assuming the highest level of performance is achieved for the portion of the PRSUs relating to the ROIC component, the maximum grant date fair value for the ROIC component would be as follows: Mr. Tanda—$1,297,842; Mr. Kuhn—$422,957; Mr. Schaffer—$392,464; and Mr. Touya—$386,742. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the vesting condition related to the TSR portion of the PRSUs is considered a market condition and not a performance condition. Accordingly, there is no grant date fair value below or in excess of the amount reflected in the table above for the NEOs that could be calculated and disclosed based on achievement of the underlying market condition. Assumptions used in the calculation of the expense related to the stock awards can be found in Note 16, "Stock-Based Compensation" to Aptar's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in Aptar's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019 ("Aptar's Financial Statements").   Table of Contents automobile for all NEOs. The amount of other compensation in 2018 for Mr. Tanda includes payments for moving expenses of approximately $265,000, compensation related to forfeited long term incentive plan amounts upon his employment at Aptar of approximately $1,218,000 and payable in accordance with his employment agreement and approximately $28,000 related to Company provided disability insurance. The amounts included for moving expenses are valued on the basis of the amounts paid directly to Mr. Tanda or the service provider, as applicable. The amount of other compensation in 2018 for Mr. Touya includes Company contributions related to a profit share program of approximately $23,000. The amount of other compensation for Ms. Gong includes payments for Company provided auto of approximately $14,000, housing of approximately $19,000 and approximately $39,000 related to dependent schooling.

      EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS       
   Tanda Employment Agreement  
        Mr. Tanda's employment agreement provides for employment through December 31, 2020, unless earlier terminated, at a minimum salary of $1,071,000 (which is the 2019 salary approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee) per year, which amount may be increased (but not decreased) over the term of the agreement. The employment agreement automatically extends for one additional year each January 1st, unless terminated, but may not be extended beyond December 31, 2030. In recognition of the fact that Mr. Tanda forfeited certain equity awards provided to him by his former employer, his Employment Agreement provides for the payment of the cash value of such awards scheduled to vest in 2017, 2018 and 2019, subject to Mr. Tanda's continued employment with the Company on the respective scheduled vesting dates. 
        If Mr. Tanda's employment ends on account of death, Mr. Tanda's estate will receive one-half of the base salary that Mr. Tanda would have received until the second anniversary of his death. If his employment ends due to the expiration of the employment agreement as a result of non-renewal by Aptar, Mr. Tanda is entitled to receive an amount equal to one year's base salary, his target annual performance incentive and the medical, disability and life insurance benefits he would have otherwise received for a period of one year following the expiration date. If Mr. Tanda is terminated without "cause," he is entitled to receive 1.5 times (i) his base salary then in effect and (ii) the greater of (x) his target annual performance incentive for the year in which he was terminated and (y) the average of the annual performance incentives paid to him for the two preceding years, paid in 18 equal monthly installments, as well as the medical, disability and life insurance benefits he would have otherwise received for a period of 18 months following the termination date. 
        After a "change in control" (as defined in the employment agreement), if Mr. Tanda's employment is terminated by Aptar or its successor other than for "cause," disability or death, or if Mr. Tanda terminates his employment for "good reason," in each case within two years following the change in control, Mr. Tanda is entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to (i) three times his highest annualized salary during the 12 month period preceding the termination and (ii) three times the average of the annual performance incentives in respect of the three years immediately preceding the year in which the change in control occurs, plus a prorated annual performance incentive equal to an amount at least equal to the average of the annual performance incentives in respect of the three years immediately preceding the year in which the change in control occurs, as well as the continuation of medical, disability and life insurance benefits for three years. 
        The employment agreement also contains certain noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants prohibiting Mr. Tanda from, among other things, becoming employed by a competitor of Aptar for a period of 18 months or two years following termination (depending on the nature of the termination).  Table of Contents
   Employment Agreements of Other NEOs  
        The employment agreements of Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong have a term of three (3) years, and provide (i) for automatic extensions, as of each January 1st commencing January 1, 2019, for one additional year unless either Aptar or the executive terminates such automatic extension by written notice to the other party at least 30 days prior to the automatic extension date, but in no event will continue later than December 31st of the year in which the executive turns 65 and (ii) that Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong will receive minimum annual salaries of $600,000, $550,000, and $450,000 respectively (which are the 2019 salaries that were approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee). These annual salaries may be increased (but not decreased) over the remaining terms of the agreements. In addition to participation in executive benefit programs on the same basis as other executives, Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong are entitled to additional term life and supplementary long-term disability insurance coverage. 
        If the employment of Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong ends on account of death, the executive's estate will receive one-half of the annual salary that the executive would have received until the second anniversary of the executive's death. If the employment of Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong ends due to the expiration of the agreement, the executive is entitled to receive an amount equal to one year's base salary (based on the salary then in effect) and medical and life insurance benefits the executive would have otherwise received for a period of one year following the expiration date. If Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong terminates the agreement without "good reason" (as defined in the agreement), the executive is not entitled to payments or benefits under the employment agreement (other than certain accrued amounts and plan benefits which by their terms extend beyond termination of employment). If Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the agreement), the executive is entitled to receive the executive's base salary then in effect (at the times it would have been paid) until the date on which the agreement was scheduled to expire. 
        After a change in control of Aptar, if Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong are terminated by Aptar or its successor other than for cause, disability or death, or if Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer or Ms. Gong terminates the executive's employment for "good reason," in each case within two years following the change in control, Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment equal to (x) two and one-half times the executive's highest annualized salary during the 12 month period preceding the termination and (y) two and one-half times the average of the annual performance incentives in respect of the three fiscal years of Aptar immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the change in control occurs, plus a prorated annual performance incentive equal to an amount at least equal to the average of the annual performance incentives in respect of the three fiscal years of Aptar immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the change in control occurs, as well as the continuation of medical, disability, and life insurance benefits for two and one-half years. 
        The employment agreement of Mr. Touya is in accordance with the French Collective Bargaining Agreement of the Plastics Industry. The agreement of Mr. Touya remains in effect for an unlimited period; however, the Company and Mr. Touya have the right to terminate  Table of Contents the agreement according to local law. The agreement provides for minimum annual salary to Mr. Touya of $555,500 (which is the 2019 local currency salary approved by the Management Development and Compensation Committee translated using the December 31, 2018 exchange rate). The agreement contains certain noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants prohibiting Mr. Touya from, among other things, becoming employed by a competitor of Aptar for a period of two years following termination (regardless of the reason for termination except for gross misconduct) and that Mr. Touya will receive payments as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment." 
        For information regarding termination benefits, including benefits provided pursuant to employment agreements with the NEOs, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment." 
      PENSION BENEFITS       
   U.S. Employees  
        Substantially all of the U.S. employees of Aptar and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Aptar Pension Plan. Employees are eligible to participate after six months of credited service and become fully vested after five years of credited service. The annual benefit payable to an employee under the Pension Plan upon retirement is computed as a straight life annuity equal to the sum of the separate amounts the employee accrues for each of his or her years of credited service under the Plan. Such separate amounts are determined as follows: for each year of credited service through 1988, 1.2% of such year's compensation up to the Social Security wage base for such year and 1.8% (2% for years after 1986) of such year's compensation above such wage base, plus certain increases put into effect prior to 1987; for each year after 1988 through the year in which the employee reaches 35 years of service, 1.2% of such year's "Covered Compensation" and 1.85% of such year's compensation above such "Covered Compensation" and for each year thereafter, 1.2% of such year's compensation. The employee's compensation under the Pension Plan for any year includes all salary, commissions and overtime pay and, beginning in 1989, annual performance incentives, subject to such year's limit applicable to tax-qualified retirement plans. The employee's "Covered Compensation" under the Pension Plan for any year is generally the average of the Social Security wage base for each of the 35 years preceding the employee's Social Security retirement age, assuming that such year's Social Security wage base will not change in the future. Normal retirement under the Pension Plan is age 65 and reduced benefits are available as early as age 55 provided that the employee has completed 10 years of service. If an employee has completed 10 years of service and elects to retire and receive pension benefits before age 65, the benefit will be calculated in the same manner as under normal retirement conditions, but will be permanently reduced for each month the benefit commences prior to age 65. The reduction factors are: 1/180 for each of the first 60 months, and 1/360 for each additional month that is in advance of the normal retirement age. Benefits are not subject to reduction for Social Security benefits or other offset items. 
        U.S. employees of Aptar and its subsidiaries participating in the Pension Plan are also eligible for Aptar's non-qualified supplemental retirement plan ("SERP"). The annual benefit payable to an employee under the SERP upon retirement is computed as a straight life  Table of Contents annuity equal to the sum of the separate amounts the employee accrues for each of his or her years of credited service under the SERP. The annual accrued benefits are determined as follows: for each year of credited service through the year in which the participant reaches 35 years of service, 1.85% of the participant's "Supplemental Earnings;" and for each year after 35 years of credited service, 1.2% of such year's "Supplemental Earnings." "Supplemental Earnings" is generally the difference between (i) the participant's earnings calculated as if the limitation of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code were not in effect and (ii) the participant's recognized earnings under the Pension Plan. Participants who terminate service prior to being eligible for retirement (i.e., age 65 or age 55 with 10 years of credited service) will forfeit all accrued benefits under the SERP. The SERP provides for the vesting of all accrued benefits to those not already retirement eligible under the plan in the event of a change of control. 
        Mr. Touya is a resident of Europe and does not participate in the U.S. pension benefit plans, but as described below, is entitled to other pension benefits. 
   Non-U.S. Employees  
        Mr. Touya is entitled to certain retirement indemnity benefits in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement of the French Plastics Industry ("Collective Pension"). Such benefits are based on a formula that takes salary and years of service into consideration. In addition, Mr. Touya is eligible for benefits pursuant to a supplemental pension plan available to certain French executives ("Supplemental Pension"). This plan provides participants with an annual pension compensation for life, subject to cost of living adjustments, of up to 10% of the average annual salary and bonus paid to a participant in the five years preceding retirement, the total of the amounts received by the employee according to the Collective Pension and the Supplemental Pension being subject to a ceiling equal to 55% of the average annual salary and bonus paid to a participant in the five years preceding retirement. In the event of a participant's death after retirement, the plan provides a surviving spouse with annual payments of 60% of the participant's Supplemental Pension for life. Pension benefits would normally commence at age 67, which is the legal retirement age in France, but reduced benefits are available after age 62 if the employment contract is terminated by the company after age 57.

   Normal Expiration of Employment Agreement  
        As a condition to the employment agreements of Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn, and Schaffer and Ms. Gong each would receive his/her current base salary amount as well as benefits currently provided, including current health and welfare benefits (consisting of health and term life premiums) for a period of one year following the normal expiration date of his/her agreement. Amounts would be paid and benefits would be provided on a monthly basis for twelve months. With expiration within the first five (5) years of his start date, Mr. Tanda is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the present value of any qualified pension benefits he would lose in connection with such termination. Mr. Tanda would also receive his target annual performance incentive for the year in which he was terminated due to expiration of his employment agreement, paid on a monthly basis for the 12 months following the termination. The employment agreement of Mr. Touya has no expiration date. 
   Voluntary or With Cause Termination  
        Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong are not entitled to additional benefits if they voluntarily terminate their employment prior to the normal expiration of their respective agreements or they are terminated with cause. With voluntary termination within the first five (5) years of his start date, Mr. Tanda is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the present value of any qualified pension benefits he would lose in connection with such termination. With voluntary termination, Mr. Touya may receive monthly payments in accordance with the non-competition clauses of his contracts equal to 50% of his former monthly salary for a period of two years from the date of termination. Such payments would not be made in the event of a termination with cause, generally defined as gross misconduct. Equity awards and Outperformance awards granted to NEOs continue to vest upon retirement (and in the case of PRSUs and Outperformance awards, are paid on a pro-rated performance period). For a description of the value of outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2018, see the second paragraph under "Involuntary or Good Reason Termination After a Change in Control" below.  Table of Contents
   Involuntary Termination  
        For Messrs. Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong amounts shown above represent their base salaries, annual performance incentive amounts and amounts paid in connection with Outperformance awards. Amounts would be paid on a monthly basis for the remaining term of each respective agreement. If Mr. Tanda is terminated without "cause," he is entitled to receive 1.5 times (i) his base salary then in effect and (ii) the greater of (x) his target annual performance incentive for the year in which he was terminated and (y) the average of the annual performance incentives paid to him for the two preceding years, paid in 18 equal installments, as well as the medical, disability and life insurance benefits he would have otherwise received for a period of 18 months following the termination date. Termination of Mr. Tanda within the first five (5) years of his start date, would also entitle Mr. Tanda to a lump sum payment equal to the present value of any qualified pension benefits he would lose in connection with such termination. Cash payment amounts shown for Mr. Touya represent payments that would be required under the Collective Bargaining Agreement of the French Plastics Industry and monthly payments in accordance with the non-competition clauses of his respective contracts equal to 50% of his former monthly salary for a period of two years from the date of termination. The Collective Bargaining Agreement of the French Plastics Industry provides for an indemnity to be paid upon involuntary termination of employment that is based on the number of years of service and on the average monthly total compensation paid during the last twelve months ("Monthly Salary"). This indemnity is equal to 4.4 times the Monthly Salary in total for the first 13 years of service plus 0.5 times the Monthly Salary for each year thereafter. Except as described below, no payments would be made in connection with PRSUs regarding an involuntary termination. 
        For Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer and Touya if they are terminated without cause or, with respect to a retiree-eligible participant, retire upon learning that they will be terminated without cause, the 2017 Retention Awards vest immediately on the date of termination or retirement, as applicable. 
   Involuntary or Good Reason Termination After a Change in Control ("CIC")  
        Cash payment amounts shown for Mr. Tanda represent, according to his employment agreements and the CIC provisions therein, three times his highest annualized salary during the 12-month period preceding the termination and three times the average of his annual performance incentive amounts earned or payable in the past three fiscal years, as well as a prorated annual performance incentive. The cash payment amounts shown for Messrs. Kuhn, Schaffer and Touya and Ms. Gong represent, according to their employment agreements and the CIC provisions therein, two and one-half times their highest annualized salary during the 12 month period preceding the termination and two and one-half times the average of their annual performance incentive amounts earned or payable in the past three fiscal years, as well as a prorated annual performance incentive. Cash payments under this scenario would be lump sum payments that would be expected to be paid within approximately 30 days following the date of termination. The employment agreement of Mr. Tanda also provides for the continuation of health and welfare benefits currently provided, for a period of three years following the date of termination. The agreements of Messrs. Kuhn, Haffar, Schaffer and Touya and Ms. Gong also provide for the continuation of health and welfare benefits  Table of Contents currently provided, for a period of two and one-half years following the date of termination. Cash payment amounts shown for Mr. Touya are identical to the payments described above under "Involuntary Termination" in accordance with his agreements. 
        Aptar's employee stock option and RSU agreements, PRSU agreements and the Outperformance TSR Plan, provide for the acceleration of vesting upon a CIC. The amounts shown represent the value of unvested stock options and the market value of RSUs as of December 31, 2018. The Outperformance award amounts are based on Aptar's actual relative TSR compared to the S&P 400 MidCap Index for 2018. The PRSUs amounts are based on a maximum payout under the PRSU award and is prorated based on one third of the completed performance period. Further information regarding unvested stock options, RSUs and PRSUs can be found under "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End." The accelerated stock option values included in the above table represent the difference between the closing price of Aptar's common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018 ("Closing Price") which was $94.07 per share, and the exercise prices of the respective unvested stock options multiplied by the number of unvested stock options. The accelerated RSU values included in the above table represent the Closing Price multiplied by the number of unvested RSUs. 
   Disability  
        The employment agreements of Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong provide for payments equal to a minimum of approximately 66.67% of their base salary while they are disabled, until they reach the age of 65. A portion of the payments are covered under insurance policies paid for by Aptar. The cash payment amounts included in the above table for Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong represent one year of disability payments under this scenario. In addition, Aptar's employee stock option, RSU agreements and PRSU agreements provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of disability. Further information regarding the value of accelerated equity grants shown in the above table can be found in the preceding paragraph. 
   Death  
        Upon death, the employment agreements of Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong provide their estates with one-half of their annual salary that they would have received until the second anniversary of their death. Aptar's employee stock option, RSU agreements and PRSU agreements provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of death and the values shown in the table above for this scenario are the same as those shown under the Disability and Involuntary or Good Reason Termination After a CIC scenarios. 
   CIC without Termination  
        The named executive officers are not entitled to additional benefits if there is a CIC without termination within two years of the CIC event other than the acceleration of equity award and Outperformance award vesting.  Table of Contents
   Non-compete Information  
        The agreements of Messrs. Tanda, Kuhn and Schaffer and Ms. Gong require that during the employment period and for one year thereafter in the case of either termination for good reason following a CIC or termination without cause, or for two years following termination for any other reason, that each executive will not (i) compete directly or indirectly with the Company or (ii) solicit employees or customers of the Company. The agreement of Mr. Touya requires that, for a period of two years following termination, he will not (i) compete directly or indirectly with the Company or (ii) solicit employees or customers of the Company, and that under this arrangement, he will receive monthly payments equal to 50% of his former monthly salary for a period of two years from the date of termination. Payments would not be made to Mr. Touya if he was terminated with cause, defined as gross misconduct. 
   Pension Related Benefits  
        Information concerning pension benefits can be found under the heading "Pension Benefits."  Table of Contents 
      CEO PAY RATIO       
        As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Aptar is providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees to the annual total compensation of Stephan Tanda, our President and CEO. To better understand this disclosure, we think it is important to give context to our operations. As a global organization, approximately 81% of our employees are located outside of the United States, with approximately 7,300 employees located in Europe and 2,500 employees located in Asia and South America. We strive to create a competitive global compensation program in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which the employee is located. As a result, our compensation program varies amongst each local market in order to allow us to provide a competitive compensation package. 
   Pay Ratio 
        For 2018:
   Supplemental Ratio 
   Identification of Median Employee  
        For purposes of the foregoing CEO pay ratio disclosure, we were required to identify the "median employee" of our worldwide workforce, without regard to their location, compensation arrangements or employment status (full-time versus part-time) and then determine the annual total compensation that "median employee" earned during 2018. We first determined our "median employee" during 2017 for purposes of determining our CEO  Table of Contents pay ratio for that year (our "2017 CEO Pay Ratio") by identifying the employee whose compensation was at the median of the compensation of our employee population (other than our CEO) for 2017. The applicable SEC rules require us to identify a "median employee" only once every three years, as long as there have been no material changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our CEO pay ratio disclosure. Because there have been no material changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the Company's CEO pay ratio disclosure, we are using the same "median employee" for our 2018 CEO Pay Ratio that we used for our 2017 CEO Pay Ratio, although we have updated the calculation of the total compensation earned by that employee for 2018. 
        For the 2017 Pay Ratio, we used the following methodology:  Table of Contents

      TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS       
        Aptar or one of our subsidiaries may occasionally enter into transactions with certain "related persons." Related persons include our executive officers, directors, nominees for directors, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock and immediate family members of these persons. We refer to transactions involving amounts in excess of $120,000 and in which the related person has a direct or indirect material interest as "related person transactions." Each related person transaction must be approved or ratified in accordance with Aptar's written Related Person Transactions Policy by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Each member of the Audit Committee is considered a "disinterested" director and therefore are approving related person transactions from this perspective. 
        The Audit Committee considers all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related person transaction including, without limitation, the following:
        The following are not considered related person transactions:
        Pursuant to this policy, the Audit Committee approves or ratifies all related person transactions, including those involving NEOs and directors. Since January 1, 2018, there have been no related person transactions for which disclosure is required under SEC rules. 
     SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE       
        Based solely upon a review of reports and written representations furnished to it, Aptar believes that during 2018 all filings with the SEC by its executive officers and directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of its common stock complied with requirements for reporting ownership and changes in ownership of Aptar's common stock pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

      AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT       
        Management is responsible for Aptar's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of Aptar's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including the effectiveness of internal controls, and issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for overseeing the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of Aptar. 
        During the course of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, management completed the documentation, testing and evaluation of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the requirements set forth in Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Management and the independent registered public accounting firm kept the Audit Committee apprised of the progress of the documentation, testing and evaluation through periodic updates, and the Audit Committee provided advice to management during this process. 
        The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and the SEC. 
        In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and letter from the independent registered public accounting firm as required by the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from Aptar and Aptar's management. In considering the independence of Aptar's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee took into consideration the amount and nature of the fees paid to this firm for non-audit services as described under "Proposal 3—Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019". 
        Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Aptar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.
