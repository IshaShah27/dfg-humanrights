PROXY STATEMENT
For
ANNUAL MEETING OF LIMITED PARTNERS
To Be Held on May 15, 2019
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to holders of common units in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Managers for use at the Dorchester Minerals, L.P. 2019 Annual Meeting. Our general partner is Dorchester Minerals Management LP, and its general partner is Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC. As a result, the Board of Managers of Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC exercises effective control of us. Dorchester Minerals Management LP is referred to herein as our general partner, and Dorchester Minerals Management GP LLC is referred to herein as the general partner of our general partner. The approximate date on which definitive copies of this proxy statement and form of proxy are intended to be released to Unitholders is April 4, 2019.
When and Where Is the 2019 Annual Meeting?
The 2019 Annual Meeting will be held at 2:00 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, May 15, 2019, at the office of Thompson & Knight LLP, One Arts Plaza, 1722 Routh Street, Suite 1500, Dallas, TX 75201.
What Are The Board of Managers' Proposals?
To elect three managers who will serve on the Board of Managers and be appointed to the Advisory Committee and to approve the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
How Does the Board of Managers Recommend I Vote on the Proposals?
The Board of Managers recommends a vote FOR each of the nominees to serve on the Board of Managers and the Advisory Committee and a vote FOR the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
How Will Voting On Any Other Business Be Conducted?
The Board of Managers does not know of any business to be considered at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. However, if any other business is properly presented, your signed proxy card gives authority to the persons named in the proxy to vote on such matters at their discretion.
Who Is Entitled to Vote?
Each Unitholder as of the close of business on March 21, 2019, the record date, is entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
How Many Units May Be Voted?
As of the record date, 32,279,774 units were outstanding. Each unit entitles its holder to one vote.
What is a "Quorum"?
A quorum is established if a majority of the outstanding units are represented in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting. There must be a quorum for the 2019 Annual Meeting to be held. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, you will be considered part of the quorum. Proxies received by us that are marked "withhold authority" or abstain, or that constitute a broker non-vote, are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker returns a valid proxy but does not vote on a particular matter because the broker does not have the discretionary voting power for that matter and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.
What Vote Is Required to Approve the Proposals?
The affirmative vote of holders of a plurality of the outstanding units is required to elect each manager to the Board of Managers. Thus, any abstentions, broker non-votes or other limited proxies will have no effect on the outcome of the election of managers. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the units present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our registered independent public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Abstentions will have the effect of votes against the proposal to approve Grant Thornton LLP as our independent public accounting firm, but broker non-votes and other limited proxies will have no effect on this proposal.
How Do I Vote?
You may vote by any one of three different methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     (a)   In Writing - You can vote by marking, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed envelope. If you return your signed proxy card, but do not give instructions as to how you wish to vote, your units will be voted FOR proposal nos. 1, 2 and 3.  
     (b)   By Telephone - You can vote by calling the telephone number on the proxy card and following the instructions. Please have the proxy card in hand when calling.  
     (c)   In Person - You can vote by attending the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Units represented by properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions shown on the proxy card. You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the 2019 Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     (a)   Delivering to Dorchester Minerals, L.P., Attn: 2019 Annual Meeting, 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas, 75219-4541, a written revocation;  
     (b)   Voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting; or;  
     (c)   Returning a later-dated proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
Attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting will not, without further action by you, revoke your proxy.
Unitholders have no dissenters' rights or rights of appraisal under Delaware law or our Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"). 
What Does It Mean If I Receive More Than One Proxy Card?
If your units are registered differently and/or are in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please mark, sign, date, and return all of the proxy cards you receive to ensure that all of your units are voted. We encourage you to have all accounts registered in the same name and address (whenever possible). You can accomplish this by contacting our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, at (800) 937-5449.
How Can I Vote If My Units Are Held in "Street Name"?
If your units are held in the name of your broker, a bank, or other nominee, that party will give you instructions about how to vote your units.
Who Will Count the Votes?
Representatives of Broadridge Investor Communication Services, an independent tabulator, will count the votes and act as the inspector of election.
Where and When Will I Be Able to Find Out the Results of Voting?
In addition to announcing the results at the 2019 Annual Meeting, you will also be able to find the results in our Form 8-K that will be publicly filed within four business days of the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Who Is Bearing the Cost Of This Proxy Solicitation?
This proxy solicitation by the Partnership is being made by the Partnership on behalf of the Board of Managers. We are bearing the cost of soliciting proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting. In addition to using the mail, managers, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, personal interview or otherwise. Our managers, officers and employees will not receive additional compensation for this activity but may be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to Unitholders.
How Can I Obtain A Copy of the Annual Report on Form 10-K?
A copy of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements filed therewith is included with this proxy statement. We will provide an additional copy of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements, upon written request to Dorchester Minerals, L.P., Attn: 2019 Annual Meeting, 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75219-4541. We will furnish a requesting Unitholder with any exhibit not contained therein upon payment of a reasonable fee.
When Are the Unitholder Proposals For the 2020 Annual Meeting of Limited Partners Due?
We presently expect that our next Annual Meeting of Limited Partners will be held on May 13, 2020. Unitholder proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received at our principal executive office at 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75219-4541, addressed to our general partner no later than December 6, 2019. In accordance with our Partnership Agreement, Unitholders who intend to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting without inclusion of such proposal in our proxy materials are required to provide notice of such proposal to us no later than March 14, 2020, and Unitholders who intend to nominate a manager for election to the Board of Managers and Advisory Committee are required to provide notice of such proposal to us no later than February 13, 2020. If the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is changed to a different month, we will advise our Unitholders of the new date for the submission of Unitholder proposals in one of our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Who should I contact if I have questions or need assistance voting my units?
If you have more questions about the proposals, need assistance voting your units or if you would like additional copies of this document you should call or write:

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our managers, officers and persons who own more than 10% of our common units to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common units. Managers, officers and 10% holders of the common units are required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and representations that no other reports were required, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our managers, officers and 10% holders were met.
PARTNERSHIP GOVERNANCE
Our business and affairs are managed by and under the direction of the Board of Managers, which exercises all of our corporate powers and establishes broad corporate policies. The leadership of the Board of Managers is vested in the Chairman. In May 2015, the Board of Managers appointed Mr. McManemin, who also serves as our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), to be the Chairman of the Board of Managers. The Board of Managers does not have a Lead Independent Manager. However, the Board of Managers believes that this leadership structure is appropriate for the partnership, because our Chief Executive Officer has extensive day-to-day knowledge of the partnership's operations and effectively facilitates information flow between management and the Board of Managers and the Advisory Committee, which are essential to effective governance.
The Board of Managers consists of five managers appointed by the five members of the general partner of our general partner and three additional managers nominated by these members and elected annually by our limited partners. The elected managers, as a group, must meet the requirements of our Partnership Agreement and the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ ") rules for members of an audit committee.
Messrs. Allen, McManemin, Raley and Vaughn and Ms. Rochelle are the five managers appointed by the members of the general partner of our general partner and will hold office until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal from office. In the event of any vacancy on the Board of Managers left by an appointed manager, the member who holds the right to appoint the appointed manager will designate the replacement appointed manager, unless the member who otherwise holds the right to appoint the replacement appointed manager has lost his appointment right.
Messrs. Lassiter, Russell and Trout are the three managers who were elected at our 2018 Annual Meeting and are the three managers nominated by the members of the general partner of our general partner to stand for election to the Board of Managers at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
In the opinion of the Board of Managers, and as "independent" currently is defined by the NASDAQ rules, and assuming the three nominated managers are elected by the limited partners at the 2019 Annual Meeting, a majority of the Board of Managers after the 2019 Annual Meeting are and will be independent of management and free of any relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment. The Board of Managers has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Lassiter, Russell, Trout and Vaughn and Ms. Rochelle are independent. In addition to the NASDAQ "independence" rules, the Board of Managers has also affirmatively determined that Messrs. Lassiter, Russell and Trout also satisfy the definition of "independent" prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for members of an audit committee.
The Board of Managers held 8 meetings and acted by unanimous written consent 4 times in fiscal 2018. Each Manager attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Managers and of the committees of the Board of Managers on which such Manager served.
The Board of Managers strongly recommends each manager attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of our limited partners. Seven of the eight managers currently serving attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
The Board of Managers has an Advisory Committee that consists of Messrs. Lassiter, Russell and Trout. The Advisory Committee functions as the audit committee and as the compensation committee. In addition, the Advisory Committee addresses all matters concerning conflicts of interest and the application of the Business Opportunities Agreement. The Advisory Committee acted by unanimous written consent two times in fiscal 2018 and held no special meetings.
The Board of Managers does not have a nominating committee or committee performing similar functions and has not adopted a resolution addressing the nominations process nor does it consider diversity with respect to manager nominees or have a diversity policy. This arrangement is appropriate as the nominations for all managers are made by the members of the general partner of our general partner. Messrs. McManemin, Raley, Allen and Vaughn and Ms. Rochelle all participate in the consideration of nominees for the Board of Managers in their capacities as officers and/or managers of the members of the general partner of our general partner. The Board of Managers has not adopted a resolution addressing the nominations process as the general partner of our general partner is legally required to provide its members with the ability to nominate managers.
The Board of Managers does provide a process for Unitholders to send communications to it. Unitholders may contact each member of the Board of Managers in writing at their respective business addresses. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management."
Our partnership adopted our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on July 17, 2003. The Board of Managers reviewed the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in 2018 for adequacy and was satisfied therewith. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all officers, managers, advisors, consultants and employees of our partnership and its affiliates. Upon written request, we will provide any person, without charge, a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Written requests should be sent to Dorchester Minerals, L.P., Attn: Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, 3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75219-4541.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE
In their service as the Audit Committee, the members of the Advisory Committee assist the Board of Managers in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to our consolidated financial statements and other financial information; compliance with applicable laws, regulations and our code of conduct; independence and qualifications of the independent auditor; management's establishment of and adherence to a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls; and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. The Advisory Committee is empowered to investigate any matter brought to its attention with full access to all our books, records, facilities and personnel and may retain outside counsel, auditors or other experts to assist it. Our Board of Managers has adopted a written charter for the Advisory Committee in its service as the Audit Committee specifying its purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes, a copy of which can be obtained free of charge on our website at www.dmlp.net. The charter is reviewed periodically to ensure that it meets all applicable legal and NASDAQ listing requirements. As interpreted in the Board of Managers' business judgment, assuming the three nominated managers are elected by the limited partners at the 2019 Annual Meeting, each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and possess accounting or related financial management expertise and are "audit committee financial experts" as described in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. None of the members of the Advisory Committee has participated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in the previous three years.
We administer our risk oversight function through our Advisory Committee as well as through our Board of Managers as a whole. Our Advisory Committee is empowered to monitor the integrity of our financial reporting processes and systems of internal controls and provide an avenue of communication among our independent auditors, management, employees overseeing our internal audit functions and our Board of Managers. Additionally, reports are provided during our board meetings by the individuals who oversee risk management in liquidity, environmental, safety, litigation, cybersecurity and other operational areas.
In their service as the Compensation Committee, the members of the Advisory Committee exercise the power of the Board of Managers in connection with all matters relating to compensation of executive officers who are also members of our Board of Managers. All determinations concerning executive compensation for such officers are made by the Advisory Committee as provided in our agreements of the general partner and the general partner of our general partner. Advisor compensation is approved by the Board of Managers. Because of the simple remuneration for the services of our officers and managers, the Advisory Committee does not delegate or use consultants in determining and considering amounts or form of compensation and has not adopted a Compensation Committee charter.
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This following discussion gives a background of compensation paid by Dorchester Minerals Operating LP, the operating partnership controlled by our general partner, and addresses the operating partnership's compensation-setting process and philosophy, the components of named executive officer compensation and the Advisory Committee's decisions for compensation earned by our named executive officers who are also members of our Board of Managers in 2018. Our named executive officers in 2018 were William Casey McManemin, Leslie A. Moriyama and Bradley J. Ehrman.
Background
Our partnership does not have any employees, nor does it pay any of the operating partnership's employees, including our named executive officers, for their services, however, our named executive officers generally serve in the same capacities for the operating partnership and are compensated by the operating partnership for their service in those capacities. Such compensation is borne indirectly by us only to the extent of our obligation to reimburse the operating partnership for certain general and administrative expenses, subject to the limitation on reimbursement. It is possible that our partnership would not be obligated to reimburse the operating partnership for its compensation expenses including the salaries of our named executive officers in certain circumstances.
Each of our Appointed Managers is associated with one or more of the members of our general partner. The owners of our general partner may receive a portion of the cash flow generated by our activities and those of the operating partnership. One of our Appointed Managers, Mr. McManemin, also serves as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Appointed Managers' participation in our partnership's results are limited to distributions from the owners of the general partner and their individual holdings of publicly traded units in our partnership, if any.
Compensation Setting Process
With limited exception, our CEO has broad discretion to establish the composition and amount of compensation for the employees of the operating partnership, including the named executive officers with the Advisory Committee approving the CEO's compensation. Employee compensation includes salary, insurance benefits (including medical, dental, vision, life, and disability coverage), a SEP-IRA program, and discretionary merit bonuses awarded in the form of cash or DMLP units. The CEO consults with senior management (including the CFO and COO) and department managers no less frequently than annually to assess employee performance, attitude and collaboration when determining compensation. Compensation levels are to some extent impacted by the formulaic limitations on general and administrative expense reimbursement set forth in our partnership agreement.
The CEO annually reports to the Board of Managers on compensation matters including proposed salary and benefits. The Advisory committee is required to approve compensation for any employee who is also a member of the Board of Managers. Since our formation in 2003, Mr. McManemin's compensation has been subject to the approval of the Advisory Committee. The compensation of Ms. Moriyama and Mr. Ehrman is determined by Mr. McManemin.
Compensation Philosophy
The Advisory Committee and CEO believe in rewarding our named executive officers based on individual performance as well as aligning the interests of our named executive officers with those of our common unitholders. The CEO and the Advisory Committee believe our compensation package (including salaries, insurance benefits, SEP-IRA program and discretionary merit bonuses) of our employees including our named executive officers are appropriate and sufficient to attract, retain, incentivize and properly reward our employees.
Elements and Objectives of Compensation
Salary and Discretionary Cash Bonuses. Our CEO determines employee salaries and discretionary cash bonuses, in consultation with senior management including the CFO and the COO and from time to time the Advisory Committee. The operating partnership does not have a formulaic salary schedule or bonus plan. The CEO has broad discretion to consider a wide range of factors in determining compensation including but not limited to performance, loyalty, collaboration and attitude. The CEO and the Advisory Committee do not benchmark compensation but consider the operating partnership and the named executive officers' compensation to be appropriate. The objective of our salary determinations is to attract and retain our named executive officers with the goal of retaining long-term unitholder value, and the objective of discretionary cash bonuses is to reward the efforts of our named executive officers on the basis of their annual performance.
Equity Awards. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the Dorchester Minerals Operating LP Equity Incentive Program (the "Equity Incentive Program") and are eligible to receive common unit awards granted by Dorchester Minerals Operating GP LLC, the administrator of the Equity Incentive Program. In determining the number of common units to be awarded to the CFO and COO, the CEO takes into account the named executive officer's position, scope of responsibility and value creation in the Partnership.
Determination of 2018 Compensation
Mr. McManemin. The Advisory Committee maintained the salary of Mr. McManemin at $96,000 per year during 2018. This decision was in recognition of the service he provides in managing the day-to-day affairs necessary to our partnership and the operating partnership. This arrangement has been in place since the partnership began operations on January 31, 2003, and Mr. McManemin has received the same $96,000 annual salary since then. Mr. McManemin did not receive a cash bonus or any equity awards during 2018. Given his respective ownership interests in the general partner of our general partner and holdings of common units, the Board of Managers and the Advisory Committee believe that he is adequately compensated and aligned with common unitholder interests.
Ms. Moriyama. As our Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Moriyama's base salary is $185,436 per year, based on our CEO's subjective determination of the appropriate salary for someone with her business and financial experience in the oil and gas industry. Ms. Moriyama received a cash bonus of $56,000, and a common unit award under the Equity Incentive Program of 3,500 common units during 2018.
Mr. Ehrman. As our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Ehrman's base salary is $200,889 per year, based on his level of education and extensive history of managing the properties held by our partnership. Mr. Ehrman received a cash bonus of $70,000, and a common unit award under the Equity Incentive Program of 4,000 common units during 2018.
Both Ms. Moriyama and Mr. Ehrman's cash bonus and common unit awards were determined by the CEO based on a subjective assessment of the applicable executive's business impact, including value creation, leadership and teamwork, among other factors.
Response to Say-on-Pay Vote
The Advisory Committee and the Board of Managers considered the results of our most recent unitholder advisory vote on executive compensation at our 2017 Annual Meeting. Our unitholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with over 96% of the common units present at the meeting voting in favor of such compensation. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee and the Board of Managers have not changed our executive compensation decisions and policies following the 2017 Annual Meeting.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer ("PEO") to the median employee's annual total compensation. Mr. William Casey McManemin is the Partnership's Chief Executive Officer. In the pay ratio table below, Mr. McManemin's total compensation as reflected in the foregoing Summary Compensation Table contained within this proxy statement, is compared to the median employee's total compensation. For simplicity, the value of the Partnership's retirement plan was excluded for Mr. McManemin and all permanent employees, as all employees, including the PEO, are offered the same benefits. In determining the median employee for the year ended December 31, 2018, a listing was prepared of all employees that were actively employed as of December 31, 2018, with the exception of Mr. McManemin. All wages, bonuses and stock awards paid to each employee were deemed to be the employee's total compensation. If a permanent employee was not employed by the Partnership for the entirety of the year, an annualized total compensation was calculated for that employee. This methodology is consistent with the methodology used in determining the median employee for the year ended December 31, 2017. The below table presents the ratio of median of the annual total compensation of all employees, except Mr. McManemin, to the annual total compensation of the Partnership's Principal Executive Officer:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Mr. William Casey McManemin (PEO) total annual compensation    $ 96,000   
 Median Employee total annual compensation    $ 116,925

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
In 2018, the Partnership and our wholly-owned subsidiaries reimbursed certain direct and indirect expenses to the operating partnership and our general partner. The reimbursements were made pursuant to the Partnership Agreement and Administrative Services Agreements or office lease agreements between the operating partnership and Dorchester Minerals Oklahoma LP or Maecenas Minerals, L.L.P., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership. No management fees or any other type of compensation is paid by or to any related party, other than compensation reported pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K.
Reimbursement of Our General Partner
Our general partner was reimbursed $948,797 for expenses incurred in 2018 pursuant to our Partnership Agreement. Our general partner is not compensated for services provided in acting as our general partner. However, we reimburse our general partner on a monthly basis for all expenses incurred or payments made on our behalf, and all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us. Such expenses include both direct expenses and management expenses. Pursuant to our Partnership Agreement, direct expenses include
[BEGIN TABLE]
● professional fees and expenses, such as audit, tax, legal and engineering costs;  
● regulatory fees and expenses;  
● ad valorem taxes;  
● severance taxes;  
● the fees and expenses of independent managers of our general partner and its general partner; and  
● premiums for officers' and managers' liability insurance;  
● expenses of the General Partner related to professional and regulatory matters.  
[END TABLE]
Management expenses are expenses of the general partner and its affiliates incurred on our behalf and include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● rent, wages, salaries and the cost of employee benefit plans provided to employees and officers that are properly allocable to us; and  
● all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to us but do not include items classified as direct expenses or production costs.  
[END TABLE]
As a result of the limitation on management expenses discussed below, recovery of additional expenses may occur by changing the classification of the expenses only to the extent that (i) a portion of management expense is reduced by shifting certain costs to direct expenses or production cost, and (ii) such classification change impacts a period when management expense could otherwise exceed the 5% cap and (iii) such excess above the cap cannot be recovered in future or past fiscal years.
Our reimbursements to our general partner of management expenses (excluding overhead expenses included in production costs that are deducted in determining net profits interests) during any fiscal year are limited to an amount not greater than 5% of the sum of our distributions to our partners for that fiscal year, adjusted for changes in cash reserves, plus expenses paid by us for that year for direct and management expenses and production costs which are capital in nature and charged against the net profits interests, and increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs.
To the extent that actual reimbursement for management expenses in any fiscal year is less than five percent (5%) of this sum, our reimbursement to our general partner may exceed the 5% limitation by the amount of that difference at any time during the succeeding three fiscal years. If reimbursement to our general partner was limited by the 5% limitation during the preceding three fiscal years, the amount by which the management expenses are less than the 5% limitation in the current year may be used to permit our general partner to recoup the deficit from the preceding years.
Our Partnership Agreement generally may not be amended to increase the 5% limitation on the reimbursement of management expenses unless approved by a majority of the Partnership's unitholders.
Reimbursement to the Operating Partnership
In 2018, the operating partnership was reimbursed an aggregate of $421,588 from Dorchester Minerals Oklahoma LP and Maecenas Minerals, L.L.P., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, pursuant to Administrative Service Agreements or office lease agreements. The operating partnership provided the wholly-owned subsidiaries services related to accounting, internal controls, management of data processing systems, preparation of all federal and state tax reports, service as paymaster, preparation of periodic financial statements and banking and other financial relationships. The operating partnership was reimbursed for the payment of all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred in the performance of the services provided, including without limitation, (i) attributable telephone, office rent and other office expenses, (ii) attributable salaries and other compensation expenses of employees, officers and directors, (iii) other attributable administrative expenses, (iv) travel expenses, (v) legal and accounting costs and expenses and (vi) expenses incurred in providing or obtaining such other professional, technical, administrative services and advice as deemed necessary or desirable. Reimbursements made pursuant to the Administrative Service Agreements were not also made pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
Whenever any potential conflict of interest exists or arises between our general partner or any of its affiliates and us or any of our partners, our general partner resolves that conflict. Our Partnership Agreement requires our general partner to seek approval of a majority of the members of the Advisory Committee of the general partner of our general partner as to a proposed resolution of the conflict. In addition to approval by the Advisory Committee the resolution of the conflict of interest must also be fair and reasonable to us. Any resolution of a conflict of interest shall also be conclusively deemed fair and reasonable to us if such resolution is:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or  
● fair to us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to us).  
[END TABLE]
Our general partner, or its general partner's Advisory Committee if its approval is sought, is authorized, in connection with its determination of what is fair and reasonable to us, and in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest, to consider:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest,  
● any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical dealings with a particular person,  
● any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles, and  
● such additional factors as our general partner's, or its general partner's Advisory Committee, determines in its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
Whenever our Partnership Agreement requires that a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict of interest be fair and reasonable, the fair and reasonable nature of that transaction, arrangement, or resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or related transactions.

Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting of Unitholders and will be given the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions. Although unitholder approval of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP is not required, the Board believes that it is appropriate to seek unitholder approval of this appointment. If the unitholders fail to approve the appointment, the Advisory Committee and the Board of Managers will consider whether or not to retain Grant Thornton LLP. Even if the appointment is approved, the Board of Managers, at its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interest and the best interests of our unitholders.
During 2018 and 2017, the Partnership incurred the following fees with Grant Thornton:

     (1)   Audit fees represent amounts billed for each of the periods presented for professional services rendered in connection with those services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements including comfort letters, consents and other services related to SEC matters.  
     (2)   Audit-related fees represent amounts billed in each of the years presented for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the annual audit or quarterly reviews.  
     (3)   Tax fees represent amounts billed in each of the years presented for professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.  
     (4)   All other fees represent amounts billed in each of the years presented for services not classifiable under the other categories listed in the table above  
[END TABLE]
The Advisory Committee has adopted procedures for pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by our independent auditor. Part of this approval process includes making a determination on whether non-audit services are consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on auditor independence. The Advisory Committee periodically monitors the services rendered and actual fees paid to the independent auditors to ensure such services are within the parameters approved.
Unless unitholders specify otherwise in the proxy, proxies solicited by the Board of Managers will be voted by the persons named in the proxy at the Annual Meeting of Unitholders to approve the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered accounting firm for 2019.
THE BOARD OF MANAGERS RECOMMENDS THAT UNITHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPOINTMENT OF GRANT THORNTON LLP.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board of Managers does not intend to present any other matters at the 2019 Annual Meeting and knows of no other matters that will be presented. However, if any other matters come before the 2019 Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters.
