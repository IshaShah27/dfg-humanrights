Shares Held by Brokers or Nominees 
If the shares you own are held in "street name" by a brokerage firm, your brokerage firm, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. In order to vote your shares, you will need to follow the directions your brokerage firm provides you. Many brokers also offer the option of providing voting instructions to them over the internet or by telephone, directions for which would be provided by your brokerage firm on your vote instruction form. 
Under stock exchange rules applicable to most brokerage firms, if you do not give instructions to your broker, it is permitted to vote any shares it holds for your account in its discretion with respect to "routine" proposals, but it is not allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain non-routine proposals. Proposal 1, regarding the election of directors is a "non-routine" proposal. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to Proposal 1, your broker will not vote on it and your shares will be recorded as "broker non-votes" and will not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 1. "Broker non-votes" are shares that are held in "street name" by a bank or brokerage firm that indicates on its proxy that, while voting in its discretion on one matter, it does not have or did not exercise discretionary authority to vote on another matter. 
Proposal 2, the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, is considered to be a routine item under the applicable rules and your broker will be able to vote on that item even if it does not receive instructions from you, so long as it holds your shares in its name.  If a broker or nominee holds shares of our common stock in "street name" for your account, then this proxy statement may have been forwarded to you with a voting instruction card, which allows you to instruct the broker or nominee how to vote your shares on the proposals described herein. To vote by proxy or to instruct your broker how to vote, you should follow the directions provided with the voting instruction card. In order to have your vote counted on Proposal 1, you must either provide timely voting instructions to your broker or obtain a properly executed proxy from the broker or other record holder of the shares that authorizes you to act on behalf of the record holder with respect to the shares held for your account. 
Quorum Required to Transact Business 
At the close of business on October 15, 2018, a total of 18,133,993 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Our by-laws require that a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock be represented, in person or by proxy, at the meeting in order to constitute the quorum we need to transact business at the meeting. We will count abstentions and broker non-votes as shares represented at the meeting in determining whether a quorum exists. 
Multiple Stockholders Sharing the Same Address 
If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock through a broker or other nominee, you may have elected to receive only one copy of this proxy statement and our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report. If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common stock in your own names, you may have received only one copy of this proxy statement and our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report, unless you provided our transfer agent with contrary instructions. 
This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. You may promptly obtain an additional copy of this proxy statement, enclosed proxy card and our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report by sending a written request to Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, attention William A. Sullivan, One Kendall Square, 1400W, Cambridge MA 02139, or by calling Mr. Sullivan at (617) 843-5728. If you hold your shares through a broker or other nominee and wish to discontinue householding or to change your householding election, you may do so by contacting your broker or by calling (800) 542-1061 or writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you hold shares in your own name and wish to discontinue householding or change your householding election, you may do so by calling (877) 373-6374 or writing to Computershare Investor Services at P.O. Box. 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078. PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The first proposal on the agenda for the meeting is the re-election of Scott Koenig, M.D., Ph.D. and Ivana Magovcevic-Liebisch, Ph.D., to serve as Class II directors. 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anne VanLent and William Aliski are Class I directors whose terms end at our annual meeting in 2021;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Drs. Koenig and Magovcevic-Liebisch are Class II directors whose terms end at our annual meeting in 2019;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Susan B. Washer, Ed Hurwitz and James Rosen are Class III directors whose terms end at our annual meeting in  2020.  
[END TABLE]
At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors is elected for a three-year term to succeed the directors of the same class whose terms are then expiring. The term of each Class II director elected at our 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders will begin at the meeting and end at our 2022 Annual Meeting of stockholders, or, if later, when the director's successor has been elected and has qualified. 
The following table sets forth certain information as of October 1, 2018, regarding our Class II directors, each of whom has been nominated for re-election, and each other director who will continue in office following the 2019 Annual Meeting.

If for any reason any of the nominees becomes unavailable for election, the persons designated in the proxy card may vote the shares represented by proxy for the election of a substitute nominated by the Board of Directors. Each nominee has consented to serve as a director if elected, and we currently have no reason to believe that any of them will be unable to serve. 
The two nominees receiving the greatest number of votes cast will be elected as Class II directors. Brokers may not vote shares they hold for you in the election of Directors, unless they receive timely voting instructions from you. We will not count votes withheld or broker non-votes as having been cast for the election of a director. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE RE-ELECTION OF DRS. KOENIG AND MAGOVCEVIC-LIEBISCH AS CLASS II DIRECTORS.  PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our audit committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and has further directed that management submit the selection of its independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. 
Prior to the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP, RSM US LLP had been our independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. In December 2017, our audit committee approved the dismissal of RSM US LLP and appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. RSM US LLP's audit reports on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During our two most recent fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and during the period from July 1, 2017 through December 20, 2017, we did not have any disagreement with RSM on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to RSM's satisfaction, would have caused RSM to make reference to the subject matter of disagreement in their reports on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, during such periods, there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except as set forth in this paragraph. As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as amended, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as amended, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the design and operation of our closing and financial reporting processes. Specifically, the material weaknesses were due to the fact that we did not have the appropriate resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to oversee our closing and financial reporting processes. RSM US LLP's letter to the SEC stating its agreement with the statements in this paragraph was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 21, 2017. 
During the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and the subsequent interim period through December 19, 2017, neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf consulted with Ernst & Young LLP regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to us that Ernst & Young LLP concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
Although stockholder approval of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019 is not required by law or our bylaws or other governing documents, our board of directors and audit committee believe that it is advisable and a matter of good corporate practice to give stockholders an opportunity to ratify this selection. If this proposal is not approved at the annual meeting, our board of directors will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are not expected to be present at the annual meeting. 
In order to pass, this proposal must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to this matter. We will not count abstentions or broker non-votes as votes cast. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT 
Board Composition 
Our board of directors currently consists of seven members, each of whom hold office until their successors have been elected and qualified or until the earlier of their resignation or removal. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and amended and restated bylaws also provide that our directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 percent of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors, and that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of our directors then in office. 
In accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, divided as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class I directors are Mr. Aliski and Ms. VanLent, whose terms will expire at the annual  meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal year 2021;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class II directors are Dr. Koenig and Dr. Magovcevic-Liebisch, whose terms will expire at the  2019 Annual Meeting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class III directors are Ms. Washer, Mr. Hurwitz and Mr. Rosen, whose terms will expire at  the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal year 2020.  
[END TABLE]
Upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors in that class will be eligible to be elected for a new three-year term at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which their term expires. 
Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Ms. Washer, is an "independent director" as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
One of the key functions of our board of directors is informed oversight of our risk management process. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for our company and the day to day leadership and performance of the company, while our Chairman, who is not an executive officer, sets the agenda for board meetings, facilitates communications between the board and the Chief Executive Officer and discussion among the independent directors and presides over meetings of the board and stockholders. Our independent directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, without management present, with our Chairman presiding. 
Our board of directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the board of directors as a whole, as well as through various standing committees of our board of directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, our board of directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure and our audit committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The audit committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Our nominating and corporate governance committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance practices, including whether they are successful in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct. Our compensation committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking.  Board Committees 
Our board of directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Each of these committees, which are the only standing committees of our board of directors, operates under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors. 
Audit committee. The current members of our audit committee are Mr. Hurwitz, Dr. Magovcevic-Liebisch and Ms. VanLent (chair). Our board of directors has determined that each member of the audit committee satisfies the Nasdaq Stock Market independence standards and the independence standards of Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act. Each of the members of our audit committee meets the requirements for financial literacy under applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The board of directors has also determined that Ms. VanLent qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the SEC. The audit committee assists our board of directors in its oversight of:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of our financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the performance of our independent registered public accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
The audit committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee establishes and implements policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit services and all permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm and reviews and approves any related party transactions entered into by us. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable standards of the SEC and Nasdaq. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is available in the "Investors—Corporate Governance" section of the Company's website at www.agtc.com. 
The audit committee met in person or by telephone 7 times during fiscal year 2018. 
Compensation committee. The current members of our compensation committee are Dr. Koenig, Dr. Magovcevic-Liebisch (chair) and Mr. Rosen, each of whom is an independent director. The compensation committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approves the compensation and benefits of our executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviews and makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding benefit plans and programs for employee  compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• administers our equity compensation plans.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available in the "Investors—Corporate Governance" section of our website at www.agtc.com. 
The compensation committee met in person or by telephone 5 times during fiscal year 2018. 
Nominating and corporate governance committee. The members of our nominating and corporate governance committee are Mr. Aliski (chair) and Dr. Koenig, each of whom is an independent director. Dr. Guyer and Mr. Hurwitz served on the nominating and corporate governance committee until Dr. Guyer's resignation from the Board in December 2017. In January 2018, Dr. Koenig was appointed to such committee and served with Mr. Hurwitz until Mr. Aliski joined the Board in September 2018, at which time Mr. Hurwitz left the nominating and corporate governance committee and Mr. Aliski joined the committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifies individuals qualified to become board members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommends to the board of directors nominations of persons to be elected to the board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• advises the board regarding appropriate corporate governance policies and assists the board in achieving them.   
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which is available in the "Investors—Corporate Governance" section of our website at www.agtc.com. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee met in person or by telephone 2 times during fiscal year 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of our executive officers serves, or in the past has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve as members of our board of directors or our compensation committee. None of the members of our compensation committee is an officer or employee of our company, nor has any of them ever been an officer or employee of our company. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; Corporate Governance Guidelines 
We have adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, executive officers and employees, as well as corporate governance guidelines. Copies of the code of business conduct and ethics and our corporate governance guidelines are posted on the Corporate Governance section of our website, which is located at www.agtc.com. If we make any substantive amendments to, or grant any waivers from, the code of business conduct and ethics for any officer or director, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors 
Our board of directors met in person or by telephone 6 times during fiscal year 2018. No director attended fewer than 75 percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the board of directors and of any committee of the Board on which he or she served, in each case held during the period in which he or she served as a director, in fiscal year 2018. 
Policy Regarding Board Attendance 
Our directors are expected to attend meetings of the board of directors and meetings of committees on which they serve. Our directors are expected to spend the time needed at each meeting and to meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. We encourage members of our board of directors to attend our annual meetings of stockholders, but we do not have a formal policy requiring them to do so. All of our directors then serving as directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Director Candidates and Selection Process 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee, in consultation with our board of directors, is responsible for identifying and reviewing candidates to fill open positions on the board, including positions arising as a result of the removal, resignation or retirement of any director, an increase in the size of the board or otherwise, and recommending to our full board candidates for nomination for election as directors. In recommending new directors, the committee will consider any requirements of applicable law or listing standards, a candidate's strength of character, judgment, business experience and specific area of expertise, diversity, factors relating to the composition of the board of directors (including its size and structure), and such   other factors as the committee deems to be appropriate. The goal of the committee is to assemble a board of directors that consists of individuals who bring a variety of complementary attributes and who, taken together, have the appropriate skills and experience to oversee our business. The committee is responsible for reviewing from time to time the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current make-up of the board of directors, including such factors as business experience, diversity, and personal skills in technology, finance, marketing, sales, financial reporting and other areas that contribute to an effective board of directors. In 2018, the nominating and corporate governance committee approved the director nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
The committee has not adopted any formal policy, guidelines or procedures regarding the diversity of our board of directors. Our priority in selection of board members is identification of members who will further the interests of our stockholders through an established record of professional accomplishment, the ability to contribute positively to the collaborative culture among board members, knowledge of our business and understanding of the competitive landscape. 
Stockholders may recommend individuals to the nominating and corporate governance committee for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting their names, together with appropriate biographical information and background materials and a statement as to whether the stockholder or group of stockholders making the recommendation has beneficially owned more than 5 percent of our common stock for at least a year as of the date such recommendation is made, to our nominating and corporate governance committee, c/o Secretary at our offices located at One Kendall Square, 1400W, Cambridge MA 02139. Assuming that appropriate biographical and background material has been provided on a timely basis, the nominating and corporate governance committee will evaluate stockholder-recommended candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for candidates that it recommends. If the board of directors resolves to nominate a stockholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election, then his or her name will be included in our proxy card for the next annual meeting. Any recommendation of a potential director nominee should also include a statement signed by the proposed nominee expressing a willingness to serve as a director if elected. As part of this responsibility, the committee will be responsible for conducting, subject to applicable law, any and all inquiries into the background and qualifications of any candidate for election as a director and such candidate's compliance with the independence and other qualification requirements established by the committee or imposed by applicable law or listing standards. 
Communications with our Board of Directors 
Stockholders wishing to communicate with our board of directors should send correspondence to the attention of our Secretary, Hemmie Chang, at our offices located at One Kendall Square, 1400W, Cambridge MA 02139, and should include with the correspondence evidence that the sender of the communication is one of our stockholders. Satisfactory evidence would include, for example, contemporaneous correspondence from a brokerage firm indicating the identity of the stockholder and the number of shares held. Our Secretary will review all correspondence confirmed to be from stockholders and decide whether or not to forward the correspondence or a summary of the correspondence to the full board of directors or a committee thereof. Our Secretary will review all stockholder correspondence, but the decision to relay that correspondence to the full board or a committee will rest entirely within her discretion. Our board believes that this process will suffice to handle the relatively low volume of communications we have historically received from our stockholders. If the volume of communications increases such that this process becomes burdensome to our Secretary, our board of directors may elect to adopt more elaborate screening procedures. 
Director Compensation 
Our non-employee directors receive equity-based compensation and cash fees as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each non-employee director receives an annual cash fee in the amount of  $40,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our chairman receives an additional cash fee in the amount of $35,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the chairperson of each of our board committees receives an additional annual cash fee as follows: audit  committee chair, $18,000; compensation committee chair, $12,000; and nominating and corporate governance committee chair, $8,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each other member of a board committee receives an additional annual cash fee as follows: audit committee,  $9,000; compensation committee, $6,000; and nominating and corporate governance committee, $4,000.  
[END TABLE]
The cash fees described above are paid quarterly in arrears. Non-employee directors are also reimbursed upon request for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings of the board and of committees on which they serve. 
Upon initial election to our board of directors, our non-employee directors are entitled to receive a non-qualified stock option, vesting in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, to purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, each non-employee director remaining in office receives annually a non-qualified stock option, vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant, to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock. Each such initial or annual stock option is granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
The following table sets forth information regarding compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our non-employee directors who served during fiscal year 2018. We do not pay any compensation to our President and Chief Executive Officer in connection with her service on our board of directors.

Executive Summary 
The compensation of our executive officers is determined by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, and discussed by the committee throughout the year. Our formal annual compensation review process generally takes place during the first quarter of each fiscal year, after the results of the previous fiscal year are known. Annual variable compensation and discretionary cash bonuses for the completed fiscal year, if any, and long-term equity-based incentive compensation, if any, are awarded by the committee on a discretionary basis, generally during the first fiscal quarter, after a review of the previous fiscal year's results. 
Our compensation committee is comprised entirely of non-employee directors, each of whom our Board of Directors has determined is independent within the meaning of the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The members of the compensation committee have substantial managerial experience and wide contacts in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries and in the broader healthcare industry, upon which they rely in making their determinations. The committee also takes into account publicly available information concerning the compensation practices of other companies in the biotechnology industry. This information is used by the committee informally and primarily for purposes of comparison to ascertain whether our compensation practices for our executive officers are broadly competitive. 
Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations with regard to the compensation of our executive officers other than herself, which are reviewed by the compensation committee. Executive officers do not participate in the process of establishing their own annual compensation. 
The committee does not have a formal benchmarking policy or a practice of establishing the amount of any element of our executive officers' compensation by reference to a fixed range of percentages or percentiles of the compensation of any peer or comparison group. As a result, the determinations made by the members of our compensation committee are guided to a significant degree by their collective judgment and experience. During fiscal year 2018, the committee retained a compensation consultant, Aon Consulting's Radford Surveys + Consulting, or Radford, to assist the committee in assessing the form and amount of compensation paid to our executives. 
Our compensation committee has reviewed our compensation programs and believes that our compensation programs have not encouraged or rewarded excessive or inappropriate risk taking. 
Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 
The following table sets forth information regarding compensation earned by our President and Chief Executive Officer and our two next most highly paid executive officers who served during fiscal year 2018. We refer to these individuals as our named executive officers.

Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table 
We review compensation annually for all of our employees, including our executives. In setting executive base salaries and bonuses and granting equity incentive awards, we consider compensation for comparable positions in the market, the historical compensation levels of our executives, individual performance as compared to our expectations and objectives, our desire to motivate our employees to achieve short- and long-term results that are in the best interests of our stockholders, and a long-term commitment to our company. We do not target a specific competitive position or a specific mix of compensation among base salary, bonus or long-term incentives. 
Our compensation committee reviews and discusses management's proposed compensation with the Chief Executive Officer for all executives other than our Chief Executive Officer. Based on those discussions and its discretion, the compensation committee then determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers. 
We have an at-will employment agreement with Ms. Washer, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have an at-will employment offer letter with Mr. Sullivan, our Chief Financial Officer and with Dr. Feinsod, our Interim Chief Medical Officer. For fiscal year 2018, the annual base salaries of Ms. Washer, Mr. Sullivan and Dr. Feinsod were $501,600, $340,000 and $700,000, respectively. In addition, Ms. Washer and Mr. Sullivan received bonuses for fiscal year 2018 of $200,000 and $120,000, respectively, based upon the achievement of certain corporate and individual performance goals as determined by the compensation committee. Under the terms of his offer letter, Dr. Feinsod is entitled to receive a monthly award of 2,000 shares of common stock beginning on January 11, 2018 and continuing until he ceases to serve as our Interim Chief Medical Officer. For fiscal year 2019, the annual base salaries of Ms. Washer and Mr. Sullivan were increased to $514,150 and $353,600, respectively, and Dr. Feinsod's annual base salary remained at $700,000. 
In fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee engaged Radford to assist us with the identification of an appropriate peer group of companies for purposes of benchmarking the competitiveness of our executive compensation. Our compensation committee will evaluate the need for revisions to our executive compensation program to ensure that our program is competitive with the companies with which we compete for executive talent and that it is appropriate for a public company. 
Retirement Savings 
All of our full-time employees in the United States, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan. Pursuant to our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit (which is $18,500 in calendar 2018 and was $18,000 in calendar 2017), with additional salary deferrals not to exceed $6,000 available to those employees 50 years of age or older, and to have the amount of this reduction contributed to our 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan permits us to make contributions up to the limits allowed by law on behalf of all eligible employees. Since July 1, 2017, we make matching contributions of 100% of the first 4% contributed by employees to our 401(k) plan.  Outstanding Equity Awards at Year End

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 1, 2018 are deemed outstanding, but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage ownership of any other person. To our knowledge, except as set forth in the footnotes to this table and subject to applicable community property laws, each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such person's name. Except as otherwise indicated, the address of each of the persons in this table is c/o Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, 14193 NW 119th Terrace, Suite 10, Alachua, Florida 32615. 
Each stockholder's percentage ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act and is based on 18,130,463 shares of our common stock outstanding as of October 1, 2018. The number of outstanding shares beneficially owned by each stockholder below was obtained from the most recent publicly filed information, as applicable.

Policy Regarding Hedging 
We have adopted a policy that prohibits our officers, directors or employees from entering into any short sale of our securities, buying or selling publicly traded options on our common stock or hedging their positions in our securities, including through the use of instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars or exchange funds. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These directors, executive officers and ten-percent stockholders are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms received by us, and on written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during fiscal year 2018 our directors, executive officers and ten-percent stockholders complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements, except that Dr. Feinsod filed late Form 4s with respect to the forfeiture of shares for tax purposes in connection with the granting or vesting of awards of our common stock on December 11, 2017 and February 9, 2018.   CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors that are broader in scope than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
We have adopted a written related-person transactions policy that sets forth our policies and procedures regarding the identification, review, consideration, approval and oversight of "related-person transactions." For purposes of our policy only, a "related-person transaction" is a past, present or future transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we and any "related person" are participants involving an amount that exceeds $120,000. 
Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us by an employee, consultant or director are not considered related-person transactions under this policy. A "related person," as determined since the beginning of our last fiscal year, is any executive officer, director or a holder of more than five percent of our common stock, including any of their immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. 
The policy imposes an affirmative duty upon each director and executive officer to identify any transaction involving them, their affiliates or immediate family members that may be considered a related party transaction before such person engages in the transaction. Under the policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related-person transaction, management must present information regarding the proposed related-person transaction to our audit committee (or, where review by our audit committee would be inappropriate, to another independent body of our board of directors) for review. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the direct and indirect interests of the related persons, the benefits of the transaction to us and whether any alternative transactions are available. 
Our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving in advance any related-person transactions. In determining whether to approve a related-person transaction, the audit committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the related-person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-person under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. 
Agreements with Our Stockholders 
Biogen Collaboration and License Agreement 
On July 1, 2015, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, which we refer to as the collaboration agreement, with Biogen MA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Biogen Inc. ("Biogen"), pursuant to which we and Biogen agreed to collaborate to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize gene therapy products to treat X-linked juvenile retinoschisis ("XLRS"), X-linked retinitis pigmentosa ("XLRP") and discovery programs targeting three indications based on our adeno-associated virus vector technologies. The collaboration agreement became effective in August 2015. As of the date of this proxy, Biogen MA Inc. and Biogen Inc. together own more than five percent (5%) of our voting securities. 
Under the collaboration agreement, we will be eligible to receive upfront payments, option exercise fees and milestone payments aggregating over $1 billion, including an upfront license fee of $94.0 million which we received on August 19, 2015 . During fiscal year 2017 we recorded other revenue of $1,052,000, primarily   comprised of reimbursable costs for post-funding development activities that we conducted pursuant to the terms of this collaboration agreement with Biogen. During fiscal year 2018, we earned and received a $2.5 million milestone payment from Biogen for the XLRP program and we recorded other revenue of $3,028,00 primarily comprised of reimbursable costs for post-funding development activities. In the event that Biogen exercises its option to obtain an exclusive commercial license for one or more discovery products that are designated as clinical candidates, we are eligible to receive an option exercise fee for each drug candidate. Under the collaboration agreement, we are eligible to receive development milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory, clinical development and commercialization milestones of up to $472.5 million collectively for the two lead programs and, together with option exercise fees, up to $592.5 million across the discovery programs. Biogen also has the right to substitute up to two discovery programs, with a limited ability to reinstate such substituted programs within six months. In the event Biogen elects to reinstate such substituted programs, we are eligible to receive additional option exercise fees and potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments. 
Budgeted development expenses for the programs are funded by Biogen through an allocation of the upfront license fee described below, subject to cost sharing for budget overruns and additional clinical trials that may be required prior to a pivotal trial for each of the XLRS and XLRP programs. During our development of the XLRS and XLRP products, Biogen retains the right to step in and take over the remaining development activities under specified circumstances. When Biogen assumes development responsibility, budgeted development expenses are paid by Biogen, subject to cost sharing for additional development activities. For each of the XLRS and XLRP programs, we have an option to share in development costs and resulting profits as well as an option to co-promote the second product approved in the United States. The collaboration agreement also provides for discovery programs targeting three indications whereby we will conduct discovery, research and development activities for those additional drug candidates through the stage of clinical candidate designation, after which, Biogen may exercise an option to continue to develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize the designated clinical candidate. 
Under the collaboration agreement, we granted Biogen an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use adeno-associated virus vector technology and other technology controlled by us for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing licensed products developed under the agreement. We also granted Biogen a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, of our interest in other intellectual property developed pursuant to the collaboration agreement. Biogen agreed to pay royalties for each licensed product at tiered rates ranging from high single digit to mid-teen percentages of annual net sales of the XLRS or XLRP products and rates ranging from mid-single digit to low-teen percentages of annual net sales for the discovery products.  INFORMATION ABOUT OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE AND INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Audit Committee Report 
The primary role of our audit committee is to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information proposed to be provided to stockholders and others, the adequacy of the system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures established by management and the Board, and the audit process and the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance. 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining the company's system of internal controls and for preparation of the company's financial statements. Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing an opinion on the financial statements. The audit committee has met and held discussions with management and our independent registered public accounting firm, and has also met separately with our independent registered public accounting firm, without management present, to review the adequacy of our internal controls, financial reporting practices and audit process. 
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. As part of this review, the audit committee discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the communications required by generally accepted auditing standards, including those described in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, "Communication with Audit Committees," as amended. 
The audit committee has received from our independent registered public accounting firm a written statement describing all relationships between that firm and Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation that might bear on the registered public accounting firm's independence, consistent with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence." The audit committee has discussed the written statement with the independent registered public accounting firm, and has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of any consultation and other non-audit services to Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation is compatible with maintaining the registered public accounting firm's independence. 
Based on the above-mentioned reviews and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee recommended to the Board of Directors that Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
