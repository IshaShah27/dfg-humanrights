PROXY STATEMENT
GENERAL INFORMATION
The enclosed proxy is being solicited by the Board of Directors of IKONICS Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("IKONICS" or the "Company"), for use in connection with the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 25, 2019 at The Kitchi Gammi Club, 831 E. Superior Street, Duluth, Minnesota, at 1:00 p.m., Central Time, and at any adjournments thereof. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019 will be entitled to vote at such meeting or adjournment. Proxies in the accompanying form which are properly signed, duly returned to the Company and not revoked will be voted in the manner specified. A shareholder executing a proxy retains the right to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by providing notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company of termination of the proxy's authority or a properly signed and duly returned proxy bearing a later date.
The address of the principal executive office of the Company is 4832 Grand Avenue, Duluth, Minnesota 55807 and the telephone number is (218) 628-2217. The mailing of this Proxy Statement and the form of proxy to shareholders will commence on or about March 21, 2019. This Proxy Statement is available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ikonics.com/investor-relations.php.
The Company will pay the cost of soliciting proxies in the accompanying form. In addition to solicitation by mail, certain directors, officers and employees of the Company may solicit proxies by telephone, regular or electronic mail, or personal contact, and have requested brokerage firms and custodians, nominees and other record holders to forward soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of stock of the Company and will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in so forwarding such materials.
The common stock of the Company, par value $.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), is the only authorized and issued voting security of the Company. At the close of business on March 4, 2019, there were 1,983,553 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, each of which is entitled to one vote. Holders of Common Stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.
A plurality of the votes cast is required for election of the director nominees listed under "Election of Directors" in this Proxy Statement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote is required to ratify the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and approve the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. If the advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers included in this Proxy Statement receives more votes "for" than "against," then it will be deemed to be approved. The frequency of the advisory vote on future say-on-pay votes receiving the highest number of votes (one, two or three years) by shareholders will be considered the frequency recommended by shareholders.
A shareholder voting through a proxy who abstains with respect to any matter is considered to be present and entitled to vote on such matter at the meeting and is in effect a negative vote with respect to the proposal relating to ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have no effect on the advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement or the advisory vote on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. A shareholder (including a broker) who does not have or does not give authority to vote, or withholds authority to vote, on any proposal shall not be considered present and entitled to vote on such proposal.

The following table sets forth, as of February 28, 2019, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each person who is a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Common Stock issued and outstanding, by each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table, by each director, director nominee and by all officers and directors as a group.

Committees of the Board of Directors and Meeting Attendance
The Board of Directors met six times during fiscal 2018. All incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which they served held during the periods for which they served as a director except for Mr. Jackson and Mr. Carlson, who each attended four of the six meetings in 2018. The Company currently has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee.
The following is a description of the functions performed by each of the Committees:
Audit Committee
The Company's Audit Committee presently consists of Messrs. Lee (Chairman), Carlson, Engbrecht, Harper, Jackson and Ms. Bohren. All of the members of the Audit Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Lee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling the Board's duties relating to corporate accounting, reporting practices of the Company and the quality and integrity of the Company's financial reports. Among other things, the Audit Committee selects and appoints the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm and financial management to review the scope of the audit and the audit procedures, reviews annually the responsibilities of the Audit Committee and recommends to the Board of Directors any changes to these responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on February 23, 2004. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is included as Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement. The Audit Committee met four times during fiscal 2018, once each quarter.
Compensation Committee
The Company's Compensation Committee presently consists of Messrs. Harper (Chairman), Carlson, Engbrecht, Lee, Jackson and Ms. Bohren. All of the members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and acts upon a compensation package for the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's other executive officers, and sets compensation policy for the other employees of the Company. In addition, the Compensation Committee acts upon management recommendations concerning employee stock options, bonuses and other compensation and benefit plans. The Compensation Committee also administers the IKONICS Corporation 1995 Stock Incentive Plan. The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are set forth in the Compensation Committee Charter, adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on February 28, 2013. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, the Committee has authority to delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees as the Committee may deem appropriate, provided that the subcommittees are composed entirely of independent directors. A copy of the Compensation Committee Charter is included as Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee met one time during fiscal 2018.
Nominating Committee
The Company's Nominating Committee presently consists of Ms. Bohren (Chairman) and Messrs. Carlson, Engbrecht, Harper, Lee and Jackson. All of the members of the Nominating Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The purposes of the Nominating Committee are to identify individuals qualified to become Board members and to approve director-nominees to be considered for election by shareholders and for election by the Board to fill any vacancy or newly created directorship. The responsibilities of the Nominating Committee are set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter, which is included as Exhibit A to the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Nominating Committee met three times during fiscal 2018.
The Nominating Committee has established a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by the Company's shareholders. The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by a Company shareholder provided that the shareholder sends the Company a written notice received by the Secretary of the Company that (i) states the name and address of the shareholder identifying the candidate as that information appears on the Company's books and records and the number of shares of the Company owned by the recommending shareholder and (ii) provides the following information about the candidate:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1.   name, age and business and residential addresses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2.   principal occupation or employment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   3.   number of shares of the Company beneficially owned;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   4.   statement of the person's citizenship; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   5.   any other information that must be disclosed about nominees in proxy solicitations pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including the candidate's written consent to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected).  
[END TABLE]
The Company may require any proposed candidate to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Nominating Committee to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director. Provided a shareholder satisfies the requirements described above, the Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders in the same manner that it considers all other director candidates. All director candidates must meet certain minimum qualifications established by the Nominating Committee from time to time, and the Nominating Committee will assess the experience, integrity, competence, diversity, skills and dedication to the Company of all director candidates. The Nominating Committee does not have an independent policy with regard to considering the diversity of the Company's directors. The Nominating Committee will consider a number of features when evaluating diversity, including age, gender, ethnicity and professional experiences. As indicated above, diversity is one factor in the total mix of information the Board of Directors considers when evaluating director candidates. Shareholders who wish to suggest qualified candidates should write to the Office of the Corporate Secretary of IKONICS Corporation, at 4832 Grand Avenue, Duluth, Minnesota 55807, stating the information described above and any other relevant details concerning the candidate's qualifications for consideration by the Nominating Committee.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Mr. Ulland has served in the combined roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2000. Mr. Ulland's combined service as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer creates unified leadership for the Company. This leadership structure demonstrates to customers and shareholders that the Company is under strong leadership and minimizes the potential duplication of efforts among management and the directors. The Board of Directors does not have a lead independent director and does not believe that one is necessary in light of the Company's size and the lengthy experience the majority of the directors have working with Mr. Ulland. The Board of Directors believes its leadership structure allows the Company to operate most efficiently and is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Company's management is responsible for day-to-day risk management of the Company. Management reports to the Board of Directors on the material risks the Company faces when management determines that the Company's risk profile materially changes. The Board of Directors uses management's reports to evaluate the Company's exposure to risks in light of the Company's business plan and growth strategies. The Board of Directors primarily focuses on risks in the areas of operations, liquidity and regulatory changes and compliance, which the Board of Directors believes are the areas most likely to potentially impact the Company in a material way.
Director Compensation
Each non-employee director of the Company receives a quarterly retainer of $2,000, plus meeting fees of $2,000 for each regular meeting of the Board of Directors, which totaled six in 2018. Fees are not paid for committee meetings. From time to time, the Company's non-employee directors have been awarded options to purchase the Company's Common Stock under the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan and Mr. Ulland has been awarded stock options under such plan in connection with his position as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. No such grants of stock options have been made since 2003. The following table sets forth the total compensation paid to each director for fiscal 2018. Mr. Ulland did not receive separate compensation for his service as a director during fiscal 2018.

[END TABLE]
The Board provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board or any of the directors. Shareholders may send written communications to the Board of Directors or specified individual directors by addressing their communication to Chief Financial Officer, IKONICS Corporation, 4832 Grand Avenue, Duluth, Minnesota 55807, by U.S. mail. The communications will be collected by the Chief Financial Officer and delivered, in the form received, to the Board or, if so addressed, to a specified director.
The Company does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board of Directors at the Company's Annual Meetings of Shareholders. The Company has always encouraged its directors to attend its annual meeting of shareholders and expects to continue this informal policy. In 2018, all Company current directors, other than Mr. Jackson, attended the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The role of the Company's Audit Committee, which is currently composed of six independent non-employee directors, is one of oversight of the Company's management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in regard to the Company's financial reporting and the Company's controls with respect to accounting and financial reporting. In performing its oversight function, the Audit Committee relied upon advice and information received in its discussions with the Company's management and independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has (i) reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's management; (ii) discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standard regarding communication with audit committees; (iii) received the written disclosures and the letter from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; and (iv) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
Based on the review and discussions with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Audit Committee's current practice on pre-approval of services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm is to approve annually all audit services and, on a case-by-case basis, all permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal year. The Audit Committee reviews each non-audit service to be provided and assesses the impact of the service on the auditor's independence. In addition, the Audit Committee may pre-approve other non-audit services during the year on a case-by-case basis.

[END TABLE]
The Company has not entered into employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers. The amounts portrayed in the table above under "All Other Compensation" represent the Company's contribution to its salary deferral plan adopted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's executive officers are eligible to participate in a 401(k) defined contribution plan. In any plan year, the Company will contribute to each participant up to 5% of the participant's compensation into the 401(k) plan. Each of the Named Executive Officers participated in the 401(k) plan during fiscal 2018 and 2017 and received contributions.
The Company maintains an annual bonus program pursuant to which executive officers are eligible to receive cash bonuses equal to a percentage of the year's bonus pool. Amounts shown in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column represent payments pursuant to the Company's bonus program for the applicable fiscal year. The fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 bonus pools were set at 10% of the amount by which net income before income taxes (as adjusted for unusual items of income or expense) ("EBT") for the applicable fiscal year exceeded the EBT target for that fiscal year. For fiscal year 2018 and 2017, losses in the amount of approximately $132,000 and $918,000, respectively, incurred by the Company's Advance Material Solutions Division were excluded from the bonus pool, as the Compensation/Succession Committee determined that this is a newer business in which the Company is still investing substantially. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, Mr. Ulland was eligible to receive a bonus equal to 33% of the pool. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, Mr. Piguet and Mr. Gerlach each were eligible to receive a bonus equal to 22% of the pool, respectively. The Company's other executive officer was eligible to receive a bonus equal to 22% of the pool in 2018 and 2017. No non-equity incentive plan compensation payments were made to the Named Executive Officers for 2018 or 2017 because the Company's EBT for the period did not exceed the amount required for payment under the plan.
The Company did not make any grants of stock options to the Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017.
OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS
AT FISCAL YEAR-END
There were no outstanding equity awards granted to the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2018.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS; TERMINATION OF
EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS
The Company does not have any employment agreements with any members of its executive management team, but has entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with such persons. These agreements generally provide that the executive will not solicit any other employee of the Company to leave the Company during the executive's employment with the Company and for two years following such employment, will not compete with the Company during the executive's employment and for one year thereafter, and will protect the proprietary information of the Company during and following such executive's employment.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock file initial reports of ownership of the Company's Common Stock and changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of copies of forms submitted to the Company during and with respect to fiscal 2018 and on written representations from the Company's directors and executive officers, all required reports were filed on a timely basis during fiscal 2018.
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has selected RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. It is the judgment of the Audit Committee that RSM US LLP has and will conduct its affairs in an appropriate manner and warranted selection as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. While it is not required to do so, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of RSM US LLP for ratification in order to ascertain the views of the Company's shareholders on this selection. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection.
A representative of RSM US LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to be afforded an opportunity to make a statement or respond to questions during the meeting.
APPROVAL OF THE IKONICS CORPORATION 2019 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
On February 28, 2019, our board of directors, at the recommendation of our Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), approved the IKONICS Corporation 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"), subject to approval by our shareholders at our 2019 annual meeting. The 2019 Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by our shareholders and will replace the Company's 1995 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1995 Plan"), which expired on February 18, 2019.
Awards outstanding under the 1995 Plan as of the date the 2019 Plan becomes effective continue to be subject to the terms of the 1995 Plan, but if those awards subsequently expire, are forfeited or cancelled or are settled in cash, the shares subject to those awards will become available for awards under the 2019 Plan.
As of March 1, 2019, a total of 18,000 shares were subject to outstanding awards under the 1995 Plan, of which 18,000 shares were subject to outstanding stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $13.22 per share and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 2.0 years, 0 shares were subject to unvested restricted stock awards and 0 shares were subject to unvested restricted stock units. As of the same date, 102,157 shares remained reserved for issuance under the 1995 Plan. The number of shares of our common stock that may be the subject of awards and issued under the 2019 Plan is 102,157.
Shareholder Approval and Board of Directors Recommendation 
Shareholder approval of the 2019 Plan is being sought in order to (i) satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and (ii) obtain shareholder approval of the number of shares that may be subject to incentive stock options under Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 422.
Our board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote FOR the 2019 Plan because it includes a number of features that we believe are consistent with the interests of our shareholders and sound corporate governance practices, and will provide us with a share reserve that will enable us to continue to provide a competitive mix of compensation to our key employees. Unless a contrary choice is specified, proxies solicited by the board of directors will be voted FOR approval of the 2019 Plan.
Key Compensation Practices 
The 2019 Plan includes a number of features that we believe are consistent with the interests of our shareholders and sound corporate governance practices, including the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No repricing of underwater options or stock appreciation rights without shareholder approval. The 2019 Plan prohibits, without shareholder approval, actions to reprice, replace, or repurchase options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") when the exercise price per share of an option or SAR exceeds the fair market value of the underlying shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No discounted option or SAR grants. The 2019 Plan requires that the exercise price of options or SARs be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant (except in the limited case of "substitute awards" as described below).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Conservative share recycling provisions. We may not add back to the 2019 Plan's share reserve shares that are delivered or withheld to pay the exercise price of an option award or to satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with any awards, shares that we repurchase using option exercise proceeds and shares subject to a SAR award that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of that award upon its exercise.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No liberal definition of "change in control." No change in control would be triggered by shareholder approval of a business combination transaction, the announcement or commencement of a tender offer or any board assessment that a change in control may be imminent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No automatic accelerated vesting of equity awards upon a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Limits on dividends and dividend equivalents. The 2019 Plan prohibits the payment of dividend equivalents on stock options and SARs, and requires that any dividends and dividend equivalents payable or credited on unvested full value awards must be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying shares or share equivalents.  
[END TABLE]
Description of the 2019 Plan 
The major features of the 2019 Plan are summarized below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2019 Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit C.
Eligible Participants. Employees, consultants and advisors of the Company or any subsidiary, as well as non-employee directors of the Company, will be eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. As of March 1, 2019, there were approximately 82 full-time employees, six non-employee directors of the Company and an indeterminate number of consultants and advisors who would be eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan.
Administration. The 2019 Plan will be administered by the Committee. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Committee may delegate its duties, power and authority under the 2019 Plan to any one or more of its members, or, with respect to awards to participants who are not themselves our directors or executive officers, to one or more of our other directors or executive officers or to a committee of the board comprised of one or more directors. The Committee may also delegate non-discretionary administrative duties to other persons, agents or advisors.
The Committee has the authority to determine the persons to whom awards will be granted, the timing, type and number of shares covered by each award, and the terms and conditions of the awards. The Compensation Committee may also establish and modify rules to administer the 2019 Plan, adopt sub-plans applicable to certain awards, interpret the 2019 Plan and any related award agreement, cancel or suspend an award, accelerate the vesting of an award and otherwise modify or amend the terms of outstanding awards to the extent permitted under the 2019 Plan, and require or permit the deferral of the settlement of an award. Unless an amendment to the terms of an award is necessary to comply with applicable laws or stock exchange rules, a participant who would be adversely affected by such an amendment must consent to it.
Except in connection with equity restructurings and other situations in which share adjustments are specifically authorized, the 2019 Plan prohibits the Committee from repricing any outstanding "underwater" option or SAR awards without the prior approval of our shareholders. For these purposes, a "repricing" includes amending the terms of an underwater option or SAR award to lower the exercise price, canceling an underwater option or SAR award in conjunction with granting a replacement option or SAR award with a lower exercise price, canceling an underwater option or SAR award in exchange for cash, other property or grant of a new full value award, or otherwise making an underwater option or SAR award subject to any action that would be treated under accounting rules as a "repricing."
Available Shares and Limitations on Awards. A maximum of 102,157 shares of our common stock may be the subject of awards and issued under the 2019 Plan. Shares of common stock that are issued under the 2019 Plan or that are potentially issuable pursuant to outstanding awards will reduce the 2019 Plan's share reserve by one share for each share issued or issuable pursuant to an award. The shares of common stock issuable under the 2019 Plan are authorized but unissued shares. The share limitations under the 2019 Plan are subject to adjustment for changes in our corporate structure or shares, as described below.
Any shares of common stock subject to an award under the 2019 Plan, or to an award under the 1995 Plan that is outstanding on the date our shareholders approve the 2019 Plan, that expires, is cancelled or forfeited, or is settled or paid in cash will, to the extent of such expiration, cancellation, forfeiture or cash settlement, automatically replenish the 2019 Plan share reserve and become available for future awards. In such event, the 2019 Plan's share reserve will be increased in the same amount by which the applicable share reserve was decreased upon the grant of the applicable award. Any shares tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or satisfy a tax withholding obligation in connection with any award, any shares repurchased by the Company using option exercise proceeds and any shares subject to a SAR award that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the SAR award on its exercise may not be used again for new grants.
Awards that may be settled solely in cash will not reduce the share reserve and will not reduce the shares authorized for grant to a participant in any calendar year. Awards granted or shares of our common stock issued under the 2019 Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution or exchange for, outstanding equity awards previously granted by an entity acquired by us or any of our subsidiaries (referred to as "substitute awards") will not reduce the share reserve under the 2019 Plan. Additionally, if a company acquired by us or any of our subsidiaries has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by its shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of that pre-existing plan may be used for awards under the 2019 Plan and will not reduce the share reserve under the 2019 Plan, but only if the awards are made to individuals who were not employed by or providing services to us or any of our subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition.
Share Adjustment Provisions. If certain transactions with our shareholders occur that cause the per share value of our common stock to change, such as stock splits, spin-offs, stock dividends or certain recapitalizations (referred to as "equity restructurings"), the Committee will equitably adjust (i) the class of shares issuable and the maximum number and kind of shares subject to the 2019 Plan, (ii) outstanding awards as to the class, number of shares and price per share, and (iii) award limitations prescribed by the 2019 Plan. Other types of transactions may also affect our common stock, such as reorganizations, mergers or consolidations. If there is such a transaction and the Committee determines that adjustments of the type previously described in connection with equity restructurings would be appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the 2019 Plan, the Committee will make such adjustments as it may deem equitable.
Types of Awards. The 2019 Plan permits us to award stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards, stock unit awards, and other stock-based awards to eligible recipients. These types of awards are described in more detail below.
Options. Employees of our Company or any subsidiary may be granted options to purchase common stock that qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, and any eligible recipient may be granted options to purchase common stock that do not qualify as incentive stock options, referred to as "nonqualified stock options." The per share exercise price to be paid by a participant at the time an option is exercised may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of grant, unless the option is granted as a substitute award as described earlier. "Fair market value" under the 2019 Plan as of any date means the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on that date. As of March 1, 2019, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $8.00.
The total purchase price of the shares to be purchased upon exercise of an option will be paid by the participant in cash unless the Committee allows exercise payments to be made, in whole or in part, (i) by means of a broker-assisted sale and remittance program, (ii) by delivery to us (or attestation as to ownership) of shares of common stock already owned by the participant, or (iii) by a "net exercise" of the option in which a portion of the shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the option are withheld by us. Any shares delivered or withheld in payment of an exercise price will be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.
An option will vest and become exercisable at such time, in such installments and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Committee, and no option may have a term greater than 10 years from its date of grant. No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited with respect to shares subject to an option award.
The aggregate fair market value of shares of our common stock with respect to which incentive stock options granted to any participant may first become exercisable during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Any incentive stock options that become exercisable in excess of this amount will be treated as nonqualified stock options. The maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock option awards under the 2019 Plan is equal to the size of the 2019 Plan's share reserve as described above.
Stock Appreciation Rights. A SAR award provides the right to receive a payment from us equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value as of the date of exercise of the number of shares of our common stock as to which the SAR is being exercised, and (ii) the aggregate exercise price of that number of shares. The Committee determines whether payment will be made in shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of both. The exercise price per share of a SAR award will be determined by the Committee, but may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of grant, unless the SAR is granted as a substitute award as described earlier. No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid or credited with respect to shares subject to a SAR award. A SAR award may not have a term greater than 10 years from its date of grant, and will be subject to such other terms and conditions, consistent with the terms of the 2019 Plan, as may be determined by the Committee.
Restricted Stock Awards. A restricted stock award is an award of our common stock that vests at such times and in such installments as may be determined by the Committee. Until it vests, the shares subject to the award are subject to restrictions on transferability and the possibility of forfeiture. The Committee may impose such restrictions or conditions to the vesting of restricted stock awards as it deems appropriate, including that the participant remain continuously in our service for a certain period or that we, or any of our subsidiaries or business units, satisfy specified performance goals. Any dividends or distributions payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unvested portion of a restricted stock award will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the shares to which such dividends or distributions relate. Participants are entitled to vote restricted shares prior to the time they vest.
Stock Unit Awards. A stock unit award is a right to receive the fair market value of a specified number of shares of our common stock, payable in cash, shares, or a combination of both, that vests at such times, in such installments and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Committee. Until it vests, a stock unit award is subject to restrictions and the possibility of forfeiture. Stock unit awards will be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the 2019 Plan, as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may provide for the payment of dividend equivalents on stock unit awards and other stock-based awards, but any such dividend equivalents will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the underlying units or other share equivalents to which such dividend equivalents relate.
Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may grant awards of common stock and other awards that are valued by reference to and/or payable in shares of our common stock under the 2019 Plan. The Committee has discretion in determining the terms and conditions of such awards.
Transferability of Awards. In general, no right or interest in any award under the 2019 Plan may be assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered by a participant, voluntarily or involuntarily, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, the Committee may provide that an award (other than an incentive stock option) may be transferable by gift to a participant's family member or pursuant to a domestic relations order. Any permitted transferee of such an award will remain subject to all the terms and conditions of the award applicable to the participant.
Change in Control. If a change in control of the Company that involves a corporate transaction occurs, then the consequences will be as described below unless the Committee provides otherwise in an applicable award or other agreement with the participant. If outstanding awards are continued, assumed or replaced by the surviving or successor entity in connection with a corporate transaction, and if within 12 months after the corporate transaction a participant's employment or other service is involuntarily terminated without cause, (i) each of the participant's outstanding options and SARs will become exercisable in full and remain exercisable for 30 days, and (ii) each of the participant's unvested full value awards will fully vest. For these purposes, a performance-based full value award will be considered fully vested if the performance goals are deemed to have been satisfied at the target level of performance and the vested portion of the award at that level of performance is proportionate to the portion of the performance period elapsed prior to the participant's termination of employment or other service.
If any outstanding award is not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a change in control involving a corporate transaction, then (i) all outstanding options and SARs will become fully exercisable for a period of time prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction and will then terminate at the effective time of the corporate transaction, and (ii) all full value awards will fully vest immediately prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction. In this scenario, performance-based full value awards will be considered fully vested in the same manner as described above, except that the proportionate vesting amount will be determined with respect to the portion of the performance period that elapsed prior to the corporate transaction. Alternatively, if outstanding awards are not continued, assumed or replaced, the Committee may elect to cancel such awards in exchange for a payment with respect to each award in an amount equal to the excess, if any, between the fair market value of the shares subject to the award immediately prior to the effective date of such corporate transaction (which may be the fair market value of the consideration to be received in the corporate transaction for the same number of shares) over the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the shares subject to such award (or, if there is no excess, such award may be terminated without payment).
If a change in control of the Company that does not involve a corporate transaction occurs, the Committee may, in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding awards, which may include providing for the cancellation of any award in exchange for payments in a manner similar to that provided above in connection with a corporate transaction, or making such adjustments to the awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such change in control, which may include the acceleration of vesting in full or in part. The Committee will not be required to treat all awards similarly in such circumstances.
For purposes of the 2019 Plan, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

● A "change in control" generally refers to a corporate transaction as defined below, the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting power of our stock, or our incumbent directors ceasing to constitute a majority of our board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A "corporate transaction" generally means (i) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (ii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company.  
[END TABLE]
Effect of Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise set forth in an applicable agreement, if a participant ceases to be employed by or provide other services to us and our subsidiaries, awards under the 2019 Plan will be treated as set forth in the 2019 Plan. Upon termination for cause, all unexercised option and SAR awards and all unvested portions of any other outstanding awards will be immediately forfeited without consideration. Upon termination for any other reason, all unvested and unexercisable portions of any outstanding awards will be immediately forfeited without consideration. Upon termination for any reason other than cause, death, disability or retirement, the currently vested and exercisable portions of option and SAR awards may be exercised for a period of three months after the date of termination; however, if the participant dies during such three-month period, the vested and exercisable portions of the option and SAR awards may be exercised for a period of one year after the date of such termination. Upon termination due to death, disability or Retirement, the currently vested and exercisable portions of option and SAR awards may be exercised for a period of one year after the date of termination. Under the 2019 Plan, "cause" is generally defined as (i) material failure to perform satisfactorily the duties reasonably required by the Company; (ii) material violation of any law, rule, regulation, court order or regulatory directive (other than traffic violations, misdemeanors or other minor offenses); (iii) material breach of the Company's business conduct or ethics code or of any fiduciary duty or nondisclosure, non-solicitation, non-competition or similar obligation owed to the Company or any affiliate; (iv) engaging in any act or practice that involves personal dishonesty on the part of the employee or demonstrates a willful and continuing disregard for the best interests of the Company and its affiliates; or (v) engaging in dishonorable or disruptive behavior, practices or acts which would be reasonably expected to harm or bring disrepute to the Company or any of its affiliates, their business or any of their customers, employees or vendors. In addition, "retirement" is defined as any termination of a participant's service, other than for cause, occurring at or after age 65, or at or after age 55 with ten years or more of continuous service to the Company.
Effective Date and Term of the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by the Company's shareholders. No awards will be made under the 2019 Plan prior to its effective date. Unless terminated earlier, the 2019 Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the effective date. Awards outstanding under the 2019 Plan at the time it is terminated will continue in accordance with their terms and the terms of the 2019 Plan unless otherwise provided in the applicable agreements. Our board of directors may suspend or terminate the 2019 Plan at any time.
Amendment of the Plan. Our board of directors may amend the 2019 Plan from time to time, but no amendments to the 2019 Plan will be effective without shareholder approval if such approval is required under applicable laws, regulations or stock exchange rules. Termination, suspension or amendment of the 2019 Plan may not adversely affect any outstanding award without the consent of the affected participant, except for amendments necessary to comply with applicable laws or stock exchange rules.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences to the Company and to participants subject to U.S. taxation with respect to awards granted under the 2019 Plan, based on current statutes, regulations and interpretations.
Non-qualified Stock Options. If a participant is granted a non-qualified stock option under the 2019 Plan, the participant will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of the option. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired at the time of exercise and the exercise price paid. The participant's basis in the common stock for purposes of determining gain or loss on a subsequent sale or disposition of such shares generally will be the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option was exercised. Any subsequent gain or loss will be taxable as a capital gain or loss. The Company will generally be entitled to a federal income tax deduction at the time and for the same amount as the participant recognizes as ordinary income.
Incentive Stock Options. If a participant is granted an incentive stock option under the 2019 Plan, the participant will not recognize taxable income upon grant of the option. Additionally, if applicable holding period requirements (a minimum of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise) are met, the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise. However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired at the time of exercise over the aggregate exercise price is an item of tax preference income potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax. If shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option are held for the holding period described above, the gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition of the shares will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will not be entitled to any deduction. Except in the event of death, if the holding period requirements are not met, the incentive stock option will be treated as one that does not meet the requirements of the Code for incentive stock options and the tax consequences described for nonqualified stock options will generally apply.
Other Awards. The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the 2019 Plan generally follow certain basic patterns. An award of restricted stock results in income recognition by a participant in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received at the time the restrictions lapse and the shares vest, unless the participant elects under Code Section 83(b) to accelerate income recognition and the taxability of the award to the date of grant. Stock unit awards generally result in income recognition by a participant at the time payment of such an award is made in an amount equal to the amount paid in cash or the then-current fair market value of the shares received, as applicable. SAR awards result in income recognition by a participant at the time such an award is exercised in an amount equal to the amount paid in cash or the then-current fair market value of the shares received by the participant, as applicable. In each of the foregoing cases, the Company will generally have a corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to Code Section 162(m) with respect to covered employees.
Section 162(m) of the Code. Code Section 162(m) denies a deduction to any publicly-held corporation for compensation paid to certain "covered employees" in a taxable year to the extent that compensation to the covered employee exceeds $1,000,000.
Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing discussion of tax consequences of awards under the 2019 Plan assumes that the award discussed is either not considered a "deferred compensation arrangement" subject to Section 409A of the Code, or has been structured to comply with its requirements. If an award is considered a deferred compensation arrangement subject to Section 409A but fails to comply, in operation or form, with the requirements of Section 409A, the affected participant would generally be required to include in income when the award vests the amount deemed "deferred," would be required to pay an additional 20% income tax on such amount, and would be required to pay interest on the tax that would have been paid but for the deferral.
Awards Under the 2019 Plan 
Because the 2019 Plan will not become effective until it is approved by our shareholders, the Committee has not yet approved any awards under, or subject to, the 2019 Plan. In addition, because all awards under the 2019 Plan are discretionary with the Committee, neither the number nor types of future 2019 Plan awards to be received by or allocated to particular participants or groups of participants is presently determinable.
Required Vote; Effect of Proposal
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock of the entitled to vote on this item and present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of this proposal. Proxies solicited by our board of directors will be voted for approval of this proposal, unless otherwise specified.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL.
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF  FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Company is seeking an advisory vote from shareholders as to the frequency with which shareholders would have an opportunity to provide future advisory votes on compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers. The shareholders may select a frequency of every one, two or three years, or abstain from voting on this matter. The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders approve a frequency of one year (i.e., an annual vote) to allow shareholders an opportunity to provide regular, frequent feedback on the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. The frequency recommended by shareholders will not be binding on the Company or the Board of Directors.
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Company is asking its shareholders to provide advisory approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers included in this Proxy Statement, as the Company has described it in the "Executive Compensation" section. This vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company believes its executive compensation practices, including the lack of employment agreements, change-in-control agreements or perquisites, demonstrate good governance practices and align the interests of the Company's executive officers and shareholders. The Company also believes that the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement is significantly lower than the compensation paid to similar executive officers at companies similar to IKONICS due to the Company's relative low-cost location in Duluth, Minnesota, its historical pay practices, and its focus on pay equity among the Named Executive Officers.
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders approve the following advisory resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the individuals identified in the Summary Compensation Table, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, is hereby approved.
ADDITIONAL MATTERS
The Annual Report of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements, is being mailed with this Proxy Statement.
Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received by the Company at its principal executive office no later than November 23, 2019 for inclusion in the Proxy Statement for that meeting. Such proposals must also meet all the relevant requirements of the Company's By-laws in order to be included in the Proxy Statement.
If a shareholder desires to propose an item of business for consideration without inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement, then the shareholder must comply with all of the applicable requirements set forth in the By-laws, including timely written notice of such proposal delivered to the Secretary at the Company's principal executive office. To be timely under our By-laws for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we must receive such notice not later than the close of business on January 26, 2020.
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, management knows of no matters that will be presented for determination at the meeting other than those referred to herein. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting calling for a vote of shareholders, it is intended that the shares of Common Stock represented by the proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted by the persons named therein in accordance with their best judgment.

IKONICS CORPORATION     AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER  (as of February 23, 2004) 
Purpose
        There shall be an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") IKONICS Corporation (the "Company").
        The Audit Committee's purpose is to oversee accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits of the financial statements of the Company. The Committee also has oversight of the independent auditor's qualifications and independence and the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditor.
Organization
        The Audit Committee shall consist of at least three directors. The members of the Audit Committee and the Chair of the Audit Committee shall be appointed by the Board. Each director appointed to the Audit Committee shall:
        1.     satisfy the requirements of the The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") rules relating to Audit Committee members, including (a) the applicable independence requirements in effect from time to time, (b) the requirement that Audit Committee members not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past three years and (c) the requirement that the Audit Committee members be able to read and understand financial statements, including the Company's balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement; and
        2.     satisfy, as applicable, the independence requirements of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
        At least one member of the Audit Committee must have accounting or financial management expertise as required by the Nasdaq rules. In addition, the Audit Committee shall endeavor to have at all times on the Audit Committee at least one member who satisfies the definition of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC.
        Compliance with the foregoing requirements shall be determined by the Board in its business judgment and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and standards in effect from time to time.
Responsibilities
        The Audit Committee recognizes that the preparation of the Company's financial statements and other financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management and that auditing, or conducting reviews of, those financial statements and other financial information is the responsibility of the Company's independent auditor. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to oversee the management and the outside auditors in regard to the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits of the financial statements of the Company.
        The Company's management, and its independent auditor, in the exercise of their responsibilities, acquire greater knowledge and more detailed information about the Company and its financial affairs than members of the Audit Committee. Consequently, the Audit Committee is not responsible for providing any expert or special assurance as to the Company's financial statements and other financial information or any professional certification as to the independent auditor's work, including without limitation its reports on and reviews of the Company's financial statements and other financial information.
Oversight of Independent Auditor
        1.     The Audit Committee shall be directly responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation, evaluation, termination and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The Audit Committee shall have sole authority to approve all audit engagement fees and terms and any non-audit engagements of the independent auditor, subject to the Audit Committee's right to delegate such authority as provided below and to the provisions of any policy regarding pre-approval of services established by the Audit Committee as provided below. The independent auditor shall report directly to the Audit Committee. The Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, for payment of compensation to any accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Company.
        2.     The Audit Committee shall pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by its independent auditor, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rule 2-01(c)(7) of Regulation S-X. The Audit Committee may delegate authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee, who are independent directors, the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such member(s) shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee may establish policies and procedures regarding the engagement of the independent auditor to render services to the Company, provided that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the Audit Committee is informed of each service and the pre-approval policies and procedures do not include the delegation of the Audit Committee responsibilities to management. If pre-approval policies and procedures are adopted, the Company may engage the independent auditor to perform services consistent with the policies and procedures. When pre-approving non-audit services, the Audit Committee should consider whether the provision of the non-audit services by the independent auditor is compatible with maintaining the independent auditor's independence.
Authority to Engage Independent Advisors
        The Audit Committee shall have the authority to retain independent counsel and other legal, accounting or other advisors as it determines necessary to carry out its duties. The Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, for payment of compensation to any advisors employed by the Audit Committee.
Other Responsibilities
        The Audit Committee, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate or to the extent required by the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC or the rules of the Nasdaq, shall:
        1.     Responsibility for Financial Statement and Disclosure Matters
        (a)   Review and discuss with management and the independent auditor the Company's annual audited financial statements, including disclosures made in management's discussion and analysis, and recommend to the Board whether the audited financial statements should be included in the Company's Form 10-K.
        (b)   Review the Company's quarterly financial statements, including disclosures made in management's discussion and analysis, prior to the filing of its Form 10-Q, including the results of the independent auditor's review of the quarterly financial statements. The review and discussion should include any matters identified by the independent auditor pursuant to Statement on Auditing Standards No. 71 regarding the Company's interim financial statements.
        (c)   Discuss with management and the independent auditor significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of the Company's financial statements, including any significant changes in the Company's selection or application of accounting principles, any major issues as to the adequacy of the Company's internal controls and any special steps adopted in light of material control deficiencies.
        (d)   Review and discuss any quarterly reports from the independent auditor on:
        (i)    all critical accounting policies and practices to be used,
        (ii)   all alternative treatments of financial information within generally accepted accounting principles that have been discussed with management, ramifications of the use of such alternative disclosures and treatments, and the treatment preferred by the independent auditor, and
        (iii)  other material written communications between the independent auditor and management, such as any management letter or schedule of unadjusted differences.
        (e)   Discuss with management and the independent auditor the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives as well as off-balance sheet structures on the Company's financial statements.

        (g)   Receive information from the Company's management about any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls.
        2.     Oversight of the Company's Relationship with the Independent Auditor
        (a)   Review and evaluate the lead partner of the independent audit team.
        (b)   Obtain and review a report from the independent auditor at least annually regarding:
        (i)    the independent auditor's internal quality-control procedures,
        (ii)   any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm,
        (iii)  any steps taken to deal with any such issues, and
        (iv)  all relationships between the independent auditor and the Company consistent with Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1.
Actively engage in a dialogue with the independent auditor regarding any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent auditor. Evaluate the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditor, including considering whether the auditor's quality controls are adequate and the provision of permitted non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence, taking into account the opinions of management and internal auditors.

        (c)   Ensure the rotation of the audit partner, lead partner and concurring partner of the independent auditor as required by law.

        (g)   Meet with the independent auditor prior to the audit to discuss the planning and staffing of the audit.
        3.     Oversight of the Company's Internal Audit Function
        (a)   Review the appointment and replacement of the senior internal auditing executive, if any.
        (b)   Review the significant reports to management prepared by the internal auditing function, if any, and management's responses.
        (c)    Discuss with the independent auditor and management the responsibilities, budget and staffing of the internal audit function, if any, and any recommended changes in the planned scope of the internal audit.
        4.     Compliance Oversight
        (a)   Obtain from the independent auditor assurance that the audit was conducted in a manner consistent with Section 10A(b) of the Exchange Act.
        (b)   Administer and oversee, to the extent directed by the Board, any codes of ethics or business conduct adopted by the Company.

The Audit Committee shall report regularly to the Board through presentations at Board meetings or by submission of the minutes of the Audit Committee meetings to the Board.

IKONICS Corporation
2019 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
1.       Purpose. The purpose of the IKONICS Corporation 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of responsibility with the Company, to provide additional incentives to them and align their interests with those of the Company's shareholders, and to thereby promote the Company's long-term business success.
2.       Definitions. In this Plan, the following definitions will apply.
(a)       "Affiliate" means any entity that is a Subsidiary of the Company.
(b)       "Agreement" means the written or electronic agreement, notice or other document containing the terms and conditions applicable to each Award granted under the Plan, including all amendments thereto. An Agreement is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
(c)       "Award" means a grant made under the Plan in the form of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Stock Units or an Other Stock-Based Award.

(f)       "Change in Control" means, unless otherwise defined in a then-effective written agreement (including an Agreement) between a Participant and the Company or any Affiliate, one of the following:
(1)      An Exchange Act Person becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, except that the following will not constitute a Change in Control:
(A)       any acquisition of securities of the Company by an Exchange Act Person from the Company for the purpose of providing financing to the Company;
(B)       any formation of a Group consisting solely of beneficial owners of the Company's Voting Securities as of the effective date of this Plan;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Award constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Code Section 409A, and if that Award provides for a change in the time or form of payment upon a Change in Control, then no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred upon an event described in this Section 2(f) unless the event would also constitute a change in ownership or effective control of, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of, the Company under Code Section 409A.
(g)      "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and in effect from time to time. For purposes of the Plan, references to sections of the Code shall be deemed to include any applicable regulations thereunder and any successor or similar statutory provisions.

(b)      Scope of Authority. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to take such actions as it deems necessary or advisable to administer the Plan, including:
(1)      determining the Service Providers to whom Awards will be granted, the timing of each such Award, the type of and the number of Shares covered by each Award, the terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions and other provisions of Awards, and the manner in which Awards are paid or settled;
(2)      cancelling or suspending an Award, accelerating the vesting or extending the exercise period of an Award, or otherwise amending the terms and conditions of any outstanding Award, subject to the requirements of Sections 15(d) and 15(e);
(3)      adopting sub-plans or special provisions applicable to Awards, establishing, amending or rescinding rules to administer the Plan, interpreting the Plan and any Award or Agreement, reconciling any inconsistency, correcting any defect or supplying an omission in the Plan or any Agreement, and making all other determinations necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan;
(4)       granting Substitute Awards under the Plan;
(5)       taking such actions as are provided in Section 3(c) with respect to Awards to foreign Service Providers; and
(6)       requiring or permitting the deferral of the settlement of an Award, and establishing the terms and conditions of any such deferral.
(c)      Awards to Foreign Service Providers. The Committee may grant Awards to Service Providers who are foreign nationals, who are located outside of the United States or who are not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, or who are otherwise subject to (or could cause the Company to be subject to) legal or regulatory requirements of countries outside of the United States, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to comply with applicable foreign laws and regulatory requirements and to promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan. In connection therewith, the Committee may establish such subplans and modify exercise procedures and other Plan rules and procedures to the extent such actions are deemed necessary or desirable, and may take any other action that it deems advisable to obtain local regulatory approvals or to comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions.
(d)      Acts of the Committee; Delegation. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for any meeting of the Committee, and any act of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present or any act unanimously approved in writing by all members of the Committee shall be the act of the Committee. Any such action of the Committee shall be valid and effective even if one or more members of the Committee at the time of such action are later determined not to have satisfied all of the criteria for membership in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 2(h). To the extent not inconsistent with applicable law or stock exchange rules, the Committee may delegate all or any portion of its authority under the Plan to any one or more of its members or, as to Awards to Participants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to one or more directors or executive officers of the Company or to a committee of the Board comprised of one or more directors of the Company. The Committee may also delegate non-discretionary administrative responsibilities in connection with the Plan to such other persons as it deems advisable.
(e)      Finality of Decisions. The Committee's interpretation of the Plan and of any Award or Agreement made under the Plan and all related decisions or resolutions of the Board or Committee shall be final and binding on all parties with an interest therein.
(f)      Indemnification. Each person who is or has been a member of the Committee or of the Board, and any other person to whom the Committee delegates authority under the Plan, shall be indemnified by the Company, to the maximum extent permitted by law, against liabilities and expenses imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such person in connection with or resulting from any claims against such person by reason of the performance of the individual's duties under the Plan. This right to indemnification is conditioned upon such person providing the Company an opportunity, at the Company's expense, to handle and defend the claims before such person undertakes to handle and defend them on such person's own behalf. The Company will not be required to indemnify any person for any amount paid in settlement of a claim unless the Company has first consented in writing to the settlement. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such person or persons may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise.
4.        Shares Available Under the Plan.
(a)      Maximum Shares Available. Subject to Section 4(b) and to adjustment as provided in Section 12(a), the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards and issued under the Plan shall be 102,157. No further awards may be made under the Prior Plan after the effective date of this Plan. Shares issued under the Plan may come from authorized and unissued shares. In determining the number of Shares to be counted against this share reserve in connection with any Award, the following rules shall apply:
(1)      Where the number of Shares subject to an Award is variable on the Grant Date, the number of Shares to be counted against the share reserve shall be the maximum number of Shares that could be received under that particular Award, until such time as it can be determined that only a lesser number of shares could be received.
(2)      Where two or more types of Awards are granted to a Participant in tandem with each other, such that the exercise of one type of Award with respect to a number of Shares cancels at least an equal number of Shares of the other, the number of Shares to be counted against the share reserve shall be the largest number of Shares that would be counted against the share reserve under either of the Awards.
(3)      Shares subject to Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the Shares authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year.
(4)      Awards that may be settled solely in cash shall not be counted against the share reserve, nor shall they reduce the Shares authorized for grant to a Participant in any calendar year.
(b)      Effect of Forfeitures and Other Actions. Any Shares subject to an Award, or to an award granted under the Prior Plan that is outstanding on the effective date of this Plan (a "Prior Plan Award"), that expires, is cancelled or forfeited or is settled for cash shall, to the extent of such cancellation, forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement, again become available for Awards under this Plan, and the share reserve under Section 4(a) shall be correspondingly replenished. The following Shares shall not, however, again become available for Awards or replenish the share reserve under Section 4(a): (i) Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by the Participant or withheld by the Company in payment of the exercise price of a stock option issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan, (ii) Shares tendered (either actually or by attestation) by the Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an award under this Plan or the Prior Plan, (iii) Shares repurchased by the Company with proceeds received from the exercise of a stock option issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan, and (iv) Shares subject to a stock appreciation right award issued under this Plan or the Prior Plan that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of that award upon its exercise.
(c)       Effect of Plans Operated by Acquired Companies. If a company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall supplement the Share reserve under Section 4(a). Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not Employees or Non-Employee Directors prior to such acquisition or combination.
(d)       No Fractional Shares. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the number of Shares subject to an Award shall always be a whole number. No fractional Shares may be issued under the Plan, but the Committee may, in its discretion, adopt any rounding convention it deems suitable or pay cash in lieu of any fractional Share in settlement of an Award.
5.       Eligibility. Participation in the Plan is limited to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees.
6.       General Terms of Awards.
(a)       Award Agreement. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Agreement setting forth the amount of the Award together with such other terms and conditions applicable to the Award (and not inconsistent with the Plan) as determined by the Committee. An Award to a Participant may be made singly or in combination with any form of Award. Two types of Awards may be made in tandem with each other such that the exercise of one type of Award with respect to a number of Shares reduces the number of Shares subject to the related Award by at least an equal amount.
(b)       Vesting and Term. Each Agreement shall set forth the period until the applicable Award is scheduled to vest and, if applicable, expire (which shall not be more than ten years from the Grant Date), and the applicable vesting conditions and any applicable performance period. The Committee may provide in an Agreement for such vesting conditions and timing as it may determine.
(c)       Transferability. Except as provided in this Section 6(c), (i) during the lifetime of a Participant, only the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative may exercise an Option or SAR, or receive payment with respect to any other Award; and (ii) no Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, exchanged or encumbered, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted transfer in violation of this Section 6(c) shall be of no effect. The Committee may, however, provide in an Agreement or otherwise that an Award (other than an Incentive Stock Option) may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order or may be transferable by gift to any "family member" (as defined in General Instruction A.1(a)(5) to Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933) of the Participant. Any Award held by a transferee shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to that Award immediately before the transfer thereof. For purposes of any provision of the Plan relating to notice to a Participant or to acceleration or termination of an Award upon the death or termination of Service of a Participant, the references to "Participant" shall mean the original grantee of an Award and not any transferee.
(d)       Designation of Beneficiary. To the extent permitted by the Committee, a Participant may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive a payment under any Award that is exercisable or payable on or after the Participant's death. Any such designation shall be on a form approved by the Company and shall be effective upon its receipt by the Company.
(e)       Termination of Service. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement or another then-effective written agreement between a Participant and the Company, and subject to Section 12 of this Plan, if a Participant's Service with the Company and all of its Affiliates terminates, the following provisions shall apply (in all cases subject to the scheduled expiration of an Option or SAR Award, as applicable):
(1)      Upon termination of Service for Cause, or upon conduct during a post-termination exercise period that would constitute Cause, all unexercised Option and SAR Awards and all unvested portions of any other outstanding Awards shall be immediately forfeited without consideration.
(2)      Upon termination of Service for any other reason, all unvested and unexercisable portions of any outstanding Awards shall be immediately forfeited without consideration.
(3)      Upon termination of Service for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability or Retirement, the currently vested and exercisable portions of Option and SAR Awards may be exercised for a period of three months after the date of such termination. However, if a Participant thereafter dies during such three-month period, the vested and exercisable portions of the Option and SAR Awards may be exercised for a period of one year after the date of such termination.
(4)      Upon termination of Service due to death, Disability or Retirement, the currently vested and exercisable portions of Option and SAR Awards may be exercised for a period of one year after the date of such termination.
(f)       Rights as Shareholder. No Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by an Award unless and until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of the Shares, if any, to which the Award relates.
(g)      Performance-Based Awards. Any Award may be granted as a performance-based Award if the Committee establishes one or more measures of corporate, business unit or individual performance which must be attained, and the performance period over which the specified performance is to be attained, as a condition to the grant, vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or settlement in cash or Shares of such Award. In connection with any such Award, the Committee shall determine the extent to which performance measures have been attained and other applicable terms and conditions have been satisfied, and the degree to which the grant, vesting, exercisability, lapse of restrictions and/or settlement of such Award has been earned. The Committee shall also have the authority to provide, in an Agreement or otherwise, for the modification of a performance period and/or adjustments to or waivers of the achievement of performance goals under specified circumstances such as (i) the occurrence of events that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring, such as a Change in Control, an equity restructuring (as described in Section 12(a)), acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring activities, recapitalizations, or asset write-downs, (ii) a change in applicable tax laws or accounting principles, or (iii) the Participant's death or Disability.
(h)      Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. No dividends, dividend equivalents or distributions will be paid with respect to Shares subject to an Option or SAR Award. Any dividends or distributions payable with respect to Shares that are subject to the unvested portion of a Restricted Stock Award will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the Shares to which such dividends or distributions relate. In its discretion, the Committee may provide in an Award Agreement for a Stock Unit Award or an Other Stock-Based Award that the Participant will be entitled to receive dividend equivalents, based on dividends actually declared and paid on outstanding Shares, on the units or other Share equivalents subject to the Stock Unit Award or Other Stock-Based Award, and such dividend equivalents will be subject to the same restrictions and risk of forfeiture as the units or other Share equivalents to which such dividend equivalents relate. The additional terms of any such dividend equivalents will be as set forth in the applicable Agreement, including the time and form of payment and whether such dividend equivalents will be credited with interest or deemed to be reinvested in additional units or Share equivalents. Any Shares issued or issuable during the term of this Plan as the result of the reinvestment of dividends or the deemed reinvestment of dividend equivalents in connection with an Award or a Prior Plan Award shall be counted against, and replenish upon any subsequent forfeiture, the Plan's share reserve as provided in Section 4.
7.       Stock Option Awards.
(a)      Type and Exercise Price. The Agreement pursuant to which an Option Award is granted shall specify whether the Option is an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Qualified Stock Option. The exercise price at which each Share subject to an Option Award may be purchased shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement, and shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards (to the extent consistent with Code Section 409A and, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, Code Section 424).
(b)      Payment of Exercise Price. The purchase price of the Shares with respect to which an Option Award is exercised shall be payable in full at the time of exercise. The purchase price may be paid in cash or in such other manner as the Committee may permit, including by payment under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program, by withholding Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant upon exercise of the Option or by delivery to the Company of Shares (by actual delivery or attestation) already owned by the Participant (in either case, such Shares having a Fair Market Value as of the date the Option is exercised equal to the purchase price of the Shares being purchased).
(c)      Exercisability and Expiration. Each Option Award shall be exercisable in whole or in part on the terms provided in the Agreement. No Option Award shall be exercisable at any time after its scheduled expiration. When an Option Award is no longer exercisable, it shall be deemed to have terminated.
(d)      Incentive Stock Options.
(1)     An Option Award will constitute an Incentive Stock Option Award only if the Participant receiving the Option Award is an Employee, and only to the extent that (i) it is so designated in the applicable Agreement and (ii) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Option Award's Grant Date) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Option Awards held by the Participant first become exercisable in any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Company and its Affiliates) does not exceed $100,000 or such other amount specified by the Code. To the extent an Option Award granted to a Participant exceeds this limit, the Option Award shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option Award. The maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Option Awards under the Plan shall be the number specified in the first sentence of Section 4(a), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12(a).
(2)     No Participant may receive an Incentive Stock Option Award under the Plan if, immediately after the grant of such Award, the Participant would own (after application of the rules contained in Code Section 424(d)) Shares possessing more than 10% of the total combined Voting Power of all classes of stock of the Company or an Affiliate, unless (i) the per Share exercise price for such Award is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date and (ii) such Award will expire no later than five years after its Grant Date.
(3)      For purposes of continued Service by a Participant who has been granted an Incentive Stock Option Award, no approved leave of absence may exceed three months unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is provided by statute or contract. If reemployment is not so provided, then on the date six months following the first day of such leave, any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant shall cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
(4)      If an Incentive Stock Option Award is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Code Section 422, such Option shall thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
(5)      The Agreement covering an Incentive Stock Option Award shall contain such other terms and provisions that the Committee determines necessary to qualify the Option Award as an Incentive Stock Option Award.
8.       Stock Appreciation Right Awards. 
(a)     Nature of Award. An Award of Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as are determined by the Committee, and shall provide a Participant the right to receive upon exercise of the SAR Award all or a portion of the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise of the SAR Award of the number of Shares as to which the SAR Award is being exercised, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such number of Shares. The per Share exercise price for any SAR Award shall be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Agreement, and shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date, except in the case of Substitute Awards (to the extent consistent with Code Section 409A).
(b)     Exercise of SAR. Each SAR Award may be exercisable in whole or in part at the times, on the terms and in the manner provided in the Agreement. No SAR Award shall be exercisable at any time after its scheduled expiration. When a SAR Award is no longer exercisable, it shall be deemed to have terminated. Upon exercise of a SAR Award, payment to the Participant shall be made at such time or times as shall be provided in the Agreement in the form of cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares as determined by the Committee. The Agreement may provide for a limitation upon the amount or percentage of the total appreciation on which payment (whether in cash and/or Shares) may be made in the event of the exercise of a SAR Award.
9.       Restricted Stock Awards.
(a)      Vesting and Consideration. Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be subject to vesting and the lapse of applicable restrictions based on such conditions or factors and occurring over such period of time as the Committee may determine in its discretion. The Committee may provide whether any consideration other than Services must be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, and may correspondingly provide for Company reacquisition or repurchase rights if such additional consideration has been required and some or all of a Restricted Stock Award does not vest.
(b)      Shares Subject to Restricted Stock Awards. Unvested Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be evidenced by a book-entry in the name of the Participant with the Company's transfer agent or by one or more Stock certificates issued in the name of the Participant. Any such Stock certificate shall be deposited with the Company or its designee, together with an assignment separate from the certificate, in blank, signed by the Participant, and bear an appropriate legend referring to the restricted nature of the Restricted Stock evidenced thereby. Any book-entry shall be subject to comparable restrictions and corresponding stop transfer instructions. Upon the vesting of Shares of Restricted Stock, and the Company's determination that any necessary conditions precedent to the release of vested Shares (such as satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and compliance with applicable legal requirements) have been satisfied, such vested Shares shall be made available to the Participant in such manner as may be prescribed or permitted by the Committee. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or an applicable Agreement, a Participant with a Restricted Stock Award shall have all the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote the Shares of Restricted Stock.
10.      Stock Unit Awards.
(a)      Vesting and Consideration. A Stock Unit Award shall be subject to vesting and the lapse of applicable restrictions based on such conditions or factors and occurring over such period of time as the Committee may determine in its discretion. If vesting of a Stock Unit Award is conditioned on the achievement of specified performance goals, the extent to which they are achieved over the specified performance period shall determine the number of Stock Units that will be earned and eligible to vest, which may be greater or less than the target number of Stock Units stated in the Agreement. The Committee may provide whether any consideration other than Services must be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the settlement of a Stock Unit Award.
(b)      Settlement of Award. Following the vesting of a Stock Unit Award, and the Company's determination that any necessary conditions precedent to the settlement of the Award (such as satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and compliance with applicable legal requirements) have been satisfied, settlement of the Award and payment to the Participant shall be made at such time or times in the form of cash, Shares (which may themselves be considered Restricted Stock under the Plan) or a combination of cash and Shares as determined by the Committee.
11.      Other Stock-Based Awards. The Committee may from time to time grant Shares and other Awards that are valued by reference to and/or payable in whole or in part in Shares under the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, which shall be consistent with the terms and purposes of the Plan. The Committee may direct the Company to issue Shares subject to restrictive legends and/or stop transfer instructions that are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Award to which the Shares relate.
12.      Changes in Capitalization, Corporate Transactions, Change in Control. 
(a)      Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any equity restructuring (within the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718) that causes the per share value of Shares to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering or recapitalization through an extraordinary dividend, the Committee shall make such adjustments as it deems equitable and appropriate to (i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares or other securities issued or reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the number and kind of Shares or other securities subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the exercise price of outstanding Options and SARs, and (iv) any maximum limitations prescribed by the Plan with respect to certain types of Awards or the grants to individuals of certain types of Awards. In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization, including a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such equitable adjustments described in the foregoing sentence may be made as determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights of Participants.  In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.  No adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section 12(a) in connection with the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company, or in a manner that would cause Incentive Stock Options to violate Section 422(b) of the Code or cause an Award to be subject to adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
(b)      Corporate Transactions. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement or another written agreement between a Participant and the Company, the following provisions shall apply to outstanding Awards in the event of a Change in Control that involves a Corporate Transaction.
(1)      Continuation, Assumption or Replacement of Awards. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, then the surviving or successor entity (or its Parent) may continue, assume or replace Awards outstanding as of the date of the Corporate Transaction (with such adjustments as may be required or permitted by Section 12(a)), and such Awards or replacements therefor shall remain outstanding and be governed by their respective terms, subject to Section 12(b)(4) below. A surviving or successor entity may elect to continue, assume or replace only some Awards or portions of Awards. For purposes of this Section 12(b)(1), an Award shall be considered assumed or replaced if, in connection with the Corporate Transaction and in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A (and Code Section 424 if the Award is an ISO), either (i) the contractual obligations represented by the Award are expressly assumed by the surviving or successor entity (or its Parent) with appropriate adjustments to the number and type of securities subject to the Award and the exercise price thereof that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Corporate Transaction, or (ii) the Participant has received a comparable equity-based award that preserves the intrinsic value of the Award existing at the time of the Corporate Transaction and contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those of the Award.
(2)      Acceleration. If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then (i) all outstanding Option and SAR Awards shall become fully vested and exercisable for such period of time prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction as is deemed fair and equitable by the Committee, and shall terminate at the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, (ii) all outstanding Full Value Awards shall fully vest immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, and (iii) to the extent vesting of any Award is subject to satisfaction of specified performance goals, such Award shall be deemed "fully vested" for purposes of this Section 12(b)(2) if the performance goals are deemed to have been satisfied at the target level of performance and the vested portion of the Award at that level of performance is proportionate to the portion of the performance period that has elapsed as of the effective time of the Corporate Transaction. The Committee shall provide written notice of the period of accelerated exercisability of Option and SAR Awards to all affected Participants. The exercise of any Option or SAR Award whose exercisability is accelerated as provided in this Section 12(b)(2) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Corporate Transaction and shall be effective only immediately before such consummation.
(3)      Payment for Awards. If and to the extent that outstanding Awards under the Plan are not continued, assumed or replaced in connection with a Corporate Transaction, then the Committee may provide that some or all of such outstanding Awards shall be canceled at or immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction in exchange for payments to the holders as provided in this Section 12(b)(3). The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly for purposes of this Section 12(b)(3). The payment for any Award canceled shall be in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Committee) of the consideration that would otherwise be received in the Corporate Transaction for the number of Shares subject to the Award, and (ii) the aggregate exercise price (if any) for the Shares subject to such Award. If the amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence is not a positive number with respect to any Award, such Award may be canceled pursuant to this Section 12(b)(3) without payment of any kind to the affected Participant. With respect to an Award whose vesting is subject to the satisfaction of specified performance goals, the number of Shares subject to such an Award for purposes of this Section 12(b)(3) shall be the number of Shares as to which the Award would have been deemed "fully vested" for purposes of Section 12(b)(2). Payment of any amount under this Section 12(b)(3) shall be made in such form, on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion, which may or may not be the same as the form, terms and conditions applicable to payments to the Company's shareholders in connection with the Corporate Transaction, and may, in the Committee's discretion, include subjecting such payments to vesting conditions comparable to those of the Award canceled, subjecting such payments to escrow or holdback terms comparable to those imposed upon the Company's shareholders under the Corporate Transaction, or calculating and paying the present value of payments that would otherwise be subject to escrow or holdback terms.
(4)      Termination After a Corporate Transaction. If and to the extent that Awards are continued, assumed or replaced under the circumstances described in Section 12(b)(1), and if within 12 months after the Corporate Transaction a Participant experiences an involuntary termination of Service for reasons other than Cause, then (i) outstanding Option and SAR Awards issued to the Participant that are not yet fully exercisable shall immediately become exercisable in full and shall remain exercisable for 30 days following the Participant's termination of employment, and (ii) any Full Value Awards that are not yet fully vested shall immediately vest in full (with vesting in full for a performance-based award determined as provided in Section 12(b)(2), except that the proportionate vesting amount will be determined with respect to the portion of the performance period during which the Participant was a Service Provider).
(c)      Other Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control that does not involve a Corporate Transaction, the Committee may, in its discretion, take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding Awards, which may include: (i)  providing for the cancellation of any Award in exchange for payments in a manner similar to that provided in Section 12(b)(3) or (ii) making such adjustments to the Awards then outstanding as the Committee deems appropriate to reflect such Change in Control, which may include the acceleration of vesting in full or in part. The Committee will not be required to treat all Awards similarly in such circumstances, and may include such further provisions and limitations in any Award Agreement as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company.
(d)      Dissolution or Liquidation. Unless otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement, in the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Committee will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. An Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
(e)      Parachute Payment Limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, if any of the payments or benefits provided or to be provided by the Company or its Affiliates to a Participant or for the Participant's benefit pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise ("Covered Payments") constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and would, but for this Section 12(e) be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) or any similar tax imposed by state or local law and any interest or penalties with respect to such taxes (collectively, the "Excise Tax"), then the Covered Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the minimum extent necessary to ensure that no portion of the Covered Payments is subject to the Excise Tax.
13.      Plan Participation and Service Provider Status. Status as a Service Provider shall not be construed as a commitment that any Award will be made under the Plan to that Service Provider or to eligible Service Providers generally. Nothing in the Plan or in any Agreement or related documents shall confer upon any Service Provider or Participant any right to continued Service with the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall it interfere with or limit in any way any right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the person's Service at any time with or without Cause or change such person's compensation, other benefits, job responsibilities or title.
14.      Tax Withholding. The Company or any Affiliate, as applicable, shall have the right to (i) withhold from any cash payment under the Plan or any other compensation owed to a Participant an amount sufficient to cover any required withholding taxes related to the grant, vesting, exercise or settlement of an Award, and (ii) require a Participant or other person receiving Shares under the Plan to pay a cash amount sufficient to cover any required withholding taxes before actual receipt of those Shares. In lieu of all or any part of a cash payment from a person receiving Shares under the Plan, the Committee may permit the Participant to satisfy all or any part of the required tax withholding obligations (but not to exceed the maximum individual statutory tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction) by authorizing the Company to withhold a number of the Shares that would otherwise be delivered to the Participant pursuant to the Award, or by transferring to the Company Shares already owned by the Participant, with the Shares so withheld or delivered having a Fair Market Value on the date the taxes are required to be withheld equal to the amount of taxes to be withheld.
15.      Effective Date, Duration, Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
(a)      Effective Date. The Plan shall become effective on the date it is approved by the Company's shareholders, which shall be considered the date of its adoption for purposes of Treasury Regulation §1.422-2(b)(2)(i). No Awards shall be made under the Plan prior to its effective date. If the Company's shareholders fail to approve the Plan by February 28, 2020, the Plan will be of no further force or effect.
(b)     Duration of the Plan. The Plan shall remain in effect until all Shares subject to it are distributed, all Awards have expired or terminated, the Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 15(c), or the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan, whichever occurs first (the "Termination Date"). Awards made before the Termination Date shall continue to be outstanding in accordance with their terms and the terms of the Plan unless otherwise provided in the applicable Agreements.
(c)      Amendment and Termination of the Plan. The Board may at any time terminate, suspend or amend the Plan. The Company shall submit any amendment of the Plan to its shareholders for approval only to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Shares may then be listed. No termination, suspension, or amendment of the Plan may materially impair the rights of any Participant under a previously granted Award without the Participant's consent, unless such action is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules.  
(d)      Amendment of Awards. Subject to Section 15(e), the Committee may unilaterally amend the terms of any Agreement evidencing an Award previously granted, except that no such amendment may materially impair the rights of any Participant under the applicable Award without the Participant's consent, unless such amendment is necessary to comply with applicable law or stock exchange rules or any compensation recovery policy as provided in Section 16(i).
(e)      No Option or SAR Repricing. Except as provided in Section 12(a), no Option or Stock Appreciation Right Award granted under the Plan may be (i) amended to decrease the exercise price thereof, (ii) cancelled in conjunction with the grant of any new Option or Stock Appreciation Right Award with a lower exercise price, (iii) cancelled in exchange for cash, other property or the grant of any Full Value Award at a time when the per share exercise price of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right Award is greater than the current Fair Market Value of a Share, or (iv) otherwise subject to any action that would be treated under accounting rules as a "repricing" of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right Award, unless such action is first approved by the Company's shareholders.
16.      Other Provisions.
(a)      Unfunded Plan. The Plan shall be unfunded and the Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards under the Plan. Neither the Company, its Affiliates, the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan nor shall anything contained in the Plan or any action taken pursuant to its provisions create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and/or its Affiliates, and a Participant. To the extent any person has or acquires a right to receive a payment in connection with an Award under the Plan, this right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
(b)      Limits of Liability. Except as may be required by law, neither the Company nor any member of the Board or of the Committee, nor any other person participating (including participation pursuant to a delegation of authority under Section 3(c) of the Plan) in any determination of any question under the Plan, or in the interpretation, administration or application of the Plan, shall have any liability to any party for any action taken, or not taken, in good faith under the Plan.
(c)      Compliance with Applicable Legal Requirements and Company Policies. No Shares distributable pursuant to the Plan shall be issued and delivered unless and until the issuance of the Shares complies with all applicable legal requirements, including compliance with the provisions of applicable state and federal securities laws, and the requirements of any securities exchanges on which the Company's Shares may, at the time, be listed. During any period in which the offering and issuance of Shares under the Plan is not registered under federal or state securities laws, Participants shall acknowledge that they are acquiring Shares under the Plan for investment purposes and not for resale, and that Shares may not be transferred except pursuant to an effective registration statement under, or an exemption from the registration requirements of, such securities laws. Any stock certificate or book-entry evidencing Shares issued under the Plan that are subject to securities law restrictions shall bear or be accompanied by an appropriate restrictive legend or stop transfer instruction. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the acquisition, holding or disposition of Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan shall in all events be subject to compliance with applicable Company policies, including those relating to insider trading, pledging or hedging transactions, minimum post-vesting holding periods and stock ownership guidelines, and to forfeiture or recovery of compensation as provided in Section 16(i).
(d)      Other Benefit and Compensation Programs. Payments and other benefits received by a Participant under an Award made pursuant to the Plan shall not be deemed a part of a Participant's regular, recurring compensation for purposes of the termination, indemnity or severance pay laws of any country and shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits under any other employee benefit plan, contract or similar arrangement provided by the Company or an Affiliate unless expressly so provided by such other plan, contract or arrangement, or unless the Committee expressly determines that an Award or portion of an Award should be included to accurately reflect competitive compensation practices or to recognize that an Award has been made in lieu of a portion of competitive cash compensation.
(e)      Governing Law. To the extent that federal laws do not otherwise control, the Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant to the Plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts-of-law principles and shall be construed accordingly.
(f)      Severability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
(g)     Code Section 409A. It is intended that (i) all Awards of Options, SARs and Restricted Stock under the Plan will not provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A and thereby be exempt from Code Section 409A, and (ii) all other Awards under the Plan will either not provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A, or will comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and Awards shall be structured and the Plan administered and interpreted in accordance with this intent. The Plan and any Agreement may be unilaterally amended by the Company in any manner deemed necessary or advisable by the Committee or Board in order to maintain such exemption from or compliance with Code Section 409A, and any such amendment shall conclusively be presumed to be necessary to comply with applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or any Agreement, with respect to any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Code Section 409A:
(1)     If any amount is payable under such Award upon a termination of Service, a termination of Service will be deemed to have occurred only at such time as the Participant has experienced a "separation from service" as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A;
(2)     If any amount shall be payable with respect to any such Award as a result of a Participant's "separation from service" at such time as the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then no payment shall be made, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after the Participant's separation from service or (ii) the Participant's death. Unless the Committee has adopted a specified employee identification policy as contemplated by Code Section 409A, specified employees will be identified in accordance with the default provisions specified under Code Section 409A.
None of the Company, the Board, the Committee nor any other person involved with the administration of this Plan shall (i) in any way be responsible for ensuring the exemption of any Award from, or compliance by any Award with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, (ii) have any obligation to design or administer the Plan or Awards granted thereunder in a manner that minimizes a Participant's tax liabilities, including the avoidance of any additional tax liabilities under Code Section 409A, and (iii) shall have any liability to any Participant for any such tax liabilities.
(h)     Rule 16b-3. It is intended that the Plan and all Awards granted pursuant to it shall be administered by the Committee so as to permit the Plan and Awards to comply with Exchange Act Rule 16b-3. If any provision of the Plan or of any Award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with the intent expressed in this Section 16(h), that provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and deemed amended in the manner determined by the Committee so as to avoid the conflict. To the extent of any remaining irreconcilable conflict with this intent, the provision shall be deemed void as applied to Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by law and in the manner deemed advisable by the Committee.
(i)     Forfeiture and Compensation Recovery.
(1)      The Committee may specify in an Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recovery by the Company upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include termination of Service for Cause; violation of any material Company or Affiliate policy; breach of noncompetition, non-solicitation or confidentiality provisions that apply to the Participant; a determination that the payment of the Award was based on an incorrect determination that financial or other criteria were met or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or its Affiliates.
(2)      Awards and any compensation associated therewith may be made subject to forfeiture, recovery by the Company or other action pursuant to any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Board or the Committee at any time, including in response to the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, or as otherwise required by law. Any Agreement may be unilaterally amended by the Committee to comply with any such compensation recovery policy.
