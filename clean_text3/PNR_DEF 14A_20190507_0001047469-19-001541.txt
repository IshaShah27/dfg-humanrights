   LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS    
        John L. Stauch Pentair President and   Chief Executive Officer   Looking back at 2018, we are proud of the progress we made as we began our journey as the "new Pentair." On April 30, 2018, we transferred our electrical business to nVent Electric plc and spun off nVent as a  public company to shareholders, retaining our water business as a residential and commercial water treatment company. As a pure play water company, we offer a comprehensive range of smart, sustainable water solutions to homes, businesses and  industries around the world. Our industry leading and proven portfolio of solutions enables our customers to access clean, safe water. Whether it's moving, improving, or enjoying water, we help manage the world's most precious resource.     2018: A Successful First Year      As the "new Pentair," we developed a detailed and executable residential and commercial water treatment strategy. Consumers today are increasingly concerned about water quality. Homeowners want to be empowered to improve the health of their water  inside their homes and commercial customers want quality, consistency and efficiency. Our solutions offer not only great tasting water, but peace of mind for those concerned about the health and taste of their water. 
[END TABLE]
Delivering smart, sustainable solutions is articulated in our new purpose, mission and vision, brought to life through our approximately 10,000 employees and showcased on our website. The new website is part of our digital transformation in creating the online experience our customers are expecting as we transition from a business-to-business industrial company to an omni-channel water treatment organization. 
   Delivering on Our Commitments  
In our first year, we delivered on our financial 2018 commitments despite the impact of tariffs and inflation. In addition to solid financial performance, we returned nearly $700 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Our cash generation remained strong and our balance sheet continued to be in great shape. 
Our Aquatic Systems business, with a broad product offering and leading technology for both residential and commercial customers, exceeded $1 billion in sales in 2018. Our 2018 sales were up 9 percent, driven by our technology leadership, dealer intimacy and our aftermarket support. Advancing growth in our pool business continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy. 
Filtration Solutions, which has strong, respected brands and leading technology, delivered approximately $1 billion in sales in 2018. The segment's sales were up 1 percent driven by strong distribution capabilities and technical support. We offer complete product solutions for under-sink and over-sink filtration, as well as whole house water treatment systems. 
Flow Technologies, with 2018 sales up 3 percent, provides complete pump solutions through broad product offerings, with deep product application expertise in both residential and commercial as well as in the agriculture industry. 
   Imagining Water's Future: Pentair is Well Positioned for 2019 and Beyond  
We've established technology innovation centers, where we are not only looking at new technologies, but also new applications to apply those technologies. We see tremendous opportunity to build IoT-enabled whole home and point-of-use solutions. For example, our residential pool business recently launched the Pentair IntelliCenter Control Center for pool and spa which allows pool owners to conveniently and easily monitor and control their pool's functions via a user-friendly app from anywhere in the world — or right at home. 
From a strategic perspective, this is important when you look at the footprint of all our products within the residential space. Nearly everything that has to do with water in your home, we touch. Whether it is water treatment for the whole home, water filtration under your sink, the enjoyment of water in your pool, water supply and disposal, leak detection or flood control for your basement, Pentair has solutions. We have an exciting road map for developing products with smart, connected technology to create differentiated innovation aligned with our strategy. 
Also, we recently completed two acquisitions, Pelican Water Systems and Aquion, which further advances our strategy by adding new and complementary products to the Pentair portfolio, and expanding our scope to better meet consumer residential water needs. Aquion brings a national affiliated dealer network under its RainSoft brand, and Pelican brings a direct-to-consumer model through a proprietary e-commerce platform, as well as a number of innovative water treatment systems and services. 
Going forward we will continue to invest in our prioritized strategies, focusing on smart, sustainable solutions that empower our customers to make the most of life's essential resource. We are energized about the future and our ability to deliver for you, our shareholder. 
Thank you for your support, 
John L. Stauch  Pentair President and CEO

   COMPANY OVERVIEW*  
[END TABLE]
At Pentair, we believe the health of our world depends on reliable access to clean, safe water. Our mission is to deliver smart, sustainable solutions that empower our customers to make the most of life's essential resource. Our vision is to be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company built through empowered employees delivering for customers and creating value for shareholders. 
2018 represented a historic year for Pentair. On April 30, 2018, we transferred our electrical business to nVent Electric plc ("nVent") and spun off nVent as a public company to our shareholders (the "Separation") and retained our water business as a "pure play" residential and commercial water treatment company. Upon the Separation, a new leadership team was put in place for Pentair, with John L. Stauch becoming our new President and Chief Executive Officer. Also in connection with the Separation, we made changes to our Board of Directors (the "Board") and concluded 2018 with a mix of directors that we believe positions us well with a mix of longer-tenured directors who provide institutional knowledge regarding our company and shorter-tenured directors who provide fresh perspectives. 
The Separation created a unique opportunity for us to focus on our people, processes, and Win Right Values in order to be in the best position to deliver on our vision and strategy. Also, after the Separation, we became a smaller company, which we believe is well-positioned for focused and strategic growth as we look to the future. At the end of 2018, and after the Separation, we had approximately 10,000 employees and 2018 net sales from continuing operations of $2.97 billion, as compared to the end of 2017 and before the Separation, when we had approximately 18,000 employees and reported 2017 net sales of $4.94 billion. 
With a new, more focused Pentair and with our new mission and vision, we ended 2018 delivering on our commitments to shareholders and exceeding our 2017 performance on critical measures. In 2018 as compared to 2017, we increased our earnings per share from continuing operations ("EPS") by 191.9%, we increased our adjusted EPS by 21.1%, and we increased our segment income by 8.1%. Our net sales grew 4.2% during 2018 compared to 2017, and free cash flow was $410 million for 2018, representing a conversion of 98.5% of our adjusted net income to free cash flow.

   Board Overview  
[END TABLE]
Directors are chosen with a view to bringing to the Board a variety of rich backgrounds and financial and management expertise, and establishing a core of strategic and business advisers. 
The composition of the Board changed significantly in 2018 in connection with the Separation. Jerry W. Burris, Carol Anthony (John) Davidson, Edward P. Garden, David H. Y. Ho, Randall J. Hogan, Ronald L. Merriman, and William T. Monahan resigned as directors effective April 30, 2018, and the Board elected Theodore L. Harris, Matthew H. Peltz, Michael T. Speetzen, and John L. Stauch as new directors effective April 30, 2018. At the 2018 Annual General Meeting, our shareholders re-elected the Board, consisting of Glynis A. Bryan, Jacques Esculier, T. Michael Glenn, Mr. Harris, David A. Jones, Mr. Peltz, Mr. Speetzen, Mr. Stauch, and Billie I. Williamson, and approved the reduction of the minimum number of directors to seven and the maximum number of directors to eleven. Mr. Peltz of Trian Fund Management, L.P. later resigned as a director effective September 10, 2018. We believe the composition of our current Board provides a good mix of tenure and diversity. Also, all of our Directors are independent except Mr. Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer.

   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS  
[END TABLE]
These executive compensation highlights should be read in connection with the "Executive Compensation" below, including "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" (see page 29). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Our Compensation Philosophy   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that the most effective executive compensation program aligns executive initiatives with shareholders' economic interests. The Compensation Committee seeks to accomplish this objective by rewarding the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals that create lasting shareholder value. The Compensation Committee's specific objectives include: 
To balance these objectives, our executive compensation program uses the following direct compensation elements: 
The Compensation Committee reviews total compensation for executive officers and the relative levels of each form of compensation against the Compensation Committee's goals. As such, our executive compensation program is predominantly performance-based, which encourages our executive officers to focus on our company's long-term success and aligns with the long-term interests of our shareholders. 
The charts below illustrate the targeted mix of fixed, annual, and long-term incentive compensation we provided in 2018 to our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers who are named in the Summary Compensation Table below (the "Named Executive Officers") (but excluding our previous Chief Executive Officer). These charts also illustrate the amount of target direct compensation that was tied to achievement of performance goals.

PROXY SUMMARY
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Summary of Separation-Related Compensation Actions   
[END TABLE]
In connection with the Separation, the Compensation Committee took a number of actions to align our executive compensation program for the new Pentair as a pure play residential and commercial water treatment company. First, the Compensation Committee worked with its external compensation consultant to develop an updated peer group and comparative framework that better reflected our post-Separation business focus and smaller company size. The Compensation Committee took that comparative framework into consideration when setting compensation for Pentair's new leadership team, composed of both internal promotions as well as external new hires. The Compensation Committee set annual and long-term incentive compensation metrics and targets appropriate for Pentair's new strategic priorities and financial goals. Additional actions taken related to the Separation are further discussed below in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Shareholder Outreach and Say on Pay   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to maintain an open dialogue with our shareholders to gain input on their perspectives regarding our executive compensation program and to provide clarifying information enabling them to make informed decisions in our annual nonbinding, advisory shareholder vote (our "say on pay vote") on the compensation of our executive officers named in our Proxy Statement. In 2018, we maintained our shareholder outreach to gain additional insight, better understand shareholder perspectives, and evaluate any concerns regarding our executive compensation program. Additionally, we took the opportunity to discuss the impact of the Separation on our executive compensation program and treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards. 
Our 2018 shareholder outreach included 35 of our largest shareholders representing 68% of our outstanding shares. The majority of shareholders we spoke with supported our executive compensation program and the changes adopted over the last several years. This support was also reflected in the results of the say on pay vote at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, with approximately 93% of votes cast in favor of our proposal. 
We consider shareholder engagement to be a very important process in how we approach our executive compensation program, and we intend to continue shareholder outreach.

     DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE  
[END TABLE]
The Board, based on the recommendation of the Governance Committee, determines the independence of each director based upon the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards and the categorical standards of independence included in our Corporate Governance Principles. Based on these standards, the Board has affirmatively determined that all of our non-employee director nominees (i.e., Mses. Bryan and Williamson and Messrs. Esculier, Glenn, Harris, Jones, and Speetzen) are independent and have no material relationship with us (including our directors and officers) that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment. The Board has affirmatively determined that our President and Chief Executive Officer, John L. Stauch, is not independent. 
In determining independence, our Board and Governance Committee consider circumstances where a director serves as an employee of another company that is a customer or supplier. The Board and Committee have reviewed each of these relationships, which are set forth below. In every case, the relationship involves sales to or purchases from the other company that, for each of 2016, 2017, and 2018, were (a) less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of that organization's consolidated gross revenues during each of 2016, 2017, and 2018; and (b) not of an amount or nature that impeded the director's exercise of independent judgment. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS; DIVERSITY AND TENURE  
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee and the Board recognize that the Board's contributions and effectiveness depend on the character and abilities of each director individually as well as on their collective strengths. Accordingly, the Governance Committee and the Board evaluate candidates based on several criteria. Directors are chosen with a view to bringing to the Board a variety of experiences and backgrounds and establishing a core of strategic and business advisers with financial and management expertise. The Governance Committee and the Board also consider candidates with substantial experience outside the business community, such as in the public, academic or scientific communities. In addition, the Governance Committee and the Board consider the tenure of incumbent directors, with the goal of having a mix of shorter-tenured directors who provide fresh perspectives and longer-tenured directors who provide institutional knowledge regarding our company and our business. 
When considering candidates for election as directors, the Governance Committee and the Board are guided by the following principles, found in our Corporate Governance Principles:

Table of Contents
PROPOSAL 1
Our policies on director qualifications emphasize our commitment to diversity at the Board level — diversity not only of gender, sexual orientation, race, religion or national origin but also diversity of experience, expertise and training. The Governance Committee in the first instance is charged with observing these policies, and strives in reviewing each candidate to assess the fit of his or her qualifications with the needs of the Board and our company at that time, given the then current mix of directors' attributes. Board composition, effectiveness and processes are all subject areas of our annual Board self-assessment, which is described in more detail below under "Board and Committee Self-Assessments." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   SHAREHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS, NOMINATIONS AND PROXY ACCESS  
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the Governance Committee will consider persons properly recommended by shareholders to become nominees for election as directors in accordance with the criteria described above under "Directors Qualifications; Diversity and Tenure." Recommendations for consideration by the Governance Committee, together with appropriate biographical information concerning each proposed nominee, should be sent in writing to c/o Corporate Secretary, Pentair plc, Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, London, TW1 3QS, United Kingdom. 
Our Articles of Association set forth procedures to be followed by shareholders who wish to nominate candidates for election as directors in connection with an Annual General Meeting. All such nominations must be accompanied by certain background and other information specified in the Articles of Association and submitted within the timing requirements set forth in the Articles of Association. See "Shareholder Proposals and Nominations for the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders" below for more information. 
In addition, eligible shareholders may under certain circumstances be able to nominate and include in our proxy materials a specified number of candidates for election as directors under the proxy access provisions in our Articles of Association.

     THE BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Risk Oversight   
[END TABLE]
The Board is responsible for general oversight of our risk management. The Board focuses on the most significant and material risks facing us and helps to ensure that management develops and implements controls and appropriate risk mitigation strategies. 
At the direction of the Board, we have instituted an enterprise-wide risk management system that identifies potential exposure to risks that arise in the course of our business, including strategic, operational, financial, cybersecurity, information technology, and legal and regulatory compliance risks. Our senior management is responsible for the administration of the enterprise-wide risk management system. To that end, senior management assesses and monitors potential risks and develops mitigation strategies to address those potential risks. 
The Board has determined that the Board as a whole, and not a separate committee, will oversee our enterprise risk management process. Each of our Board Committees has historically focused and continues to focus on specific risks within its respective area of responsibility and regularly reports to the full Board. The Audit and Finance Committee focuses on accounting and financial controls, financial statement integrity, financial risk exposures, and tax policy and compliance. The Compensation Committee reviews risks related to our compensation programs and policies as discussed further below under "Risk Considerations in Compensation Decisions." The Governance Committee considers risks related to our corporate governance structure and processes, including director qualifications and independence, as well as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate-related compliance matters. 
The Board uses our enterprise-wide risk management system as a key tool for understanding the risks facing us as well as assessing whether management's processes, procedures and practices for mitigating those risks are effective. Our General Counsel is the primary person responsible to the Board in the planning, assessment and reporting of our risk profile and this risk management system. The Board reviews and discusses an assessment of and a report on our risk profile on a regular basis, including reports on strategic, operational, financial, cybersecurity, information technology, and legal and regulatory compliance risks. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Oversight in Company Strategy   
[END TABLE]
At least once per year, the Board and senior management engage in an in-depth strategic review of our company's outlook and strategy, which is designed to create long-term shareholder value and serves as the foundation upon which goals are established. Throughout the year, the Board reviews our strategy and monitors management's progress against such goals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Oversight in Succession Planning   
[END TABLE]
The Board views its role in succession planning and talent development as a key responsibility. At least once per year, usually as part of the annual talent review process, the Board discusses and reviews the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer position and other executive officers and key contributors. The Board becomes familiar with potential successors for key management positions through various means, including annual talent reviews, presentations to the Board, and communications outside of meetings. Our succession planning process is an organization-wide practice designed to proactively identify, develop and retain the leadership talent that is critical for our future business success. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Communicating with Shareholders and Other Stakeholders   
[END TABLE]
We believe that maintaining an active dialogue with our shareholders is important to our long-term success. We value the opinions of our shareholders and other stakeholders and welcome their views throughout the year on key issues. During 2018, we continued our shareholder outreach on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Our 2018 shareholder outreach included 35 of our largest shareholders, representing 68% of our outstanding shares.

   Policies and Procedures Regarding Related Person Transactions   
[END TABLE]
Our Board has adopted written policies and procedures regarding related person transactions. For purposes of these policies and procedures: 
Potential related person transactions must be disclosed in the manner required in our Articles of Association and be brought to the attention of the Governance Committee directly or to the General Counsel for transmission to the Committee. Disclosure to the Governance Committee should occur before, if possible, or as soon as practicable after the related person transaction is effected, but in any event as soon as practicable after the executive officer or director becomes aware of the related person transaction. The Governance Committee's decision whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction is to be made in light of a number of factors, including the following: 
We had no related person transactions during 2018. To our knowledge, no related person transactions are currently proposed. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   BOARD STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES    
[END TABLE]
We and our Board are committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and ethics. As part of this commitment, the Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Principles that sets forth our policies on: 
The Board regularly reviews and, if appropriate, revises the Corporate Governance Principles and other governance instruments, including the charters of its Audit and Finance, Compensation, and Governance Committees, in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the NYSE. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and has designated it as the code of ethics for our Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers.

   Board Leadership Structure   
[END TABLE]
We do not have a policy requiring the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be held by different persons. Rather, the Board has the discretion to determine whether the positions should be combined or separated. Since 2018, and in connection with the Separation, the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board have been separated. 
Mr. Stauch is our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Jones, an independent member of the Board, serves as Chairman of the Board. The role of the Chairman is to provide independent leadership to the Board, act as liaison between and among the non-employee directors and our company, and seek to ensure that the Board operates independently of management. The Chairman's principal responsibilities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board and Committee Self-Assessments   
[END TABLE]
The Board annually conducts a self-assessment of the Board and each Committee. In 2018, the assessment process consisted of a written evaluation comprising both quantitative scoring and narrative comments on a range of topics, including the composition and structure of the Board, the type and frequency of communications and information provided to the Board and the Committees, the Board's effectiveness in carrying out its functions and responsibilities, the effectiveness of the Committee structure, directors' 
preparation and participation in the meetings, and the values and culture displayed by the directors. The evaluation responses were compiled by a third party and shared with the Chairman of the Board and Governance Committee Chair who led a discussion of the assessment results at the following Board meeting. 
In addition, a verbal assessment is conducted in independent executive session at the end of every Board and Committee meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Education   
[END TABLE]
Board education is an ongoing, year-round process, which begins when a director joins our Board. Upon joining our Board, new directors are provided with a comprehensive orientation to our company, including our business, strategy and governance. For example, new directors typically participate in one-on-one introductory meetings with our senior business and functional leaders. On an ongoing basis, directors receive presentations on a variety of topics related to their work on the Board and within the industry, both from senior management and from experts outside of our company, including attending a company culture session in 2018. Directors may also enroll in continuing education programs sponsored by third parties at our expense.

   ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS    
[END TABLE]
The Board held six meetings in 2018. Members of the Board are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of the Board and the Committees on which they serve and all Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings. All directors attended 100% of the meetings of the Board and all meetings of the Committees on which they served during the period for which such persons served as directors in 2018. In each regularly scheduled meeting, the independent directors also met in executive session, without the Chief Executive Officer or other members of management present. All of the directors then-serving attended the 2018 Annual General Meeting in person, except for Mr. Esculier, who attended by telephone. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   DIRECTOR COMPENSATION    
[END TABLE]
Director compensation is determined by the Governance Committee of the Board. We use a combination of cash and equity-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors. Compensation of our directors reflects our belief that a significant portion of directors' compensation should be tied to long-term growth in shareholder value. 
Mr. Stauch, our only employee-director, is not, and will not be, separately compensated for service as a member of the Board. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director Retainers   
[END TABLE]
The annual retainers for non-employee directors' service on the Board and Board Committees prior to the Separation in 2018 were as follows:

Aon Hewitt reviewed our director compensation with the Governance Committee during 2017, in light of the anticipated changes to our peer group for benchmarking executive compensation following the Separation. As a result of such review, the annual retainers for non-employee directors' service on the Board and Board Committees were reduced after the Separation in 2018 to the following levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Board Retainer   $80,000     
      Non-Employee Director Chair   $140,000     
      Audit and Finance Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $20,000     
      Compensation Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $15,000     
      Governance Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $12,000     
      Audit and Finance Committee Retainer   $12,500     
      Compensation Committee Retainer   $7,500     
      Governance Committee Retainer   $7,500     
[END TABLE]
In December 2018, Aon Hewitt again reviewed our director compensation with the Governance Committee based on the director compensation practices of such peer group. As a result of such review, certain annual retainers for non-employee directors' service on the Board and Board Committees were increased. The compensation for the Board of Directors in 2019 is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Board Retainer   $90,000     
      Non-Employee Director Chair   $140,000     
      Audit and Finance Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $22,750     
      Compensation Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $15,000     
      Governance Committee Chair Supplemental Retainer   $15,000     
      Audit and Finance Committee Retainer   $13,500     
      Compensation Committee Retainer   $7,500     
      Governance Committee Retainer   $7,500     
[END TABLE]
In addition, based on such review by Aon Hewitt, we adopted in December 2018 a policy to provide, beginning in 2019, a tax equalization payment to non-employee directors on any United Kingdom taxes that may be paid on account of our company's payment of, or reimbursement for, travel, lodging and meal expenses incidental to Board and Board Committee meetings and reimbursement of fees and expenses in connection with assistance in the preparation of United Kingdom tax returns and any United Kingdom taxes on such payment or reimbursement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Equity Awards   
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors receive an annual equity grant under the Pentair plc 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan ("Pentair plc 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan") as a part of their compensation. Beginning in 2018, non-employee directors received the full value of their annual equity grant in the form of restricted stock units and ceased receiving annual grants in the form of stock options. Restricted stock units vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one ordinary share upon vesting and includes one dividend equivalent unit, which entitles the holder to all cash dividends declared on one ordinary share from and after the date of grant. 
In connection with the Separation, non-employee directors received their annual grant for 2018 on May 2, 2018 valued at $130,000. Based on the review of director compensation by Aon Hewitt, the annual grant for 2019 was valued at $140,000 and was granted on January 2, 2019.

   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION    
[END TABLE]
  In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Board is asking the shareholders to approve, by nonbinding, advisory vote, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers disclosed in the sections below titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation Tables." We currently hold these votes annually. 
Executive compensation is an important matter to the Board and the Compensation Committee and to our shareholders. We have designed our executive compensation program to align executive and shareholder interests by rewarding the achievement of specific annual, long-term, and strategic goals that create long-term shareholder value. We believe that our executive compensation program provides competitive compensation that motivates and rewards executives for achieving financial and strategic objectives, provides rewards commensurate with performance to incentivize the Named Executive Officers to perform at their highest levels, encourages growth and innovation, attracts and retains the Named Executive Officers and other key executives, and aligns our executive compensation with shareholders' interests through the use of equity-based incentive awards. 
The Compensation Committee has overseen the development and implementation of our executive compensation program in line with these compensation objectives. The Compensation Committee continuously reviews, evaluates and updates our executive compensation program to ensure that we provide competitive compensation that motivates the Named Executive Officers to perform at their highest levels while increasing long-term value to our shareholders. 
With these compensation objectives in mind, the Compensation Committee has taken a number of compensation actions to align with our shareholders' interests, including the following: 
As described in detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Shareholder Outreach and Say on Pay," we continued shareholder outreach in 2018. 
These and other actions demonstrate our continued commitment to align executive compensation with shareholders' interests while providing competitive compensation to attract, motivate and retain the Named Executive Officers and other key executives. We will continue to review and adjust our executive compensation program with these goals in mind to ensure the long-term success of our company and generate increased long-term value to our shareholders. 
This nonbinding, advisory vote gives you an opportunity to express your views about our executive compensation program. As we further align our executive compensation program with the interests of our shareholders while continuing to retain key talented executives who drive our company's success, we ask that you approve the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. 
The resolution in respect of this Proposal 2 is an ordinary resolution. The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal 2 is as follows: 
"IT IS RESOLVED, that, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of Pentair plc's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related disclosures contained in Pentair plc's Proxy Statement is hereby approved."

   2018 HIGHLIGHTS AND BUSINESS RESULTS*  
[END TABLE]
2018 represented a historic year for Pentair. On April 30, 2018, we transferred our electrical business to nVent Electric plc ("nVent") and spun off nVent as a public company to our shareholders (the "Separation") and retained our water business as a "pure play" residential and commercial water treatment company (the "new Pentair"). Also in connection with the Separation, we reported the historical financial results of the electrical business as discontinued operations. See our consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 19, 2019 for more information. 
At the Separation, a new leadership team was put in place for Pentair, with Mr. Stauch becoming our new President and Chief Executive Officer upon the completion of the Separation. Our Named Executive Officers in 2018 were Mr. Stauch as well Mark C. Borin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Karl R. Frykman, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Karla C. Robertson, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; Philip M. Rolchigo, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer; and Randall J. Hogan, our previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who led our company for 18 years and retired at the time of the Separation. 
The Separation created a unique opportunity for us to focus on our people, processes, and Win Right Values in order to be in the best position to deliver on our vision and strategy. Also, after the Separation, we became a smaller company, which we believe is well-positioned for focused and strategic growth as we look to the future. At the end of 2018, and after the Separation, we had approximately 10,000 employees and 2018 net sales from continuing operations of $2.97 billion, as compared to the end of 2017 and before the Separation, when we had approximately 18,000 employees and reported 2017 net sales of $4.94 billion. 
With a new, more focused Pentair and with our new mission and vision, we ended 2018 delivering on our commitments to shareholders and exceeding our 2017 performance on critical measures. In 2018 as compared to 2017, we increased our earnings per share from continuing operations ("EPS") by 191.9%, we increased our adjusted EPS by 21.1%, and we increased our segment income by 8.1%. Our net sales grew 4.2% during 2018 compared to 2017, and free cash flow was $410 million for 2018, representing a conversion of 98.5% of our adjusted net income to free cash flow.

   SHAREHOLDER OUTREACH AND SAY ON PAY  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to maintain an open dialogue with our shareholders to gain input on their perspectives regarding our executive compensation program and to provide clarifying information enabling them to make informed decisions in our annual advisory shareholder vote (our "say on pay vote") on the compensation of our executive officers named in our Proxy Statement. 
In 2018, we maintained our shareholder outreach to gain additional insight, better understand shareholder perspectives, and evaluate any concerns regarding our executive compensation program. Additionally, we took the opportunity to discuss the impact of the Separation on our compensation program and treatment of outstanding long term incentive awards. 
The majority of shareholders we spoke with supported our executive compensation program and the changes adopted over the last several years. This support was reflected in the results of the say on pay vote at the 2018 Annual General Meeting, with approximately 93% of votes cast in favor of our proposal. 
Our 2018 shareholder outreach included 35 of our largest shareholders representing 68% of our outstanding shares. Our former Lead Director and former and current Compensation Committee Chairs, along with members of our management team, participated in the majority of the calls with our shareholders. Shareholder feedback and suggestions on our executive compensation program were shared and discussed with the Compensation Committee and the entire Board. Consistent with the strong vote of shareholder approval, and feedback from our shareholders, we did not make any material changes to our compensation program in response to the outcome of the vote. 
Shareholder feedback is an important factor in how we approach and evaluate our executive compensation program. While shareholders have different points of view, the results of our 2018 shareholder discussions were consistent in themes and reinforced the following actions that we had implemented in prior years or updated to better align Pentair's performance metrics and targets as a pure play residential and commercial water treatment company:

   COMPARATIVE FRAMEWORK  
[END TABLE]
In setting compensation for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee uses competitive compensation data from an annual total compensation study of selected peer companies and other relevant survey sources to inform its decisions about overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements. The Compensation Committee uses multiple reference points when establishing targeted compensation levels. The Compensation Committee applies judgment and discretion in establishing targeted pay levels, taking into account not only competitive market data, but also factors such as company, business unit and individual performance, scope of responsibility, critical needs and skill sets, experience, leadership potential, and succession planning. During 2017, in anticipation of the Separation in 2018, the Committee worked with Aon Hewitt to develop an updated group of peer companies that includes companies that would reflect our post-Separation business focus and size. All companies in the peer group were:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Based on Aon Hewitt's recommendations, the Compensation Committee approved an updated group of companies for benchmarking purposes (the "Comparator Group") for use in setting target compensation for 2018 for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers. Our Comparator Group for 2018 included the following 16 peer companies, which had revenues ranging from approximately $1.33 billion to $3.99 billion, with median revenues of approximately $2.68 billion:

For 2018, the principal components of compensation for our Named Executive Officers were: 
The Compensation Committee reviews total compensation for executive officers and the relative levels of each of these forms of compensation against the Compensation Committee's goals to attract, retain and incentivize talented executives and to align the interests of these executives with those of our long-term shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   BASE SALARIES  
[END TABLE]
We provide each Named Executive Officer with a fixed base salary. In setting base salaries, the Compensation Committee generally references comparable positions at peer companies based on available market data, which include published survey data and proxy statement data for our Comparator Group. The Compensation Committee considers compensation at comparable companies but does not set base salaries based on a particular peer group benchmark or any single factor. Differences in base salaries among the Named Executive Officers are determined by the Compensation Committee based on numerous factors such as competitive conditions for the Named Executive Officer's position within the Comparator Group and in the broader employment market, as well as the Named Executive Officer's level of responsibility, experience, and individual performance. 
In December 2017, the Compensation Committee undertook its annual review of base salaries for executive officers and other management personnel, in accordance with its normal procedures. Following a review by Aon Hewitt, the Compensation Committee approved annual increases of 2.0% to 4.5% to salaries for Messrs. Stauch, Borin, and Frykman relative to their then-current positions as of January 1, 2018. The base salaries for Ms. Robertson and Messrs. Hogan and Rolchigo were not adjusted for 2018. 
Additionally, in connection with the Separation, in December 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved base salaries for new Named Executive Officer appointments and other management personnel, effective April 30, 2018. The new appointments included the promotions of Mr. Stauch to President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Borin to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Frykman to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In conjunction with a market review by Aon Hewitt based on the size and industry focus of the new Pentair, the Compensation Committee set the base salaries for Mr. Stauch at $918,000 (representing an increase of 28%), Mr. Borin at $514,000 (representing an increase of 14%), and Mr. Frykman at $646,000 (representing an increase of 28%) for the purposes of aligning their base salaries to their respective new positions effective as of the Separation.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In connection with Ms. Robertson's commencement of employment on December 1, 2017, the Committee set her base salary at $500,000 based on a wide range of factors, including a market review, prior compensation level and arm's length negotiations with Ms. Robertson. Due to her employment with Pentair starting on December 1, 2017, Ms. Robertson's base salary was not changed in 2018. Mr. Rolchigo's appointment as Chief Technology Officer was effective on June 4, 2018, and his base salary remained at $390,000 for 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
To provide competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent while linking pay to annual performance, we pay a portion of our executives' cash compensation as incentive compensation tied to annual business performance as measured against annual goals established by the Compensation Committee. In 2018, we provided cash annual incentive compensation to our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, under our Management Incentive Plan ("MIP") pursuant to the Pentair plc 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee had no discretion to increase formula-derived incentive compensation under the MIP. 
The Compensation Committee determines a percentage of each executive officer's base salary as a targeted level of incentive compensation opportunity under the MIP, based on the Compensation Committee's review of Aon Hewitt's recommendations, relevant survey data and, in the case of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee generally sets each executive officer's target incentive compensation opportunity taking into consideration the Comparator Group's target payouts but does not set target incentive compensation opportunities based on a particular peer group benchmark or any single factor. 
The actual target incentive compensation opportunity set by the Compensation Committee for each executive officer varies depending on a wide range of factors, including competitive conditions for the executive officer's position within the Comparator 
Group and in the broader employment market, as well as the executive officer's performance, level of responsibility, and experience. An executive officer's base salary multiplied by the incentive compensation opportunity percentage establishes the target incentive compensation for which the executive officer is eligible. 
In connection with the Separation, and following a market review by Aon Hewitt based on the size and industry focus of the new Pentair as a stand-alone, pure play water company, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved incentive compensation targets for new officer appointments and other management personnel, effective at the time of the Separation. The Compensation Committee did not change the target annual incentive compensation for Messrs. Hogan or Rolchigo or Ms. Robertson. For Messrs. Stauch, Borin, and Frykman, the Committee increased their target annual incentive compensation from 100% to 120%, 70% to 80%, and 80% to 90% of base salary, respectively, to reflect their increased level of responsibility and competitive conditions in the Comparator Group for their new roles effective as of the Separation. The effective target annual incentive compensation for 2018 and the actual annual incentive compensation paid for 2018 to each of Messrs. Stauch, Borin, and Frykman, reflect a pro rata calculation of the pre- and post-Separation target annual incentive compensation applicable to each of them. 
The Named Executive Officers' incentive compensation targets as a percentage of salary and a dollar amount, based on base salary on December 1, 2018, were as follows:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Mr. Hogan's target incentive compensation reflects his retirement in connection with the Separation and his partial year of service. 
Actual incentive compensation awarded to each Named Executive Officer is capped at 2.5 times the target, depending on actual company performance, as described below. 
For the 2018 MIP, the Compensation Committee approved, based on recommendations of the Chief 
Executive Officer, the following three performance measures, which applied to each of our Named Executive Officers: segment income, revenue, and free cash flow, each measured with respect to company-wide performance. Targets for each measure reflected the new Pentair's company size and long-term goals. The performance goals that applied to each of our Named Executive Officers, as well as the weight assigned to each performance goal and the corresponding payout levels were as follows: 
The Compensation Committee recognized the need to examine performance goals and related targets in the context of Pentair as a stand-alone, pure play water company. As a result, the Compensation Committee made several modifications to the existing program that it felt was appropriate for the new Pentair. First, based on shareholder feedback and the understanding that performance goals needed to be clear and easy to understand for all participants, the Compensation Committee replaced income from growth with revenue growth. Second, the Compensation Committee recognized that without nVent's electrical business, the first few years as a water company would even further emphasize the importance of our focus on income and profitability. Consequently, the Compensation Committee increased the segment income measure from 40% to 50% and reduced the free cash flow measure from 30% to 20%. 
Consistent with our continuous effort to align pay with performance, and to respond to shareholder feedback that compensation should be tied to strategic financial and operating performance goals, the Compensation Committee maintained the change adopted in 2017 under which annual incentive compensation for Named Executive Officers is solely based on the achievement of company-wide financial performance goals. Annual incentives for Named Executive Officers do not have an individual contribution component. Other than the specific changes mentioned above, the general framework of the MIP performance goals remained similar to previous years. 
The target levels for the performance goals were aligned with the corporate objectives in our annual operating plan. To provide an added performance incentive, the Compensation Committee determined that the amount of incentive compensation related to each performance goal would be scaled according to the amount by which the measure exceeded or fell short of the target. The Compensation Committee also determined that the performance goals for free cash flow and revenue should have a threshold level below which no incentive compensation would be earned, and that potential payouts would be scaled from 0.75 at the threshold to 2.0 times at the maximum, as detailed above. For segment income, the Compensation Committee set the threshold at 0.75 and the maximum potential payout at 3.0 times the target. 
The actual incentive compensation of each Named Executive Officer was determined by multiplying the eligible target incentive compensation amount by a multiplier determined as described above. Taking into account the adjustments described below the following table, for 2018, actual results as measured by the performance goals under the MIP for each of our Named Executive Officers were as follows:

Based on the foregoing, the Named Executive Officers received the MIP payouts that are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table." 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed the financial performance measures and payouts for the 2019 MIP and eliminated the 300% payout potential for Segment Income.

   2018 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee emphasizes executive compensation that is tied to building and sustaining our company's value through ordinary share performance over time. 
In keeping with its philosophy that executive compensation must be tied to building and sustaining value through ordinary share performance over time, the Compensation Committee establishes long-term incentive compensation targets taking into consideration both published survey data and data from our Comparator Group. The Compensation Committee does not set award levels based on a particular peer group benchmark or any single factor. The Compensation Committee determines appropriate performance incentives based on a wide range of factors, such as competitive conditions for the Named Executive Officer's position within the Comparator Group and in the broader employment market, as well as the Named Executive Officer's level of responsibility, experience, and individual performance. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded long-term incentive compensation under the Pentair plc 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan. As it does each year, the Compensation Committee referenced benchmark data (including compensation surveys, Comparator Group information and other data provided by Aon Hewitt) in setting target dollar award levels for each Named Executive Officer and for each position or grade level. In connection with the Separation, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved long-term incentive compensation targets with reference to the size and focus areas of the new Pentair as a stand-alone, pure play water company. Due to the Separation, grants for post-Separation Named Executive Officers and other executives were awarded on May 2, 2018 in contrast to our standard practice of awarding long-term incentive compensation in early January. No long-term incentive compensation was awarded to Mr. Hogan for 2018 as a result of his planned retirement. However, in lieu of long-term incentive compensation for 2018, Mr. Hogan received a one-time cash payment for his service from January 2018 through the completion of the Separation. 
As in prior years, the Compensation Committee continued to balance our long-term incentive compensation program components in a manner focused on shareholder wealth creation, the creation of a sustainable business, and ensuring the leadership is committed to the long-term success of our company. For 2018, the Compensation Committee maintained the mix of long-term incentive award of performance share units at 50% of the total long-term award value and stock options and restricted stock units each at 25% of the total long-term award value. The components had the features described below:

Payouts would be scaled for performance between threshold and target levels and between target and superior performance levels. 
The numbers of shares subject to the stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units and the values of the awards granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2018 are reflected under "Executive Compensation Tables — Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018." 
The value of restricted stock units that vested for each Named Executive Officer in 2018 and the value of options exercised by each Named Executive Officer in 2018 are shown in the table under "Executive Compensation Tables — 2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table." 
In December 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the performance goals with respect to our strategy in 2019 and approved the replacement of ROE with ROIC for the 2019-2021 performance period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   PERQUISITES AND OTHER PERSONAL BENEFITS   
[END TABLE]
Effective January 1, 2018, we eliminated our perquisite program ("Flex Perq Program") for all of our executive officers who continued to serve as officers at Pentair after the Separation. 
During 2018, we continued to provide Mr. Hogan, who retired as of the Separation, with the Flex Perq Program under which he received a prorated cash perquisite allowance in an amount consistent with legacy perquisite practices. For 2018, the total aggregate allowance for Mr. Hogan was $25,000. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews market data provided by Aon Hewitt to assess the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to the Named Executive Officers. 
With the elimination of the perquisite program, we provide our executives with limited perquisites in the form of occasional personal use of event tickets when such tickets are not being used for business purposes and a limited financial counseling benefit, for which, in both cases, we have no aggregate incremental cost, as well as one executive physical per year for preventative care.

   TREATMENT OF OUTSTANDING AWARDS AT SEPARATION  
[END TABLE]
The Board and Compensation Committee approved the following treatment of long-term awards not vested and outstanding stock options not exercised in connection with the Separation: 
There was no accelerated vesting for any outstanding long-term awards as a result of the Separation. Additionally, no one-time grants or "Founder's Grants" were awarded in connection with the Separation.

   BUSINESS RESULTS AND TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN   
[END TABLE]
Our net sales from continuing operations during 2018 were $2,965 million, compared to our reported 2017 net sales of $4,937 million as discussed in our Proxy Statement for our 2018 Annual General Meeting, reflecting the results of the Separation on our financial results. Consequently, all of our financial results disclosed in this Proxy Statement reflect only our continuing operations following the Separation. 
The Separation was effected by a pro rata distribution of nVent ordinary shares to holders of Pentair ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Because the value of Pentair ordinary shares prior to the Separation was therefore divided between Pentair ordinary shares and nVent ordinary shares after the Separation, we believe Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance that includes the pre-Separation value of Pentair ordinary shares does not accurately represent our performance as an independent pure play residential and commercial water treatment company. Evaluation of our performance should consider the business results of continuing operations as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. We intend to discuss our TSR performance for post-Separation periods in future proxy statements when comparable information is available.

   STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has established stock ownership guidelines for the Named Executive Officers and other executives to motivate them to become significant shareholders, to further encourage long-term performance and growth, and to align their interests with those of shareholders generally. The Compensation Committee monitors executives' compliance with these guidelines and periodically reviews the definition of "stock ownership" to reflect the practices of companies in the Comparator Group. "Stock ownership" currently includes ordinary shares owned by the officer both directly and indirectly, the pro-rated portion of unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares held in our employee stock ownership plan or our employee stock purchase plan. Stock ownership does not include performance share units until they are earned at the end of the performance period. The Compensation Committee determined that, over a period of five years from appointment, certain executives should accumulate and hold ordinary shares equal to specified multiples of their base salaries. 
Based on the structure of the leadership team following the Separation, the Compensation Committee reviewed the guidelines and increased the requirement for our Chief Operating Officer to 3.0 times base salary as well as the Chief Growth Officer and Chief Technology Officer to 2.5 times base salary in 2018. 
Following those adjustments, the multiples of base salary required by the guidelines are as follows:

Employee benefits such as medical, dental, life insurance and disability coverage are available to all full-time U.S.-based participants through our active employee plans. In addition to these benefits for active employees, we provide post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage to certain retirees in accordance with the legacy company plans that applied at the time the employees were hired. We provide up to one and a half times annual salary (up to $1,000,000) in life insurance, and up to $15,000 per month in long-term disability coverage. The value of these benefits is not required to be included in the Summary Compensation Table because they are made available to all full-time U.S. salaried employees.

[END TABLE]
We sponsor a non-qualified deferred compensation program, called the Sidekick Plan, for our U.S. executives within or above the pay grade that has a midpoint annual salary of $176,900 in 2018. This plan permits executives to defer up to 25% of their base salary and 75% of their annual cash incentive compensation. Executives also may defer receipt of restricted stock units or performance share units. We normally make contributions to the Sidekick Plan on behalf of participants with respect to each participant's contributions from that portion of his or her income above the maximum imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which was $275,000 in 2018, but below the Sidekick Plan's compensation limit of $700,000. Please see the narrative following the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" below for additional information on our contributions. 
Participants in the Sidekick Plan may invest their account balances in a number of possible mutual fund investments. Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Co. provides these investment vehicles for participants and handles all allocation and accounting services for the Sidekick Plan. We do not guarantee or subsidize any investment earnings under the Sidekick Plan, and our ordinary shares are not a permitted investment choice under the Sidekick Plan, although deferred restricted stock units and performance share units are automatically invested in shares. 
Amounts deferred, if any, under the Sidekick Plan by the Named Executive Officers are included in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table."

Upon completion of the Separation and pursuant to a Retirement Agreement that we entered into with Mr. Hogan on March 13, 2018, Mr. Hogan retired as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and joined the board of directors of nVent, serving as non-executive Chairman of nVent's Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee approved such Retirement Agreement after careful consideration of what was in the best interest of our shareholders regarding leadership continuity and the creation of long-term shareholder value. Pursuant to such 
Retirement Agreement, Mr. Hogan is required to, among other things, provide consulting services to us from the date of the Separation through August 31, 2020, for up to 40 hours per calendar year. In exchange, we agreed to, among other things, provide Mr. Hogan with office space and certain support services from the date of the Separation through August 31, 2020, and continue to cover Mr. Hogan and his dependents under our medical and dental plans at our expense through August 31, 2020. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   SEVERANCE AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL BENEFITS   
[END TABLE]
We provide severance and change-in-control benefits to selected executives to provide for continuity of management upon a threatened or completed change in control. These benefits are designed to provide economic protection to key executives following a change in control of our company so that our executives can remain focused on our business without undue personal concern. We believe that the security that these benefits provide helps our key executives to remain focused on our ongoing business and reduces the key executives' concerns about future employment. We also believe that these benefits allow our executives to consider the best interests of our company and shareholders due to the economic security afforded by these benefits. We currently provide the following severance and change-in-control benefits to our executive officers: 
We explain these benefits more fully below under "Executive Compensation Tables — Potential Payments Upon Termination Or Change In Control." 
We have adopted a policy of not including automatic single-trigger change-in-control vesting and excise tax gross-ups in new agreements with our executive officers. In addition, during 2018, all outstanding legacy KEESAs were replaced at the time of the Separation with the new form of KEESA adopted by Pentair for any new hires since 2015. These KEESAs replaced single-trigger vesting of cash and equity awards upon a change in control with double-trigger vesting and also eliminated excise tax gross-ups. Accordingly, none of our KEESAs with our Named Executive Officers include single-trigger vesting or excise tax gross-ups.

   IMPACT OF TAX CONSIDERATIONS   
[END TABLE]
For 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code generally limited to $1,000,000 the amount of compensation that we could deduct in any one year with respect to certain covered employees. 
Starting with the 2018 fiscal year, as a result of the changes made to Section 162(m) of the Code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, our number of covered employees has increased and includes each of our Named Executive Officers. Also starting with the 2018 fiscal year, the only performance-based compensation that will be exempt from the $1,000,000 deduction limit is performance-based compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified after that date. Accordingly, any compensation paid in the future pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into or materially modified after November 2, 
2017, even if performance-based, will count towards the $1,000,000 deduction limit if paid to a covered employee. 
The Compensation Committee also considers the impact of other tax provisions, such as the restrictions on deferred compensation set forth in Section 409A of the Code, and attempts to structure compensation in a tax-efficient manner, both for the Named Executive Officers and for our company. To maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals and as a result of the changes made to Section 162(m) of the Code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, some of the compensation that we provide to our executive officers may not be deductible. It is also possible that compensation we believe to be deductible under Section 162(m) may not be deductible.

   COMPENSATION CONSULTANT   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee engages an external compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee in implementing and overseeing appropriate compensation programs and policies. The Compensation Committee regularly evaluates the performance of its external compensation consultant and periodically conducts a competitive bid process for the role. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to retain Aon Hewitt, an external compensation consultant, to advise the Compensation Committee on executive compensation issues. See "Corporate Governance Matters — Committees of the Board — Compensation Committee." The Compensation Committee evaluated the independence of Aon Hewitt and the individual representatives of Aon Hewitt who served as the Compensation Committee's consultants based on the factors required by the NYSE. Aon Hewitt is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon plc, which provides insurance brokerage and benefit consulting services to us. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid Aon plc approximately $1,944,000 for insurance brokerage and benefit consulting services and Aon Hewitt approximately $222,000 for executive compensation consulting for the Compensation Committee. The decision to engage Aon plc for insurance brokerage and benefit consulting services was made by management and was not approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee concluded, based on the evaluation described above, that the services performed by Aon plc with respect to insurance and benefits administration did not raise a conflict of interest or impair Aon Hewitt's ability to provide independent advice to the Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation matters and that Aon Hewitt was independent for purposes of the Compensation Committee. 
At the direction of the Compensation Committee, Aon Hewitt advises the Compensation Committee in implementing and overseeing appropriate compensation programs and policies. As part of this process, Aon Hewitt provides the Compensation Committee with comparative market data based on analyses of the practices of the Comparator Group defined above under "Comparative Framework" and relevant survey data. The comparative market data that Aon Hewitt provides address the structure of the compensation programs maintained by the Comparator Group companies as well as the amount of compensation they provide. Aon Hewitt provides guidance on industry best practices and advises the Compensation Committee in determining appropriate ranges for base salaries, annual incentives and equity compensation for each senior executive position.

The Chief Executive Officer provides a summary report to the Compensation Committee Chair disclosing the aggregate awards granted by the Chief Executive Officer during the preceding fiscal year. Awards granted to newly hired or promoted executives are effective on the last day of the month following the month in which they were approved. If the last day of such month is a day on which the NYSE is not open for trading, then the grant date will be the first day of the following month on which the NYSE is open for trading. All options are granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value based on the closing share price on the effective day of grant.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
The actual amount of pension benefits ultimately paid to a Named Executive Officer may vary based on a number of factors, including differences from the assumptions used to calculate the amounts. 
The Pentair, Inc. Pension Plan, the Pentair, Inc. Retirement Savings and Stock Incentive Plan, the Pentair, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Pentair, Inc. Restoration Plan were all amended in 2008 to comply with final regulations under Section 409A of the Code. As a result of these amendments, benefits vested prior to January 1, 2005 are separated from benefits earned after January 1, 2005, and may offer different distribution or other options to participants from those described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Pentair, Inc. Pension Plan  
[END TABLE]
The Pentair, Inc. Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan that covers certain of our employees. The Pension Plan is limited to those employees who were hired on or before December 31, 2007, and as such, the only Named Executive Officers eligible to participate in the Pension Plan during 2018 were Messrs. Stauch, Rolchigo, and Hogan. Benefits under the Pension Plan are based upon an employee's years of service and highest average earnings in any five-year period during the ten-year period preceding the employee's retirement (or, in the case of an employee with more than five years but less than ten years of service, during any five-year period preceding the employee's retirement). 
Due to plan termination, no additional benefits may be earned under the Pension Plan after December 31, 2017. Benefits under the Pension Plan are payable after retirement in the form of an annuity. 
During 2018, we offered a limited window, elective lump sum rollover distribution to participants under our qualified pension plan in connection with our de-risking strategy. Messrs. Stauch, Rolchigo and Hogan elected to receive rollover distributions in the amount of $302,496, $426,239 and $972,610, respectively. 
Benefits under the Pension Plan are calculated as an annuity equal to the participant's years of service multiplied by the sum of: 
Years of service under these formulas cannot exceed 35. Contributions to the Pension Plan are made entirely by us and are paid into a trust fund from which the benefits for all participants will be paid. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Pentair, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement and Restoration Plan  
[END TABLE]
The Pentair, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") and the Pentair, Inc. Restoration Plan ("Restoration Plan") are unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. Employees eligible for participation in the SERP include all executive officers and other key executives selected for participation by the Compensation Committee. Participation in the Restoration Plan is limited to eligible employees under the SERP who were eligible employees on or before December 31, 2007. Benefits under these two plans vest upon the completion of five years of benefit service (all service following initial participation). These plans are combined for all administrative, accounting and other purposes. Of the Named Executive Officers, only Messrs. Stauch, Borin, and Hogan participated in the SERP and the Restoration Plan. Mr. Frykman only participated in the SERP. Messrs. Stauch, Borin, Frykman, and Hogan were fully vested in these plans during 2018. 
Benefits under the SERP are based upon an employee's years of service following initial participation and the highest average earnings for a five calendar-year period (ending with retirement). Compensation covered by the SERP and the Restoration Plan for the Named Executive Officers equals the amounts set forth in the "Salary" column under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table" and incentive compensation paid under the MIP set forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive 
54     2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
Plan Compensation" column under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table." 
Benefits under the SERP are calculated as: 
As discussed above, the Pension Plan limits retirement benefits for compensation earned in excess of the annual limitation imposed by the Code, which was $275,000 in 2018. The Restoration Plan is designed to provide retirement benefits based on compensation earned by participants in excess of this annual limitation. 
Benefits under the Restoration Plan are calculated as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Service Age            Percentage 
 Under 25   4.0%  
 25-34   5.5%  
 35-44   7.0%  
 45-54   9.0%  
 55 or over   12.0%  
[END TABLE]
The benefit percentages calculated above are added, and the resulting percentage is multiplied by the covered compensation amount. Benefits vested as of December 31, 2004 are payable after retirement in the form of a 15-year certain annuity or, at the participant's option, a 100% joint and survivor annuity. Benefits earned after December 31, 2004 are payable after retirement in the form of a 15-year certain annuity. No additional benefits may be earned under the Restoration Plan after December 31, 2017. 
The present value of the combined accumulated benefits for the Named Executive Officers under both the SERP and the Restoration Plan is set forth in the table under "Executive Compensation Tables — 2018 Pension Benefits." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Pentair, Inc. Retirement Savings and Stock Incentive Plan  
[END TABLE]
The Pentair, Inc. Retirement Savings and Stock Incentive Plan ("RSIP") is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of base salary and incentive compensation on a before-tax basis and 15% of compensation on an after-tax basis, into their RSIP accounts. Beginning in 2018, we matched an amount equal to one dollar for each dollar contributed to the RSIP by participating employees on the first 5% of their regular earnings on a before-tax basis to incent employees to make contributions to our retirement plan. In addition, in the past, we made discretionary contributions to an employee stock ownership (ESOP) component of the RSIP on behalf of each participant in the RSIP after their first year of employment, but this contribution ceased in 2018 after the 2017 contribution was funded in the first quarter of 2018. The RSIP limits the amount of cash compensation considered for contribution purposes to the maximum imposed by the Code, which was $275,000 in 2018. 
Participants in the RSIP are allowed to invest their account balances in a number of possible mutual fund investments. Our ordinary shares are also a permitted investment choice under the RSIP. 
Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Co. provides these investment vehicles for participants and handles all allocation and accounting services for the Plan. We do not guarantee or subsidize any investment earnings under the RSIP. 
Amounts contributed, if any, under the RSIP by the Named Executive Officers are included in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table." Amounts contributed by us to the RSIP for the Named Executive Officers are included in the "All Other Compensation" column under "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table."

   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE  
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth the contributions, earnings, distributions and 2018 year-end balances for each of the Named Executive Officers under our Sidekick Plan described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Retirement and Other Benefits — Deferred Compensation." Contributions we make to the Sidekick Plan are intended to make up for contributions to our RSIP (including our matching contributions) for cash compensation above the maximum imposed by the Code, which was $275,000 in 2018. Because the Code does not permit contributions on amounts in excess of that limit under a tax-qualified plan, the Sidekick Plan is designed to permit matching contributions on compensation in excess of the maximum imposed by the Code. We make these matching contributions to the Sidekick Plan on amounts in excess of the maximum imposed by the Code, but below the $700,000 compensation limit contained in our Sidekick Plan (such contributions by a Named Executive Officer, "Covered Sidekick Compensation").

We have entered into agreements with certain key corporate executives, including all Named Executive Officers, that provide for contingent benefits upon a change in control. Mr. Hogan's agreement terminated in connection with his retirement at the time of the Separation. These change in control agreements are intended to provide for continuity of management upon a completed or threatened change in control. The agreements provide that covered executive officers could be entitled to certain severance or other benefits following a change in control. If, following such a change in control, the executive officer is involuntarily terminated, other than for disability or for cause, or if such executive officer terminates his or her employment for conditions that constitute good reason, then the executive officer is entitled to certain severance payments. As previously disclosed, we have adopted a policy of not including automatic single trigger change in control vesting and excise tax gross-ups in new agreements with our executive officers.

The amounts in the two tables above assume, to the extent applicable, that: 
The Named Executive Officers' agreements provide that, if excise taxes would otherwise be imposed in connection with a change in control, the executive's change in control compensation protections will be either cut back to a level below the level that would trigger the imposition of the excise taxes or paid in full and subjected to the excise taxes, whichever results in the better after-tax result to the executive. Solely for purposes of the calculations in the tables above, we have assumed that the cut back did not apply. 
Upon Mr. Hogan's retirement from Pentair on April 30, 2018, he was eligible to receive certain benefits pursuant to his Retirement Agreement described above and accelerated or continued vesting of certain equity awards under our 2012 Stock and Incentive Plan. The estimated value of these benefits, determined as of Mr. Hogan's retirement date, were as follows: provision of office space and IT support through August 30, 2020 – $318,622; continuation of medical and dental benefits through August 30, 2020 – $36,944; accelerated vesting of restricted stock units – $8,487,137; and continued vesting of outstanding stock options – $2,550,714. The estimated value of the restricted stock units and stock options were calculated based upon the closing market price of our ordinary shares on April 30, 2018, which was $45.18. A portion of these benefits are disclosed above in the Summary Compensation Table.

   PAY RATIO  
[END TABLE]
As required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018: 
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees is estimated to be 105 to 1. 
Because Mr. Stauch served as our Chief Executive Officer for only a portion of 2018, we annualized his compensation as Chief Executive Officer. For this reason, the annual total compensation disclosed above for purposes of the ratio calculation differs from the total compensation shown for Mr. Stauch in the Summary Compensation Table. To annualize      
Mr. Stauch's compensation, we adjusted his base salary and annual cash incentive award to reflect the adjustments made to his base salary and annual incentive compensation in connection with his promotion, which became effective on April 30, 2018. We did not adjust Mr. Stauch's 2018 long-term incentive awards or his other compensation because no adjustments were made to those awards or other compensation in connection with his promotion. 
To identify our median employee, we began by considering each of the 9,548 individuals employed by us worldwide on October 1, 2018. 
We then calculated the target cash compensation (which we define as base salary or wages plus target cash bonus) for such individuals for 2018 to identify our median employee. To calculate the target cash compensation for any employee that we paid in currency other than U.S. Dollars, we applied the applicable foreign currency exchange rate in effect on October 1, 2018 to convert such foreign employee's target cash compensation into U.S. Dollars. 
Once we identified our median employee, we added together all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in the same way that we calculate the annual total compensation of our Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table.

   RISK CONSIDERATIONS IN COMPENSATION DECISIONS  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that paying for performance is an important part of its compensation philosophy, but recognizes the risk that incentivizing specific measures of performance may pose to the performance of our company as a whole if personnel were to act in ways designed primarily to maximize their compensation. Therefore, the Compensation Committee conducts an annual assessment of potential risks arising from its compensation programs and policies applicable to all employees. In its December 2018 assessment, the Compensation Committee noted the following considerations, among others:

Based on its assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that the risks arising from our executive compensation program and policies are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. The Compensation Committee will continue to assess our executive compensation program to align employee interests with those of long-term shareholder interests.

The Audit and Finance Committee has selected and appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T") to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Board, upon the recommendation of the Audit and Finance Committee, is asking our shareholders to ratify, by nonbinding, advisory vote, the appointment and to authorize, by binding vote, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors to set the independent auditor's remuneration. Although approval is not required by our Articles of Association or otherwise, the Board is submitting the appointment of D&T to our shareholders because we value our shareholders' views on our independent auditor. If the appointment of D&T is not ratified by shareholders, it will be considered as notice to the Board and the Audit and Finance Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee in its discretion may select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. 
The Audit and Finance Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditor retained to audit our financial statements. D&T has been retained as our independent auditor continuously since 1977. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with our retention of D&T. In connection with the mandated rotation of D&T's lead engagement partner, the Audit and Finance Committee and its Chair are directly involved in the selection of D&T's new lead engagement partner. The members of the Audit and Finance Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of D&T to serve as our independent auditor is in our and our shareholders' best interests. 
We expect that one or more representatives of D&T will be present at the Annual General Meeting. Each of these representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires, and is expected to be available to respond to any questions. 
The resolution in respect of this Proposal 3 is an ordinary resolution. The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal 3 is as follows: 
"IT IS RESOLVED, to ratify, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent auditor of Pentair plc and to authorize, in a binding vote, the Audit and Finance Committee to set the auditor's remuneration."

The Audit and Finance Committee pre-approved audit fees and all permitted non-audit services of the independent auditor in 2018. Responsibility for this pre-approval may be delegated to one or more members of the Audit and Finance Committee; all such approvals, however, must be disclosed to the Audit and Finance Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

Table of Contents
Under Irish law, directors of an Irish public listed company must have authority from shareholders to allot (or issue) any shares, including shares that are part of our company's authorized but unissued share capital. When our shareholders approved the adoption of our Articles of Association on May 20, 2014, as permitted by Irish law, the Board was granted authority to issue shares in respect of the whole of the company's authorized share capital for a period of five years. This current authority will expire on May 20, 2019. This authority is fundamental to our business and enables us to issue shares, including, if applicable, in connection with funding acquisitions and raising capital. We are presenting this Proposal 4 to renew the Board's authority to issue our authorized shares on the terms set forth below. 
We understand that it is currently customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to issue up to 33% of a company's issued ordinary share capital and for such authority to be limited to a period of up to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with current customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking approval to authorize the Board to issue up to a maximum of 33% of our issued ordinary share capital as at March 4, 2019 (the latest practicable date before this Proxy Statement), for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, revoked or renewed. 
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish market practice. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital or to approve a specific issuance of shares. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board of Directors the authority to issue shares that are already authorized under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. In addition, we note that, because we are a NYSE-listed company, our shareholders continue to benefit from the protections afforded to them under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and SEC, including those rules that limit our ability to issue shares in specified circumstances. 
The resolution in respect of this Proposal 4 is an ordinary resolution. The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal 4 is as follows: 
"IT IS RESOLVED, that, the Board of Directors be and is generally and unconditionally authorized with effect from the passing of this resolution to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (as defined in Section 1021 of the Companies Act 2014) in an amount up to an aggregate nominal amount of $566,515 (equivalent to 56,651,535 shares), being equivalent to approximately 33% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of March 4, 2019 (the latest practicable date before this Proxy Statement), and the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire eighteen months from the passing of this resolution, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked; provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this authority, which would or might require any such securities to be allotted after this authority has expired, and in that case, the Directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired."

Under Irish law, unless otherwise authorized, certain statutory preemption rights apply automatically in favor of shareholders where shares are to be issued for cash. Under the statutory pre-emption rights, shares issued for cash must be offered to existing shareholders of our company on a pro rata basis before the shares can be issued to any new shareholders. However, when our shareholders approved the adoption of our Articles of Association on May 20, 2014, as permitted by Irish law, our company opted out of these preemption rights in respect of the whole of its authorized share capital for a period of five years. This opt-out will expire on May 20, 2019. The statutory preemption rights do not apply where shares are issued for non-cash consideration (such as in a stock-for-stock acquisition) and do not apply to the issue of non-equity shares (that is, shares that have the right to participate only up to a specified amount in any income or capital distribution) or where shares are issued pursuant to an employee option or similar equity plan. 
We understand that it is currently customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to opt-out of the preemption rights provision in the event of (1) the issuance of shares in connection with any rights issue and (2) the issuance of shares for cash, if the issuance is limited to up to 5% of a company's issued ordinary share capital (with the possibility of issuing up to an additional 5% of the company's issued ordinary share capital provided the company uses it only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issuance, or which has taken place in the preceding 6-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue) bringing the total acceptable limit to 10% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. It is also customary practice for such authority to be limited to a period of 12 to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with current customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking this authority for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, renewed or revoked. 
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish customary practice. Similar to the authorization sought for Proposal 4, this authority is fundamental to our business and, if applicable, will facilitate our ability to fund acquisitions and otherwise raise capital. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board the authority to issue shares in the manner already permitted under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. Without this authorization, in each case where we issue shares for cash, we would first have to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to all of our existing shareholders. This requirement could cause delays in the completion of acquisitions and capital raising for our business. Furthermore, we note that this authorization is required as a matter of Irish law and is not otherwise required for other companies listed on the NYSE. In addition, under Irish law, the Board may only be authorized to opt-out of pre-emption rights if it is authorized to issue shares, which authority is being sought in Proposal 4. 
The resolution in respect of this Proposal 5 is a special resolution. The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal 5 is as follows: 
"IT IS RESOLVED, as a special resolution, that, subject to the passing of the resolution in respect of Proposal 4 as set out above and with effect from the passing of this resolution, the directors be and are hereby empowered pursuant to Section 1023 of the Companies Act 2014 to allot equity securities (as defined in Section 1023 of that Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by Proposal 4 as if sub-section (1) of Section 1022 of that Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this power shall be limited to:

Our historical open-market share repurchases (whether effected as redemptions or otherwise) and other share buyback activities result in ordinary shares being acquired and held by us as treasury shares. We may re-allot treasury shares that we acquire through our various share buyback activities in connection with our employee compensation programs or otherwise. 
Under Irish law, our shareholders must authorize the price range at which we may re-allot any shares held in treasury. In this proposal, that price range is expressed as a minimum and maximum percentage of the prevailing market price (as defined below). Under Irish law, this authorization will expire after eighteen months unless renewed. Accordingly, we expect to propose renewal of this authorization at subsequent Annual General Meetings. 
The authority being sought from shareholders provides that the minimum and maximum prices at which an ordinary share held in treasury may be re-allotted are 95% (or nominal value where the re-allotment of treasury shares is required to satisfy an obligation under any employee or director share or option plan operated by Pentair plc) and 120%, respectively, of the average closing price per ordinary share, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the proposed date of re-allotment. Any re-allotment of treasury shares will be at price levels that the Board considers in the best interests of our shareholders. 
The resolution in respect of this Proposal 6 is a special resolution. The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal 6 is as follows: 
"IT IS RESOLVED, as a special resolution, that for the purposes of Section 1078 of the Companies Act 2014, the re-allotment price range at which any treasury shares (as defined by Section 106 of the Companies Act 2014) for the time being held by Pentair plc may be re-allotted off-market shall be as follows: 
FURTHER RESOLVED, that this authority to re-allot treasury shares shall expire on the date 18 months from the date of the passing of this resolution unless previously varied, revoked or renewed in accordance with the provisions of Sections 109 and/or 1078 (as applicable) of the Companies Act 2014 (and/or any corresponding provision of any amended or replacement legislation) and is without prejudice or limitation to any other authority of the Company to re-allot treasury shares on-market."

   SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE   
[END TABLE]
Our executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and furnish copies of these reports to us. 
We have reviewed copies of reports furnished to us, or written representations that no reports were required. Based solely on these reports, we believe that during 
2018 our executive officers and directors complied with all such filing requirements, except that one report on Form 4 for Mr. Stauch was inadvertently filed late in 2018 to report shares sold by the administrator of Pentair's nonqualified deferral plan to pay taxes applicable to the distribution of shares from such plan due to the plan administrator failing to timely provide the information necessary to report such sale.

   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND VOTING   
[END TABLE]
   Why did I receive these proxy materials?
We are providing these proxy materials to you because our Board of Directors is soliciting proxies for use at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 7, 2019. We either (i) mailed you a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials on or before March 22, 2019 notifying each shareholder entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting how to vote and how to electronically access a copy of this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 or (ii) mailed you a printed copy of such proxy materials and a proxy card in paper format. You received these proxy materials because you were a shareholder of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2019. 
If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, including a proxy card in paper format on which you may submit your vote by mail, you should follow the instructions for requesting such proxy materials in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
This Proxy Statement, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and our Irish statutory financial statements and directors' and auditors' reports are available online at www.proxyvote.com. 
   What is a proxy?
A proxy is your legal designation of another person (the "proxy") to vote on your behalf. By voting your proxy, you are giving the persons named on the proxy card the authority to vote your shares in the manner you indicate on your proxy card. You may vote your proxy by telephone or over the Internet as directed in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if you have requested or received a proxy card, by signing and dating the proxy card and submitting it by mail. 
   What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent, you are a "shareholder of record." If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other custodian or nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other custodian or nominee on how to vote your shares. 
   Who is entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting and how many votes do I have?
The Board has set the close of business on March 4, 2019 (Eastern Standard Time) as the record date for the Annual General Meeting. At the close of business on the record date, we had 171,671,320 ordinary shares outstanding and entitled to vote. All shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote on the matters set forth in this Proxy Statement and any other matter properly presented at the Annual General Meeting. Beneficial owners whose banks, brokers or other custodians or nominees are shareholders registered in our share register with respect to the beneficial owners' shares at the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote on the matters set forth in this Proxy Statement and any other matter properly presented at the Annual General Meeting. Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Annual General Meeting. 
   How do I vote if I am a shareholder of record?
If you are a shareholder of record of ordinary shares, you can vote in the following ways: 
   How do I vote if I am a beneficial owner?
If you are a beneficial owner of ordinary shares, you can vote in the following ways:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND VOTING
   What is the deadline to vote my shares if I do not vote in person at the Annual General Meeting?
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by Internet or by telephone until 8:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) on May 5, 2019. If you are a shareholder of record and submit a proxy card, the proxy card must be received at the address stated on the proxy card by 8:00 a.m. local time (3:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) on May 5, 2019. If you are a beneficial owner, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other custodian or nominee. 
   How do I attend the Annual General Meeting?
All shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date are invited to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. For admission to the Annual General Meeting, shareholders should bring a form of photo identification to the shareholders check-in area at the meeting, where their ownership will be verified. Those who beneficially own shares should also bring account statements or letters from their banks, brokers or other custodians or nominees confirming that they own our ordinary shares as of March 4, 2019 (see above for further information if you also intend to vote at the Annual General Meeting). Registration will begin at 7:00 a.m. (local time) and the Annual General Meeting will begin at 8:00 a.m. (local time) on May 7, 2019. 
Shareholders in Ireland may participate in the Annual General Meeting by audio link at the offices of Arthur Cox, Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380, Ireland at 8:00 a.m. (local time), and the requirements for admission to the Annual General Meeting, as set out above, apply. 
   May I change or revoke my proxy?
If you are a shareholder of record and have already voted, you may change or revoke your proxy before it is exercised at the Annual General Meeting in the following ways: 
If you are a beneficial owner, you must contact the record holder of your shares to revoke a previously authorized proxy or voting instructions. 
   What is the effect of broker non-votes and abstentions?
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular agenda item because the broker does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Although brokers have discretionary power to vote your shares with respect to "routine" matters, they do not have discretionary power to vote your shares on "non-routine" matters pursuant to NYSE rules. If you do not provide voting instructions for proposals considered "non-routine" a "broker non-vote" occurs. We believe that Proposals 1 and 2 will be considered "non-routine" under NYSE rules and therefore your broker will not be able to vote your shares with respect to these proposals unless the broker receives appropriate instructions from you. If a broker does not receive voting instructions from you regarding Proposals 1 and 2, the "broker non-vote" will have no effect on the vote on such agenda items. The "routine" proposals in this Proxy Statement are Proposals 3, 4, 5 and 6, for which your broker has discretionary voting authority under the NYSE rules to vote your shares, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. 
Ordinary shares owned by shareholders electing to abstain from voting on any of the Proposals will have no effect on any of the Proposals. 
   How will my shares be voted if I do not specify how they should be voted?
If you submit a proxy to the company-designated proxy holders and do not provide specific voting instructions, you instruct the company-designated proxy holders to vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND VOTING
If your shares are held in the Pentair Retirement Savings and Stock Incentive Plan or the Pentair, Inc. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan and you either (1) submit a proxy but do not provide specific voting instructions or (2) do not submit a proxy, then your shares will not be voted. 
   How will voting on any other business be conducted?
Other than matters incidental to the conduct of the Annual General Meeting and those set forth in this Proxy Statement, we do not know of any business or proposals to be considered at the Annual General Meeting. If any other business is proposed and properly presented at the Annual General Meeting, you instruct the company-designated proxy holders, in the absence of other specific instructions or the appointment of other proxy holders, to vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. 
   What constitutes a quorum for the Annual General Meeting?
Our Articles of Association provide that all resolutions and elections made at a shareholders' meeting require the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of all shares entitled to vote, with abstentions and broker non-votes regarded as present for purposes of establishing the quorum. 
   Who will count the votes?
Representatives from The Carideo Group, Inc. will count the votes and serve as our Inspectors of Election. 
   Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
We will pay the costs of soliciting proxies sought by the Board. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by our directors, officers or employees telephonically, electronically or by other means of communication. We have engaged Morrow Sodali LLC to assist us in the solicitation of proxies at a cost to us of $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses. We have requested that banks, brokers and other custodians and nominees who hold ordinary shares on behalf of beneficial owners forward soliciting materials to those beneficial owners. Upon request, we will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians and nominees for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding these soliciting materials to beneficial owners of our ordinary shares. 
   Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials?
As explained in more detail below, we are using the "notice and access" system adopted by the SEC relating to the delivery of our proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we mailed to our shareholders of record a notice about the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. Shareholders who received the notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail, e-mail or telephone. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found on the notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how shareholders may request proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail on an ongoing basis. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also serves as a Notice of Meeting. 
   What are the "notice and access" rules and how do they affect the delivery of the proxy materials?
The SEC's notice and access rules allow us to deliver proxy materials to our shareholders by posting the materials on an Internet website, notifying shareholders of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet, and sending paper copies of proxy materials upon shareholder request. We believe that the notice and access rules allow us to use Internet technology that many shareholders prefer, continue to provide our shareholders with the information that they need, and, at the same time, ensure more prompt delivery of the proxy materials. The notice and access rules also lower our cost of printing and delivering the proxy materials and minimize the environmental impact of printing paper copies. 
   Why did I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card?
You may have received multiple Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy cards if you hold your shares in different ways or accounts (for example, 401(k) accounts, joint tenancy, trusts, custodial accounts) or in multiple accounts. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you will receive your voting information from your bank, broker or other custodian or nominee, and you will vote as indicated in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other custodian or nominee. You should vote your proxy for each separate account you have.

   SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS   
[END TABLE]
The deadline for submitting a shareholder proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials for our 2020 Annual General Meeting pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 is November 23, 2019. Any such proposal must meet the requirements set forth in the rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14a-8, for such proposals to be eligible for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and form of proxy for our 2020 Annual General Meeting. 
Eligible shareholders may under certain circumstances be able to nominate and include in our proxy materials a specified number of candidates for election as directors under the proxy access provisions of our Articles of Association. Among other requirements in our Articles of Association, to nominate a director under the proxy access provisions of our Articles of Association, a shareholder must give written notice to our Corporate Secretary that complies with our Articles of Association no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date our definitive Proxy Statement was released to shareholders in connection with the prior year's Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, we must receive notice of a shareholder's nomination for the 2020 Annual General Meeting pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our Articles of Association no earlier than October 24, 2019 and no later than November 23, 2019. If the notice is received outside of that time frame, then the notice will be considered untimely and we are not required to include the nominees in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual General Meeting. 
A shareholder who intends to present business, other than a shareholder proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8, or to nominate a director, other than pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our Articles of Association, at the 2020 Annual General Meeting must comply with the requirements set forth in our Articles of Association. Among other requirements in our Articles of Association, to present business or nominate a director at an Annual General Meeting, a shareholder must give written notice that complies with the Articles of Association to our Corporate Secretary no earlier than 70 days and no later than 45 days prior to the first anniversary of the date our Proxy Statement was released to shareholders in connection with the prior year's Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, we must receive notice of a shareholder's intent to present business, other than pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8, or to nominate a director, other than pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our Articles of Association, no earlier than January 12, 2020 and no later than February 6, 2020. If the notice is received outside of that time frame, then the notice will be considered untimely and we are not required to present such proposal or nomination at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. If the Board chooses to present a matter of business submitted under our Articles of Association at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, then the persons named in the proxies solicited by the Board for the 2020 Annual General Meeting may exercise discretionary voting power with respect to such proposal. 
Shareholder proposals or nominations pursuant to any of the foregoing should be sent to us at our principal executive offices: Pentair plc, Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, London, TW1 3QS, United Kingdom, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
Our Articles of Association can be found on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by searching its EDGAR archives at  https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm. Shareholders may also obtain a copy from us free of charge by submitting a written request to our principal executive offices at Pentair plc, Regal House, 70 London Road, Twickenham, London, TW1 3QS, United Kingdom, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

   IRISH DISCLOSURE OF SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS   
[END TABLE]
Under the Irish Companies Act 2014, our shareholders must notify us if, as a result of a transaction, the shareholder will become interested in 3% or more of our shares, or if as a result of a transaction, a shareholder who was interested in more than 3% of our shares ceases to be so interested. Where a shareholder is interested in more than 3% of our shares, the shareholder must notify us of any alteration of his or her interest that brings his or her total holding through the nearest whole percentage number, whether an increase or a reduction. The relevant percentage figure is calculated by reference to the aggregate nominal value of the shares in which the shareholder is interested as a proportion of the entire nominal value of our issued share capital (or any such class of share capital in issue), and disclosable interests in our shares include any interests in our shares of any kind whatsoever. Where the percentage level of the shareholder's interest does not amount to a whole percentage this figure may be rounded down to the next whole number. We must be notified within five business days of the transaction or alteration of the shareholder's interests that gave rise to the notification requirement. If a shareholder fails to comply with these notification requirements, the shareholder's rights in respect of any our ordinary shares it holds will not be enforceable, either directly or indirectly. However, such person may apply to the court to have the rights attaching to such shares reinstated.
