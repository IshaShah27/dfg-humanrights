The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of the slate of Director nominees and FOR the proposal to amend and restate the Company's 1999 Stock Incentive plan and FOR the proposal to ratify the appointment of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and FOR the approval of the advisory (non-binding) vote on a resolution approving executive compensation as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Please refer to the Proxy Statement for detailed information on the above proposals. Directors and executive officers of Salem will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to questions that our stockholders may have regarding the business to be transacted. 
As we have done in prior years, we are using the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule that permits companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. Unless you have opted out of receiving Notices, instead of mailing you a paper copy of the proxy materials, we will be mailing to you a Notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet. Therefore, a proxy card was not sent to you and you may vote only via telephone or online if you do not attend the Annual Meeting. 
We urge you to vote your proxy as soon as possible. Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we urge you to vote your shares online, by telephone or, if you have chosen to receive paper copies of the proxy materials by mail, by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card promptly in the accompanying postage prepaid envelope. You may, of course, attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person even if you have previously returned your proxy card. The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card and Notice are first being sent or made available to stockholders is March 29, 2019. On behalf of the Board of Directors and all of the employees of Salem, we wish to thank you for your support.

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
For information regarding this proposal, see the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "PROPOSAL 4—AN ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON A RESOLUTION APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ITEM 402 OF REGULATION S-K." 
Shares represented by properly executed proxies received by us will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner specified therein or, if no instructions are marked on the enclosed proxy card, in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement. Although management does not know of any matter other than the proposals described above to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting, unless contrary instructions are given, shares represented by valid proxies will be voted by the persons named on the accompanying proxy card in accordance with their respective best judgment in respect of any other matters that may properly be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Execution of a proxy will not in any way affect a stockholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, and any person giving a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by: (a) filing with the Secretary of Salem either a duly executed written notice dated subsequent the proxy revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or (b) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  The mailing address of the principal executive offices of the Company is 4880 Santa Rosa Road, Camarillo, California 93012, and its telephone number is (805) 987-0400. 
Record Date, Quorum and Voting 
Only stockholders of record on March 13, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. There were outstanding on the Record Date 20,632,416 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A common stock"), and 5,553,696 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B common stock") (the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock are collectively referred to as the "common stock"). Each share of outstanding Class A common stock is entitled to one (1) vote on each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting and each share of outstanding Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10) votes on each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, except that, as provided in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Class A common stock shall be entitled to vote as a class, exclusive of the holders of the Class B common stock, to elect two (2) "Independent Directors." The two (2) Independent Directors shall be elected by a majority of the votes of the shares of Class A common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of the Independent Directors; the remaining seven (7) Directors will be elected by a majority of the votes of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. For information regarding the election of Directors, see the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS." 
The presence in person or representation by proxy of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. If there are not sufficient shares for a quorum at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned in order to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
Only votes cast in person at the Annual Meeting or received by proxy before the beginning of the Annual Meeting will be counted. Giving us your proxy means you authorize the proxy holders to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. If your shares are held in your name, you can vote by proxy in three (3) convenient ways as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      On-Line Voting:    Go to http://www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions 
      By Telephone:    Call toll-free 1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions 
      By Mail:    Complete, sign, date and return your proxy card in the enclosed envelope 
[END TABLE]
Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. on May 7, 2019. 
Under Delaware law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. With regard to Proposal 1, votes may be cast in favor of or against any particular Director nominee. With regard to Proposal 2 and Proposal 3, votes may be cast in favor of or against the proposal. With regard to Proposal 4, votes may be cast in favor of, against or abstaining with respect to the advisory (non-binding) vote on a resolution approving executive compensation as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3, Proposal 4 and any other stockholder proposals that properly come before the Annual Meeting require, in general, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. For Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3, and Proposal 4, abstentions will be counted in tabulations of the votes cast on a proposal and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal, whereas broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved. If you hold shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other   nominee, then you hold shares in street name. Thus, you must instruct the broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. If you do not provide these instructions, the firm that holds your shares will have discretionary authority to vote your shares with respect to "routine" matters. Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3 and Proposal 4 are not considered "routine" matters; thus, your broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares in connection with Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3 or Proposal 4 if you do not provide it with instructions. 
Electronic Access to Proxy Materials 
Pursuant to applicable United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, we are making this Proxy Statement and its Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, available to its stockholders electronically via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. On or about March 29, 2019, we will mail to stockholders a Notice containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement along with our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as instructions on how to vote online. The Notice also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy vote securely over the Internet or by telephone. If you received a Notice, you will not automatically receive a printed copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report. If you would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials as set forth in the Notice. 
Solicitation 
The cost of preparing, assembling and sending the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card will be paid by us. Following the delivery of this Proxy Statement, Directors, Officers and other employees may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile or other electronic means, or by personal interview. These persons will receive no additional compensation for their services. Brokerage houses and other nominees, fiduciaries and custodians nominally holding shares of Class A common stock of record will be requested to forward proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owners of the shares and will be reimbursed by us for their reasonable charges and expenses in connection therewith. 
Householding 
With regard to the delivery of Annual Reports and Proxy Statements, under certain circumstances the SEC permits a single set of these documents or, where applicable, one Notice, to be sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Each stockholder, however, still receives a separate proxy card. This procedure, known as "householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information received at a household and reduces delivery and printing costs as well. A number of banks, brokers and other firms have instituted householding and have previously sent a notice to that effect to certain of our stockholders whose shares are registered in the name of the bank, broker or other firm. As a result, unless the stockholders receiving the notice gave contrary instructions, only one Annual Report and/or Proxy Statement, as applicable, will be delivered to an address at which two (2) or more stockholders reside. If any stockholder residing at the address wishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting or for future stockholder meetings, the stockholder should telephone toll-free 1-800-579-1639, or write to Salem Media Group, Inc., c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. A separate set of proxy materials relating to the Annual Meeting will be sent promptly following receipt of your request. In addition, if any stockholder who previously consented to householding desires to receive a separate copy of a Proxy Statement or Annual Report, as applicable, for each stockholder at his or her same address, the stockholder should contact his or her bank, broker or other firm in whose name the shares are registered or contact us at the address or telephone number listed on page 1 of this Proxy Statement. Similarly, a stockholder may use any of these methods if the stockholder is receiving multiple copies of a Proxy Statement or Annual Report and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors presently consists of nine (9) members (each, a "Director"). On December 12, 2018, Roland S. Hinz, notified us of his immediate desire to retire from the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee. On March 19, 2019, Heather W. Grizzle was appointed to serve the remainder of Mr. Hinz's term and she will stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The following table sets forth certain information as of March 29, 2019, except where otherwise indicated, with respect to our Directors. Each of our Directors serves a one (1) year term and all Directors are subject to re-election at each annual meeting of stockholders.

Board Composition 
As a national media presence with integrated operations including radio broadcasting, digital media, and publishing emphasizing Christian values, family-themed content and conservative news, our business involves an operational structure that operates on a broad scale and encompasses research, technical developments, and marketing functions in a context characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, exposure to business cycles, and significant competition. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and assessing with the Board the appropriate skills, experience, and background sought of Board members in the context of our business and the then-current membership on the Board. This assessment of Board skills, experience, and background includes numerous diverse factors, such as an understanding of and experience in radio and new media, an understanding of our audience and the ministries that serve it, and finance, marketing and advertising experience. The priorities and emphasis of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and of the Board with regard to these factors may change from time to time to take into account changes in our business and other trends, as well as the portfolio of skills and experience of current and prospective Board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board will review and assess the continued relevance of and emphasis on these factors as part of the Board's annual self-assessment process and in connection with candidate searches to determine if they are effective in helping to satisfy the Board's goal of creating and sustaining a Board that can appropriately support and oversee our activities. 
We believe that it is important for our Board members to have diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences and seek this diversity in nominating Director candidates. One goal of this diversity of backgrounds, skills and experience is to assist the Board in its oversight concerning our business and operations. We consider the key skills, qualifications and experience listed below as important for our Directors to collectively have in light of our current business and structure. The Directors' biographies provided later in this Proxy Statement note each   Director's relevant skills, qualifications and experience. As part of an annual effectiveness review, the Board evaluates its composition to ensure that the Board as a whole sufficiently represents a diverse set of relevant backgrounds, skills and experience. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior Executive Leadership Experience. Directors who have served in senior executive leadership positions  are important to us, as they bring experience and perspective in analyzing, shaping, and overseeing the execution of important operational and policy issues at a senior level. The insights and guidance of these Directors, particularly those  Directors who have experience at businesses or organizations that have operated on a global scale, faced significant competition, and/or involved technology or other rapidly evolving business models enhance our Board's ability to assess and  respond to situations faced by the Company.

Our Board of Directors evaluated the independence of each of our Directors pursuant to the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ Rules"). During this review, which included a review of the transactions and relationships described in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS" below, the Board of Directors considered various transactions and relationships among Directors (and their affiliates or family members), members of our senior management, affiliates and subsidiaries of ours and certain other parties that occurred during the past two (2) fiscal years. This review was conducted to determine whether, under the NASDAQ Rules, these relationships or transactions would affect the Board of Directors' determination as to each director's independence. 
Upon conclusion of this review, the Board of Directors determined that, of the Directors nominated for election at the Annual Meeting, a majority of the Board (consisting of Messrs. Riddle, Venverloh, Lewis, Halvorson and Ms. Grizzle) is independent under the NASDAQ Rules. 
The NASDAQ Rules also require that independent members of the Board of Directors meet periodically in executive sessions during which only independent Directors are present. Our independent Directors have met separately in executive sessions and in the future will regularly meet in executive sessions as required by the NASDAQ Rules. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors has three (3) committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The following table identifies the independent members of the Board of Directors and lists the members and chairman of each of these committees:

Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") is a separately designated standing audit committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Halvorson (Chairman), Riddle and Lewis, each of whom is independent under the NASDAQ Rules and applicable SEC rules and regulations. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Halvorson, the Audit Committee Chairperson, qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations. 
The Audit Committee held three (3) regularly scheduled in-person meetings and three (3) telephonic meetings in 2018 and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee   and the Board of Directors annually (or more often as needed) review the charter to ensure it conforms to current laws and practices. This charter is available on our Internet website (http://salemmedia.com) and a copy of the charter may be obtained upon written request from our Secretary. Any information found on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by us. 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities are generally to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary responsibilities relating to our accounting, audit and reporting policies and practices. The Audit Committee also, among other things, oversees our financial reporting process, retains and engages our independent registered public accounting firm, approves the fees for our independent registered public accounting firm, monitors and reviews the quality, activities and functions of our independent registered public accounting firm, and monitors the adequacy of our operating and internal controls and procedures as reported by management and our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee Report set forth later in this Proxy Statement provides additional details about the duties and activities of this committee. 
Compensation Committee 
As provided under applicable laws and rules, our Board of Directors delegates authority for compensation matters to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"). The Compensation Committee's membership is determined by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Riddle (Chairman), and Lewis, each of whom is independent under the NASDAQ Rules, including recently adopted compensation committee independence requirements. The Compensation Committee is authorized to review and approve compensation, including non-cash benefits and severance arrangements for our officers and employees and to approve salaries, remuneration and other forms of additional compensation and benefits as it deems necessary. The Compensation Committee also administers our 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. 
The Compensation Committee held two (2) regularly scheduled meetings and one (1) special meeting in 2018. The Compensation Committee meets at least twice annually and at additional times as are necessary or advisable to fulfill its duties and responsibilities. 
The role of our Compensation Committee is to oversee our compensation and benefit plans and policies, administer our 1999 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (including reviewing and approving equity grants to elected officers), and to review and approve all compensation decisions relating to elected officers, including those for our Named Executive Officers (who are listed in the Summary Compensation Table below). In 2018, the actions of the Compensation Committee included reviewing objective benchmarks and metrics by which a Named Executive Officer's performance can be measured and analyzing peer compensation and performance data for comparison with our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee has delegated limited authority to Edward G. Atsinger III, our Chief Executive Officer, to grant up to $250,000 of equity incentive awards (restricted stock and stock options) to purchase our Class A common stock annually (measured each calendar year without carry-over of unused grant authority from year to year). This delegated authority is subject to prompt notification to the Compensation Committee of the issuance of any such grants and ratification of any such grants at the next regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting following the date of such grants. 
Our Named Executive Officers do not determine or approve any element or component of their own compensation. Our CEO provides a recommendation to the Compensation Committee for base salary and annual incentive compensation for the Named Executive Officers reporting to him. 
The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a charter that was approved by the Board of Directors. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and our Board of Directors annually (or more often as needed) review the charter to ensure it conforms to current laws and practices. This charter is available on our Internet website (http://salemmedia.com) and a copy of the   charter may be obtained from our Secretary upon written request. Any information found on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by us. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee") currently consists of Messrs. Venverloh (Chairman), Riddle, Lewis and Halvorson, each of whom is independent under the NASDAQ Rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held two (2) regularly scheduled meetings and one (1) special meeting in 2018. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is authorized to: (a) develop and recommend a set of corporate governance standards to the Board of Directors for adoption and implementation; (b) identify individuals qualified to become members of the Board of Directors; (c) recommend that director nominees be elected at our next annual meeting of stockholders; (d) recommend nominees to serve on each standing committee of the Board of Directors; (e) lead in the annual review of Board performance and evaluation of the Board's effectiveness; (f) ensure that succession planning takes place for the position of chief executive officer and other key senior management positions; and (g) analyze, review and, where appropriate, approve all related party transactions to which we are a party, all in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. 
To qualify as a nominee for service on the Board of Directors, a candidate must have sufficient time and resources available to successfully carry out the duties required of a Board member. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee desires to attract and retain highly qualified directors who will diligently execute their responsibilities and enhance their knowledge of our core businesses and seeks Directors who possess some or all of the skills, qualifications and experience described under "Board Composition" in this Proxy Statement. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee implements our policy regarding stockholder nominations by considering nominees for director positions that are made by our stockholders. Any stockholder desiring to make such a nomination must submit in writing the name(s) of the recommended nominee(s) to our Secretary at least 90 days prior to, but not earlier than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The written submission must also contain biographical information about the proposed nominee, a description of the nominee's qualifications to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, and evidence of the nominee's valid consent to serve as our director if nominated and duly elected. 
The Board provides oversight of our management and plays a key role in shaping our strategic direction. Consistent with the our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers various criteria in Board candidates, including, the skills, qualifications and experience described under "Board Composition" in this Proxy Statement, as well as their appreciation of our core purpose, core values, and whether they have time available to devote to Board activities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers whether a potential nominee would satisfy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  The criteria for director "independence" established by the NASDAQ Rules; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  The SEC's definition of "audit committee financial expert."  
[END TABLE]
Whenever a vacancy exists on the Board due to expansion of the Board's size or the resignation, retirement or term expiration of an existing director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies and evaluates potential director nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers recommendations of management, stockholders and others. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, including approving its fees and other retention terms.  Director candidates are evaluated using the criteria described above and in light of the then-existing composition of the Board, including its overall size, structure, backgrounds and areas of expertise of existing Directors and the relative mix of independent and employee Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the specific needs of the various Board committees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends potential director nominees to the full Board, and final approval of a candidate for nomination is determined by the full Board. This evaluation process is the same for Director nominees who are recommended by our stockholders. 
The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Board of Directors annually (or more often as needed) review the charter to ensure it conforms to current laws and practices. This charter is available on our Internet website (http://salemmedia.com) and a copy of the charter may be obtained upon written request from our Secretary. Any information found on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report of filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by us. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee did not receive any recommendations from stockholders proposing candidate(s) for election at the Annual Meeting. None of the Directors serving on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are our employees. 
Although the Board does not have a formal policy on diversity, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board review from time-to-time the membership of the Board in light of our operations and strategic objectives and consider whether the current Board members possess the requisite skills, experience and perspectives to oversee the achievement of those goals. As part of an annual effectiveness review, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the diversity of the Board composition to ensure that it sufficiently represents a diverse set of background, skills and experience. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Historically, our Board of Directors has had a general policy that the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO should be held by separate persons as an aid in the Board's oversight of management. This policy has been in effect since we began operations. The Chairman of the Board is a full-time senior executive of ours. The duties of the Chairman of the Board include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding over all meetings of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• preparing the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the CEO and other members of the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• managing the Board's process for annual Director self-assessment and evaluation of the Board and of the CEO;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding over all meetings of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors believes that there are advantages to having a separate Chairman for matters such as communications and relations between the Board members, the CEO, and other senior management; in assisting the Board in reaching consensus on particular strategies and policies; and in facilitating robust Board and CEO evaluation processes. In addition, having separate Chairman and CEO positions permits the CEO to focus on day-to-day business and allows the Chairman to lead the Board in its oversight responsibilities. The Board currently consists of the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, five (5) independent Directors and two (2) non-independent Directors. One of Mr. Epperson's roles is to oversee and manage the Board of Directors and its functions, including setting meeting agendas and running Board meetings. In this regard, Mr. Epperson and the Board in their advisory and oversight roles are particularly focused on assisting the CEO and senior management in seeking and adopting successful business strategies and risk management policies, and in making successful choices in management succession.  Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant Board committees. These committees then provide reports to the full Board. The oversight responsibility of the Board and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks. These areas of focus include strategic, operational, financial and reporting, succession and compensation, legal and compliance, and other risks. The Board and its committees oversee risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility, as summarized above. 
Director Attendance at Board and Committee Meetings and 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
The full Board of Directors held four (4) regularly scheduled meetings in 2018. During 2018, each of our incumbent Directors attended (either in person or telephonically) all of the regularly scheduled meetings of the full Board of Directors. Each of our incumbent Directors attended more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of the number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he served. We encourage, but do not require, that each Director attend our annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, each of our then Directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders 
Communications between Stockholders and the Board 
We have historically handled communications between stockholders and the Board of Directors on an ad hoc basis. We have not adopted a formal policy or process for these communications as of the date of this Proxy Statement. We have, however, taken actions to ensure that the views of our stockholders are communicated to the Board or one or more of the individual Directors, as applicable. The Board considers its responsiveness to such communications as timely and exemplary. 
Financial Code of Conduct 
We have adopted a financial code of conduct ("Financial Code of Conduct") that applies to each Director, the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller and persons performing similar functions. This Financial Code of Conduct has been adopted by the Board as a "code of ethics" that satisfies applicable NASDAQ Rules. The Financial Code of Conduct is available on our Internet website (http://salemmedia.com) and a copy of the Financial Code of Conduct may be obtained free of charge upon written request from the Secretary. Any information found on our website is not a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this or any other report filed with, or furnished to, the SEC by us.

For years in which restricted stock was awarded in settlement of annual performance bonuses, those restricted stock awards are reflected in the year for which the bonus was earned rather than paid.  
(2)  On August 9, 2017, a restricted stock award of 33,066 shares was granted to Edward G. Atsinger III that  vested immediately. The fair value of the restricted stock award was measured based on the grant date market price of our common shares and expensed as of the vesting date. The restricted stock award contained transfer restrictions under which they  could not be sold, pledged, transferred or assigned until ninety (90) days from the vesting date. The recipient of this restricted stock award is entitled to all of the rights of absolute ownership of the restricted stock from the date of  grant, including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends. Restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are granted at no cost to the recipient other than applicable taxes owed by the recipient. The award was considered  issued and outstanding from the vest date of grant.

This Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), nor shall any information in this report be incorporated by reference by any general statement into any past or future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that Salem Media Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation") specifically incorporates this information by reference into such filing, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts. 
The purpose of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is to oversee, on behalf of the entire board of directors (the "Board"): (a) the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Corporation, (b) the audits of the Corporation's financial statements, (c) the qualifications, independence and performance of the public accounting firm engaged as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm to prepare or issue an audit report on the financial statements of the Corporation, and (d) the performance of the Corporation's internal auditor and independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Committee has adopted, and annually reviews, a charter outlining the practices it follows. The charter complies with all current regulatory requirements, including requirements pertaining to the NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards definitions, provisions and applicable exceptions concerning the independence of audit committee members. 
In 2018, the Committee held six meetings, three of which were regularly scheduled in-person meetings and three of which were telephonic. The Committee's meeting agendas are established by the Committee Chairman based upon the Committee's charter and an annual meeting planner approved by the entire Committee. At each of these meetings, the Committee met with the senior members of the Corporation's financial management team and General Counsel. Additionally, the Corporation's internal auditor met with the Committee at the three regularly scheduled in-person meetings and the independent registered public accounting firm met with the Committee at six meetings. Prior to each regularly scheduled meeting, the Chairman of the Committee also met privately with the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm and, separately, with the Corporation's internal auditor, at which times candid discussions of financial management, accounting and internal control issues took place. 
The Committee appointed Crowe LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018, and reviewed with the Corporation's financial managers, the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Corporation's internal auditor, overall audit scopes and plans, the results of internal and external controls and the quality of the Corporation's financial reporting. 
The Corporation's management is primarily responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Corporation's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. As the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, Crowe LLP is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Corporation's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). 
The Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the rules of the PCAOB and the Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence from the Corporation and its management. The Committee has also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Corporation is compatible with the auditor's independence. 
Based on the Committee's reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements referred to above be included in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to be filed with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee is composed of Eric Halvorson, Chairman, Richard Riddle and James Keet Lewis.

Purchase of KTRB(AM) from a Related Party

We had been operating the radio station under an LMA with East Bay Broadcasting, LLC, since June 24, 2016. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the operating results of this station as of the LMA date within the broadcast operating segment. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the transaction, including an appraisal of the station performed by a licensed broker and reports related to the financial performance of the station during the LMA period, and determined that the terms of the transaction were no less favorable to Salem than those that would be available in a comparable transaction in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third-party.

Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
In accordance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures and the requirements of applicable law, all services to be provided by Crowe are pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval includes audit services, audit-related services and other permissible non-audit services. Pre-approval is generally provided by the full Audit Committee for up to a year and is detailed as to the particular defined tasks or scope of work and is subject to a specific budget. In some cases, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee to pre-approve additional services, and any such pre-approvals granted by the Chairman must then be communicated to the full Audit Committee at or prior to the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. When assessing whether it is appropriate to engage the independent registered public accounting firm to perform a service, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, whether these services are consistent with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence and whether these services constitute prohibited non-audit functions under Section 201 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Audit Committee considered the provision of the services listed in the table above by Crowe and determined that the provision of such services was compatible with maintaining the independence of Crowe.

PROPOSAL TO AMEND AND RESTATE 
THE COMPANY'S 1999 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
On May 29, 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in 2001 and further amended and restated in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012, and 2017 (the "Stock Plan"), to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by using investment interests in the Company to attract, retain and motivate its employees and other persons, to encourage and reward their contributions to the performance of the Company and to align their interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors have reviewed the Stock Plan to determine whether it remains a flexible and effective source of incentive compensation in terms of the number of shares of our common stock available for awards and in terms of its design, as well as whether it generally conforms with best practices in today's business environment.

 PROPOSAL 4 
AN ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON A RESOLUTION 
APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED 
PURSUANT TO ITEM 402 OF REGULATION S-K 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company will be asked to vote to approve an advisory (non-binding) resolution approving the executive compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement.

The Company is asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables, is hereby APPROVED. 
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will review and consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program. 
Vote Required and Board of Directors' Recommendation 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting, at which a quorum representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock is present and entitled to vote, is required to approve Proposal 4. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 4.  STOCKHOLDERS' PROPOSALS FOR 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 
Any of our stockholders wishing to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our proxy solicitation materials relating to our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must, in addition to other applicable requirements, give notice of the proposal in writing to the Secretary at its principal executive offices and the notice must be received on or before November 29, 2019. The proposal may be included in next year's proxy statement if it complies with certain rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Proposals must be submitted in accordance with our Bylaws and comply with SEC regulations promulgated pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. 
OTHER MATTERS 
At the time of preparation of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors of the Company was not aware of any other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. No eligible stockholder had submitted notice of any proposal ninety (90) days before the date of the anniversary of last year's annual meeting. However, if any other matters are properly presented for action, in the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy to vote, or refrain from voting, in accordance with their respective best judgment on such matters. 
If a stockholder desires to have a proposal presented at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and the proposal is not intended to be included in our related 2020 proxy solicitation materials, the stockholder must give us advance in accordance with our Bylaws. Pursuant to our Bylaws, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon at an annual meeting of stockholders as are properly brought before the annual meeting. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, in addition to any other applicable requirements, timely notice of the matter must first be given to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's written notice must be delivered to the Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices not later than the 90th day nor earlier than the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, then notice of the stockholder proposal must be delivered to the Secretary not earlier than the 120th day nor later than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. If the proposal is for a nominee for Director, the stockholder's notice must set forth with respect to such Director nominee all of the information relating to that person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for elections of Directors under the rules of the SEC; for any stockholder proposal, the notice must comply with Section 2.2 of Article II of our Bylaws (a copy of which is available upon request to the Secretary), which section requires that the notice contain a brief description of the proposal and the reasons for conducting the business at the annual meeting, the name and address, as they appear on our books, of the stockholder making the proposal, the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock beneficially owned by the stockholder and any material interest of the stockholder in such proposal. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and applicable requirements of NASDAQ, officers and Directors of the Company and persons who beneficially own more ten percent (10%) of our common stock are required to: (a) report their initial ownership and change in ownership with respect to all equity securities of the Company; and (b) furnish those reports to the Company. 
Based solely on its review of the copies of such reports received by it during or with respect to the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that our officers, Directors and more than ten (10) percent stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to those individuals.  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K 
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 including audited financial statements, is being made available to stockholders along with these proxy materials, but this Annual Report is not incorporated herein and is not deemed to be a part of this Proxy Statement. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC is available to stockholders via our website (http://salemmedia.com) or in printed form (without exhibits) without charge on written request to us.
