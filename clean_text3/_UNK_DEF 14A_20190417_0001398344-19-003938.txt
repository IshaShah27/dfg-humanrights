The expenses incurred in connection with preparing the Proxy Statement and its enclosures will be paid by the Funds. The Funds will also reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the Funds' Shares (as defined below).

Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and voting his or her shares in person or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later-dated proxy to a Fund at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting.  
The holders of one third of the Shares entitled to vote on any matter at the Meeting present in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at the Meeting for purposes of conducting business. If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting, but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposed items are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. A shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received for approval and it is otherwise appropriate. Any such adjournment will require approval of the Chairman, the Trustees or the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present at the Meeting in person or by proxy. If a quorum is present, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that they are entitled to vote "FOR" any proposal in favor of such adjournment and will vote those proxies required to be voted "AGAINST" any proposal against such adjournment.

Trustee Transactions with Fund Affiliates 
As of December 31, 2018, none of the independent trustees, meaning those Trustees who are not "interested persons" as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and are independent under the New York Stock Exchange's ("NYSE") Listing Standards (each an "Independent Trustee" and collectively the "Independent Trustees"), nor members of their immediate families owned securities, beneficially or of record, in GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC (the "Adviser"), or an affiliate or person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser, other than investments in the Funds and investments in affiliated investment vehicles that, pursuant to guidance from the SEC Staff, do not affect such Trustee's independence.

Each Trustee then serving in such capacity attended at least 75% of the meetings of Trustees and of any Committee of which he is a member. 
Leadership Structure of the Board of Trustees 
Each Board of Trustees is currently comprised of five Trustees. Daniel H. Smith, Jr. serves as Chairman of each Board. Mr. Smith is an "interested person" of the Funds. The appointment of Mr. Smith as Chairman reflects each Board of Trustees' belief that his experience, familiarity with the relevant Fund's day-to-day operations and access to individuals with responsibility for the relevant Fund's management and operations provides each Board of Trustees with insight into the relevant Fund's business and activities and, with his access to appropriate administrative support, facilitates the efficient development of meeting agendas that address the relevant Fund's business, legal and other needs and the orderly conduct of board meetings. Each Board of Trustees has appointed Mr. D'Alelio as Lead Independent Trustee to ensure that the Independent Trustees have adequate control and influence over the governance of the Board of Trustees. In addition, all committees are chaired by Independent Trustees. Each Board of Trustees has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate in light of the relevant Fund's circumstances and provides for the informed and independent exercise of its responsibilities. 
Oversight of Risk Management 
Each Board of Trustees' role in risk oversight of the Funds reflects its responsibility under applicable state law to oversee generally, rather than to manage, the operations of the relevant Fund. In line with its oversight responsibility, the Board of Trustees receives reports and makes inquiries at its regular meetings and as needed regarding the nature and extent of significant Fund risks (including investment, compliance and valuation risks) that potentially could have a materially adverse impact on the business operations, investment performance or reputation of the relevant Fund, but relies upon the Fund's management (including the Funds' portfolio managers) and Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Board of Trustees, and the Adviser to assist it in identifying and understanding the nature and extent of such risks and determining whether, and to what extent, such risks may be eliminated or mitigated. In addition to reports and other information received from Fund management and the Adviser regarding each Fund's investment program and activities, the Board of Trustees as part of its risk oversight efforts expects to meet at its regular meetings and as needed with the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer to discuss, among other things, risk issues and issues regarding the policies, procedures and controls of each Fund. The Board of Trustees may be assisted in performing aspects of its role in risk oversight by the Audit Committee and such other standing or special committees as may be established from time to time by the Board of Trustees. For example, the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees will meet regularly with the Funds' independent public accounting firm to review, among other things, reports on the Funds' internal controls for financial reporting. 
Each Board of Trustees believes that not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Funds' goals, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Trustees as to risk management matters may be summaries of relevant information and may be inaccurate or incomplete. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board of Trustees' risk management oversight is expected to be subject to substantial limitations. 
Audit Committee Reports 
The Audit Committee acts according to the Audit Committee charter (the "Charter"). Thomas W. Jasper has been appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee of each Fund's Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Trustees of the Funds in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to accounting and financial reporting policies and practices of each Fund, including, but not limited to, the adequacy of each Fund's accounting and financial reporting processes, policies and practices; the integrity of each Fund's financial statements; the adequacy of each Fund's overall system of internal controls; each Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the qualification and independence of each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm; the performance of each Fund's internal audit function provided by the Adviser and each Fund's other service providers; and the review of the report required to be included in the Funds' annual proxy statement by the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee is also required to prepare an audit committee report to be included in the Funds' annual proxy statement as required by Item 407(d)(3)(i) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to the Charter that was most recently reviewed by each Fund's Board of Trustees on November 15, 2018. The Charter is available on the Funds' website, www.blackstone-gso.com. As set forth in the Charter, the function of the Committee is oversight; it is the responsibility of the Adviser to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the independent auditors' responsibility to plan and carry out a proper audit. The independent accountant is ultimately accountable to each Fund's Board of Trustees and Audit Committee, as representatives of each Fund's shareholders. The independent accountant for the Funds reports directly to the Audit Committee. 
In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on February 19, 2019, each Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management of each Fund and the independent accountant, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), the audited financial statements of each Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and discussed the audit of such financial statements with the independent accountant. 
In addition, each Audit Committee discussed with the independent accountant the accounting principles applied by each Fund and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by the independent accountant required by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 114, (The Auditor's communication with those charged with Governance) as currently modified or supplemented and No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee also received from the independent accountant the written disclosures and letters required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3526 and discussed the relationship between the independent accountant and each Fund and the impact that any such relationships might have on the objectivity and independence of the independent accountant. 
The members of each Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, each Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Funds' independent accountant. Accordingly, each Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, each Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of each Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the Funds' independent accountant, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Charter and those discussed above, each Audit Committee recommends to the Funds' Board of Trustees that each Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Funds' Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
SUBMITTED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF EACH FUND'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
Thomas W. Jasper, Audit Committee Chairman  Edward H. D'Alelio  Michael F. Holland  Gary S. Schpero 
February 19, 2019 
Each Fund's Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Each Fund's Audit Committee is composed of four Independent Trustees, namely Messrs. D'Alelio, Jasper, Holland and Schpero. None of the members of each of the Audit Committees is an "interested person" of the Fund. 
Based on the findings of each Audit Committee, each Board of Trustees has determined that Thomas W. Jasper is each Fund's "audit committee financial expert," as defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, and as required by NYSE Listing Standards. Thomas W. Jasper serves as the Chairman of each Audit Committee. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
Each Fund's Board of Trustees has a Nominating and Governance Committee that is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates for election as Trustees to the Board of Trustees of the Fund. The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are Edward H. D'Alelio, Michael F. Holland, Thomas W. Jasper and Gary S. Schpero, all of whom have been determined not to be "interested persons" of the Fund under the 1940 Act and who are "independent" as defined in the NYSE listing standards. Mr. Schpero serves as Chairman of each Nominating and Governance Committee. Each Fund's Nominating and Governance Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
When vacancies or creations occur, each Nominating and Governance Committee will consider Trustee candidates recommended by a variety of sources to nominate for election by each Fund's shareholders. Each Nominating and Governance Committee may accept nominees recommended by a shareholder as it deems appropriate. Shareholders who wish to recommend a nominee for a Fund's Board of Trustees should send recommendations to the relevant Fund's Secretary that include all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of Trustees. A recommendation must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board of Trustees and to serve if elected by the shareholders. In considering Trustee candidates, each Nominating and Governance Committee will take into consideration the interest of shareholders, the needs of the Board of Trustees and the Trustee candidate's qualifications, which include but are not limited to, the quality and diversity of the individual's professional experience, education, individual qualification or skills. 
Any shareholder recommendation described above must be sent to the relevant Fund's Secretary at 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, New York 10154. Each Fund's Nominating and Governance Committee charter is available on the Funds' website (www.blackstone-gso.com). 
Valuation Committee 
None of the Funds has a Valuation Committee. Each Board of Trustees has delegated day-to-day responsibility for implementing the valuation process pursuant to policies and procedures approved by each Board of Trustees to the Adviser (including a committee of the Adviser that values fair valued assets) and ALPS. 
Compensation Committee 
None of the Funds has a Compensation Committee, however the Nominating and Governance Committee also reviews compensation arrangements for the Independent Trustees and submits its recommendations to the Board of Trustees. 
Other Board Related Matters 
The Funds do not require Trustees to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
