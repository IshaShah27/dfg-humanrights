[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are reviewed at least annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which considers whether to recommend any changes to the Board. Each Board committee reviews its charter at least annually. 
The company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Board committee charters are available on the company's website, www.americanhomes4rent.com under the tab "For Investors." A copy of each may be obtained by sending a written request to the company's Investor Relations Department, American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301, or submitting an information request under the tab "For Investors" on the company's website. Any amendments or waivers to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for trustees or executive officers may be made only by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board and will be disclosed on the company's website or other appropriate means in accordance with applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") requirements. 
Board Leadership 
We have separate individuals serving as Chairman of the Board and as Chief Executive Officer. B. Wayne Hughes serves as our Non-Executive Chairman. David P. Singelyn serves as Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the day-to-day management and profitable growth of the company. 
Although the positions are currently held by separate individuals, the company does not have a policy against one individual holding the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rather, the Board evaluates the desirability of having combined or separate roles for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from time-to-time and adopts a structure based on what it believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Currently, the Board believes that having a separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer serves the interests of the company and its shareholders well. 
The Board has also established a position of independent presiding trustee, to provide for an independent leadership role on the Board. The independent presiding trustee, who must be one of the independent trustees, presides at meetings of all non-management trustees in executive session without the presence of management. These meetings are held on a regular basis, generally before or after each regularly scheduled Board meeting and at the request of any non-management trustee. In addition, the independent trustees meet separately at least once annually. These sessions are designed to encourage open Board discussion of any matter of interest without our chief executive officer or any other members of management present. 
The independent presiding trustee of these sessions is appointed by the independent trustees annually for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting. Matthew J. Hart has been appointed as the independent presiding trustee for meetings of the non-management trustees until the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Board Responsibilities and Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the company's approach to major risks and our policies for assessing and managing these risks. As part of its oversight function, the Board regularly receives presentations from management on areas of risk facing our business. The Board and management actively engage in discussions about these potential and perceived risks to the business. 
In addition, the Board is assisted in its oversight responsibilities by the standing Board committees, which have assigned areas of oversight responsibility for various matters as described in the Board committee charters and as provided in the NYSE rules. For example, the Audit Committee assists with the Board's oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm and the performance of our internal audit function. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee also considers our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews various potential areas of financial risk in detail on a regular basis. The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers and evaluates the appropriate compensation incentives to motivate senior management to grow long-term shareholder returns without undue risk taking. 
The Board committees also hear reports from the members of management to enable each committee to understand and discuss risk identification and risk management. The chair of each of the Board's standing committees reports on the discussion to the full Board at the next Board meeting. All trustees have access to members of management in the event a trustee wishes to follow up on items discussed outside the Board meeting. 
Trustee Independence 
The Board evaluates the independence of each trustee annually based on information supplied by trustees and the company and on the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
 Committee. The company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of the trustees be independent in accordance with the requirements of the rules of the NYSE and our Board continues to comply with that requirement. Our non-management and independent trustees meet regularly in executive sessions without members of management present, generally following each regularly scheduled Board meeting. 
No trustee qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the trustee has no material relationship with the company and its management, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, in accordance with NYSE rules. Material relationships may include commercial, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, family and other business, professional and personal relationships. 
Following its annual review of each trustee's independence in February 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board and the Board determined that (1) each member of the Board, other than B. Wayne Hughes, Tamara Hughes Gustavson, David P. Singelyn and John Corrigan, and (2) each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent pursuant to the rules of the NYSE. 
In addition, the Board has determined that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each member of the Audit Committee meets the additional independence requirements set forth in Section 10A(m)(3) of  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) and the SEC's rules thereunder; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each member of the Compensation Committee meets the NYSE's heightened independence requirements for compensation  committee members.  
[END TABLE]
Committees of the Board 
Our Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of these committees consists of at least three members, each of whom meets the independence standards of the NYSE. Matters put to a vote by any one of our three independent committees of our Board must be approved by a majority of the trustees on the committee who are present at a meeting, in person or as otherwise permitted by our bylaws, at which there is a quorum or by the unanimous written consent of the trustees serving on the committee. Additionally, our Board may from time to time establish other committees to facilitate the Board's oversight of management of the business and affairs of the company. 
Each of the standing committees operates pursuant to a written charter which is reviewed and reassessed annually and that can be viewed on our website at www.americanhomes4rent.com under the tab "For Investors." A print copy will be provided to any shareholder who requests a copy by writing to the company's Secretary at American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301, or submitting an information request under the tab "For Investors" on the company's website. 
Our three standing committees are described below, and the current committee members and number of meetings held in 2018 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Audit Committee. Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of the Audit Committee members meets the definition of "independent trustee" for purposes of the NYSE rules and the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Our Board has also determined that each member of our Audit Committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under SEC rules and regulations. The Audit Committee's principal functions consist of overseeing:

[END TABLE]
During 2018, the Compensation Committee made all compensation decisions for our executive officers, including the named executive officers, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. None of our current Compensation Committee members is or was an officer or employee, or former officer or employee, of the company. None of our executive officers serve as a member of a board of directors, board of trustees or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any other entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee. 
Oversight of Compensation Risks. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee considered a report from management concerning its review of potential risks related to compensation policies and practices of all employees of the company. During its review, the Compensation Committee discussed the report with senior management and discussed management's conclusion that the company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. 
To prepare the report for the Compensation Committee's consideration, members of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Senior Vice President of Administration and our Vice President of Human Resources, reviewed each of the company's executive compensation programs, focusing on employee incentive compensation plans. At the completion of the review, management and the Compensation Committee concluded that there is little motivation or opportunity for employees to take undue risks to earn incentive compensation awards and that the incentive compensation plans properly incentivize employees to achieve long-term goals and do not create undue risks for the company. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's principal functions consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying, evaluating and recommending to the Board the trustee nominees for each annual shareholder meeting or to fill  any vacancy on the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board and ensuring that our Board has the requisite expertise;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the annual self-evaluations of the Board and management; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing our Board's compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  
[END TABLE]
Board Orientation and Education 
Each new trustee participates in an orientation program and receives materials and briefings concerning our business, industry, management and corporate governance policies and practices. We provide continuing education for all trustees through board materials and presentations, discussions with management and the opportunity to attend external board education programs. In addition, all Board members have the opportunity to become a member of the National Association of Corporate Directors and access the many educational resources of that organization. 
Trustee Compensation 
Our Board has established a compensation program for our non-management trustees that includes a mix of cash and equity compensation. The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the adequacy of the trustee compensation program. 
Retainers. During 2018, pursuant to this compensation program, we paid the following cash compensation to each of our independent trustees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual cash retainer of $75,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 to the chair of our Audit Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an additional annual cash retainer of $7,500 to the chair of our Compensation Committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an additional annual cash retainer of $7,500 to the chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.   
[END TABLE]
For 2019, the cash compensation was revised to increase the annual cash retainer for the chair of the Audit Committee to $15,000 and to pay the presiding independent trustee, who previously served without compensation, an annual cash retainer of $15,000. 
We also reimburse our independent trustees for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of their duties as trustees, including without limitation, travel expenses in connection with their attendance in-person at Board and committee meetings. Trustees who are employees do not receive any compensation for their services as trustees. 
Equity Awards. During 2018, each non-management trustee received an annual share option grant to acquire 10,000 Class A common shares and new non-management trustees received an initial option grant to acquire 10,000 Class A common shares with a grant price set at the closing price on the NYSE of the company's Class A common shares on the date of grant. The option vests in four equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant. 
For 2019, the annual share option grant will be replaced with an annual award on the date of the Annual Meeting of restricted shares units with a value of $75,000 as determined based on the closing price on the NYSE of the company's Class A common shares on the date of grant. New trustees continue to receive an initial share option grant to acquire 10,000 Class A common shares that vests in four equal annual installments.

[END TABLE]
Board and Committee Meetings and Attendance 
The Board meets at regularly scheduled intervals and may hold additional special meetings as necessary or desirable in furtherance of its oversight responsibilities. As described above, the non-management trustees generally meet in executive session without the presence of management as part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The sessions are intended to encourage open discussion of any matter of interest without the Chief Executive Officer or any member of management present. 
During 2018, the Board held eight meetings and the Board committees held eleven meetings. During 2018, all trustees attended at least 75% of the meetings held by the Board and all committees of the Board on which each trustee served. Seven of the company's then nine trustees attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. Trustees are encouraged, but not required, to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Trustee Retirement Policy 
To encourage refreshment of the Board, the Board has adopted a mandatory retirement age for trustees of 75, excluding the company's founder, B. Wayne Hughes. The policy provides in relevant part that, effective with the 2019 Annual Meeting, no trustee, other than Mr. Hughes, will be nominated for election to the Board unless he or she will be 75 or younger on the first day of such Board term. 
Consideration of Candidates for Trustee 
Shareholder recommendations. The policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider properly submitted shareholder recommendations for candidates for membership on the Board is described below under "Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Trustees." Under this policy, shareholder recommendations may only be submitted by a shareholder entitled to submit shareholder proposals under the SEC rules. Any shareholder recommendations proposed for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should include the nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership, including the information required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, and should be addressed to the Secretary at American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301. Recommendations for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting should be submitted within the time frame described in this proxy statement under "Deadlines for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals." 
Trustee Qualifications. Members of the Board should have the highest personal and professional integrity, shall have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and shall be most effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in serving the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders. In general, the Board seeks to add trustees who meet the independence requirements of the NYSE rules. In addition, trustee candidates must submit a completed trustee questionnaire concerning matters related to independence determination, the determination of whether a candidate qualifies as an audit committee financial expert and other proxy disclosure matters and must satisfactorily complete a background investigation by a third-party firm. 
The Board has delegated to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee responsibility for recommending to the Board new trustees for election and assessing the skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the current make-up of the Board. This assessment includes trustees' qualifications as independent, and may include consideration of the following, all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at that time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• diversity, background, skills and experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business community;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• knowledge and contacts in the communities in which the company conducts business and in the company's industry or  other industries relevant to the company's business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability and willingness to devote sufficient time to serve on the Board and committees of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• knowledge and expertise in various areas deemed appropriate by the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• how the individual's skills, experience and personality fit with those of other trustees in maintaining an effective,  collegial and responsive Board.  
[END TABLE]
There are no other policies or guidelines that limit the selection of trustee candidates by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board have and exercise broad discretion to select trustee candidates who will best serve the Board, the company and its shareholders. 
Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Trustee. The company was formed, and seven of the eleven current Board members were first elected, in 2012. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. In the event that vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider various potential candidates for trustee. 
Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, shareholders or other persons. These candidates will be evaluated at meetings of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and may be considered at any point during the year. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider properly submitted shareholder nominations of candidates for the Board in the same manner as other candidates. Following verification of the shareholder status of persons proposing candidates, recommendations will be aggregated and considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to the issuance of the proxy statement for the annual meeting. If any materials are provided by a shareholder in connection with the recommendation of a trustee candidate, such materials are forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also review materials provided by professional search firms or other parties in connection with a nominee who is not proposed by a shareholder. In evaluating such nominations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board. 
As discussed above in Trustee Succession Planning, in connection with the identification and evaluation of the trustees elected in 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed various individual candidates proposed by various Board members and investment bankers. The Committee narrowed the list and interviewed several candidates and encouraged Board members to interview candidates. The nominee selection process involved extensive interviews and a portion or all of six formal meetings of the full Nominating and Governance Committee. At the conclusion of the interview process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considered feedback from the interviews, discussed the proposed candidates and recommended that the Board elect Ms. Webb and Mr. Willoughby as trustees. Each was unanimously elected a trustee by the Board. 
Communications with the Board 
The company provides a process by which shareholders and interested parties may communicate with the Board. Any shareholder communication to the Board should be addressed to: Board of Trustees, c/o Corporate Secretary, American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301. Communications that are intended for a specified individual trustee or group of trustees should be addressed to the trustee(s) c/o Corporate Secretary at the above address, and all such communications received will be forwarded to the designated trustee(s). 
PROPOSAL 2 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing the company's independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young, LLP ("EY") was first appointed as the company's independent registered public accounting firm in August 2016. In February 2019, the Audit Committee re-appointed EY to serve as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, subject to ratification of the appointment by the company's shareholders. The Board believes that the selection of EY is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and recommends that shareholders ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of EY as the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Although we are not required to seek ratification of the appointment of EY, the Board believes that doing so is a matter of good corporate governance. Even if the appointment of EY is ratified by the shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection but may determine to confirm the appointment. 
Representatives from EY will be in attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
The following table shows the fees billed to the company by EY for audit and other services provided for fiscal years 2018 and 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit fees (1)    $ 1,581,559      $ 1,710,746   
 Audit-related fees  (2)    $  1,995      $  100,400

 Total    $ 1,583,554      $ 1,811,146   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of the company's annual  financial statements, review of the quarterly financial statements included in the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other professional services in connection with the company's  registration statements, securities offerings and audits of financial statements of certain acquired assets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Audit-related fees represent fees for professional services primarily provided in  connection with agreed-upon procedures related to the company's subsidiary's securitization transactions and access to online accounting services in 2017 and solely for online accounting services in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Auditor Independence. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the non-audit services described above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Policy to Approve Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy relating to services performed by the company's independent registered public accounting firm. Pursuant to the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy all audit and permissible non-audit services must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to its Chairman to specifically pre-approve engagements for the performance of audit and permissible non-audit services, for which the estimated cost for all such services shall not exceed $200,000 prior to reporting such pre-approved engagements to the Audit Committee. The Chairman must report all pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting for review and provide a description of the terms of the engagement, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the type of services covered by the engagement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the dates the engagement is scheduled to commence and terminate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the estimated fees payable by us pursuant to the engagement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other material terms of the engagement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such other information as the Audit Committee may request.  
[END TABLE]
Under this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by EY during 2018, including those listed in the previous table. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee's responsibilities include appointing the company's independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approving audit and non-audit services provided by the firm and assisting the Board in providing oversight to the company's financial reporting process. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with the company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. 
Management is responsible for the company's financial statements, including the estimates and judgments on which they are based, for maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and for issuing a report thereon. It is not the Audit Committee's responsibility to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the company's financial statements and disclosures are complete, accurate and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and the Audit Committee necessarily relies on the work and assurances of the company's management and of the company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
As part of its oversight responsibilities related to the company's financial statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee met with management and Ernst & Young, LLP ("EY"), the company's independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewed and discussed with them the audited consolidated financial statements. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee discussed with EY firm matters required to be discussed under applicable standards of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee also discussed with EY the overall scope and plans for the annual audit, the results of their examinations, their evaluation of the company's internal controls and the overall quality of the company's financial reporting. 
The company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable rules of the PCAOB, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the company and its affiliates is compatible with the firm's independence. 
The Audit Committee met with representatives of management, internal audit, legal counsel and the company's independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss the progress of management's testing and evaluation of the company's system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations. At the conclusion of this process, the Audit Committee received from management its assessment and report on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OWNERSHIPOF COMPANY SHARES 
CEO Share Ownership Policy 
Our share ownership guidelines approved by the Board provide that the chief executive officer will own Class A common shares with a value of three times the chief executive officer's annual base salary within four years after his or her initial election to the position. Unvested restricted shares, if any, and Class A partnership units that can convert to Class A commons shares are included in the calculation but vested and unvested stock options are excluded. We believe this policy further enhances the alignment of the interests of the company's chief executive officer and shareowners. Mr. Singelyn's beneficial ownership of 471,170 Class A common shares and 2,640,000 Class A partnership units substantially exceeds the share ownership guidelines. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
The anti-hedging provisions of our insider trading policy prohibits trustees, officers and employees from directly or indirectly engaging in hedging against future declines in the market value of any securities of the company. Waivers of these prohibitions are not permitted under the policy. The objective of this policy is to further enhance alignment between the interests of our trustees, officers and employees and those of our shareholders. 
Policy Regarding Pledging of Shares 
Our securities trading policy discourages, but does not prohibit, the pledging of shares of company common stock by insiders. In approving the policy, the Board considered that David P. Singelyn, John Corrigan and David Goldberg previously received loans from an affiliate of Ms. Gustavson in connection with their acquisition of interests in the company's former sponsor, AH LLC and that these loans were secured by pledges of their membership interests in AH LLC. When AH LLC was liquidated and its Class A common shares and partnership units of the company were distributed pro rata to its members, Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg agreed to transfer the pledge from their interests in AH LLC to the common shares and operating partnership units of the company they received in the liquidation. The loans are currently held by Ms. Gustavson and the shares and operating partnership units formerly pledged to her affiliate are now pledged to her, except that Mr. Singelyn refinanced a portion of his loan from Ms. Gustavson with a bank and pledged shares to secure that loan. 
Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg are required to repay the loans to Ms. Gustavson on or before December 31, 2019. In connection with the loan repayments, the company has registered the resale of all the shares and operating partnership units pledged to Ms. Gustavson. Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg expect to sell some of these shares and convert operating partnership units to shares for sale to repay some or all of the loan amounts together with taxes payable on the disposition. In addition, they may refinance some or all of the outstanding loans with borrowings from third party lenders who may also require pledges of shares and operating partnership units to secure repayment. 
Our Board views the current arrangements as unlikely to result in adverse effects to shareholders because our largest individual shareholder is the principal creditor. Our Board also recognizes that maintaining these pledges facilitates liquidity and financial flexibility for Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the company's trustees and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of the company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership of those securities with the SEC and the NYSE. Executive officers, trustees and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to provide the company with a copy of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. Based on a review of the reports submitted to the company and of filings on the SEC's EDGAR website and of written representations from executive officers and trustees, the company believes that all trustees and officers filed timely reports during 2018. 
Executive Officers 
Set forth below is certain information regarding each of our current executive officers, other than Messrs. Singelyn and Corrigan, whose biographical information is presented under "Biographical Information about our Trustee Nominees."

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the compensation for our principal executive officer and principal financial officer during 2018, our principal operating officer and the three next most highly compensated persons who were executive officers of the company on December 31, 2018 and whom we refer to as our "named executive officers." The Compensation Discussion and Analysis explains the objectives of our executive compensation programs, outlines the elements of executive officer compensation and describes the factors considered by the Compensation Committee to determine the amounts of compensation for our named executive officers for 2018 performance. 
Compensation Overview 
The primary goal of our executive compensation program is to align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders in a way that allows us to attract and retain the best executive talent. The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of our named executive officers, including setting base salaries, awarding bonuses and making equity awards to our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also oversees the company's equity plan. The Compensation Committee has designed a compensation program that rewards our named executive officers based on, among other things, metrics the Compensation Committee believes drives favorable long-term shareholder returns, the company's competitive position within our segment of the real estate industry and each executive officer's long-term career contributions to the company. Our compensation incentives that are designed to further these goals have taken the form of transaction bonuses, annual cash compensation and equity awards, and long-term cash and equity incentives for our named executive officers. 
Bonuses for executive officers for 2018 performance were based substantially on the achievement of pre-determined performance criteria. All equity awards to our named executive officers during 2018 were made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee in recognition of the accomplishment of significant corporate achievements. Future equity and cash bonuses may be measured by performance targets established in advance by our Compensation Committee. In addition, our Compensation Committee may decide to make awards to new executive officers to attract talented professionals. 
Our "named executive officers" are: David P. Singelyn, Chief Executive Officer and a trustee; John "Jack" Corrigan, Chief Operating Officer and a trustee; Christopher C. Lau, Chief Financial Officer; Sara H. Vogt-Lowell, Chief Legal Officer; Bryan Smith, Executive Vice President, President-Property Management; Stephanie G. Heim, Executive Vice President-Counsel; and Diana M. Laing, our former Chief Financial Officer who resigned in June 2018. 
2018 Compensation 
The various elements of our compensation program for executive officers are described in the section titled "Elements of Executive Officer Compensation." The Compensation Committee's consideration of each of these elements and 2018 compensation decisions are as follows. 
Compensation of the CEO 
As a founder and significant shareholder of the company, Mr. Singelyn has agreed to accept a below-market salary and has foregone any bonus or equity incentives during the Company's initial growth phase. During 2018, his base salary was set at $450,000, which the Compensation Committee believes is a conservative amount compared to the compensation levels of such officers at other publicly traded single-family rental home companies and real estate investment trusts. As has been true since the company's initial public offering, Mr. Singelyn waived receipt of any cash bonus or equity award for 2018 performance, despite the significant company achievements in 2018 that resulted from his leadership. As discussed below in the section titled "2019 Compensation Outlook," the Compensation Committee has increased Mr. Singelyn's base salary for 2019 and has established a bonus program and equity incentive program for him, in each case subject to achievement of certain performance targets. 
Compensation of the other Named Executive Officers 
Base salaries 
The Compensation Committee continued to hold cash compensation of our other named executive officers for 2018 at modest levels relative to pay levels at other real estate investment trusts of similar market capitalization. After considering the views of other Board members, the Compensation Committee set Mr. Corrigan's salary at $425,000. After considering the recommendations of Mr. Singelyn, the Compensation Committee set the base salaries for Mr. Lau and Mr. Smith at $300,000 each and the base salaries for Ms. Vogt-Lowell and Ms. Heim at $260,000. 
Performance-based Incentive Bonuses 
The incentive bonus target amount for 2018 for each executive officer was 75% of base salary as determined by the Compensation Committee. After considering the recommendations of Mr. Singelyn, the Committee set performance criteria for the 2018 bonus payments as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Relative Same-Home NOI Growth After Capital Expenditures      30%  
 Management Cost Efficiency      30%  
 Management Goals      25%  
 Discretionary      15%  
[END TABLE]
Relative Same-Home NOI Growth After Capital Expenditures 
For purposes of measuring the metrics for the 2018 corporate performance goals, Same-Home NOI after capital expenditures was calculated, using a pool of stabilized single-family properties, as rents and fees from single-family properties less core operating expenses and capital expenditures. Core property operating expenses are calculated as property operating expenses excluding expenses reimbursed by tenant charge backs and bad debt expense. 
Below are the bonus percentages payable at various targets set by the Compensation Committee for 2018 related to the Same-Home NOI after capital expenditures. In the event the target achieved is between target levels in the chart, the bonus percentage is adjusted accordingly.

[END TABLE]
Management Cost Efficiency 
Management Cost Efficiency was defined as Management Cost as a percent of rental and tenant fee revenue (excluding pass-through reimbursements.) Management Cost is defined to include controllable property management, leasing and administrative costs and excludes the cost of in-house maintenance services. 
Below are the bonus percentages payable at various targets set by the Compensation Committee for 2018 achievement of targeted Management Cost Efficiency. These are based on the percentage actual Management Cost Efficiency for 2017 of 11.01%.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Singelyn presented to the Compensation Committee his assessment of the performance of each named executive officer eligible for bonus payments and recommended that they be paid 100% of the portion of the bonus related to these goals. 
2018 Results 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee met to consider the payment of bonuses for 2018 performance for executive officers and reviewed the company's 2018 achievement of the Same-Home 
 NOI after capital expenditures of 2.67% compared to the peer measure of 2.99%. As a result, Same-Home NOI was 89% of the peer measure which met the 93% level for 30% of the bonus or a 27.90% of the total bonus amount for each executive officer. 
The Compensation Committee then reviewed the company's achievement of an 11.34% Management Cost Efficiency which met the threshold for payment of 100% of the 30% bonus amount attributable to achievement of this goal. As a result, based on the achievement of the corporate goals for bonus payments, each executive was entitled to a bonus payment of 57.9% of the 60% target amount. 
Mr. Singelyn then reviewed his bonus recommendations for each executive officer based on the achievement of the corporate and individual goals. All bonuses were 98% of the targeted amount. Based on these recommendations, the Compensation Committee awarded cash bonuses of $220,275 to each of Messrs. Lau and Smith and $190,905 to each of Ms. Vogt-Lowell and Ms. Heim to recognize their 2018 performance.

Equity Awards 
The Compensation Committee believes equity awards, consisting generally of a mix of share options and restricted share units ("RSUs"), help align management and shareholder interests. Because of the different features of share options and RSUs as described in more detail in the section titled "Elements of Executive Officer Compensation" below, the Compensation Committee determined that awards of a mix of both were appropriate. Accordingly, in February 2018, after considering Mr. Singelyn's recommendations, the Compensation Committee granted a share option to acquire 10,000 Class A common shares to each of Mr. Smith, Mr. Lau, Ms. Vogt-Lowell and Ms. Heim and 25,000 RSUs to each of Mr. Smith and Mr. Lau and 20,000 RSUs to each of Ms. Vogt-Lowell and Ms. Heim. The awards vest in equal annual installments over four years beginning one year from the date of grant. 
Factors Considered by the Compensation Committee in Making Decisions for 2018 
In evaluating executive officer compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered whether executives achieved the pre-established performance goals for payment of cash bonuses. The Committee also considered input from the other trustees and, for named executive officers reporting to him, the chief executive officer's input, as well as the business judgment and experience of each member of the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation. The Compensation Committee also considers publicly available information concerning the compensation practices of other comparable real estate companies. The Compensation Committee is authorized to retain third-party compensation consultants, but to date, it has not done so. Although the Compensation Committee's charter provides that the Compensation Committee may delegate its authority to members of the Compensation Committee, to date, the Compensation Committee has not done so. 
2019 Compensation Outlook 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed base salaries for 2019 and considered the recommendations of the Committee and other trustees with respect to Messrs. Singelyn and Corrigan and the recommendations of Mr. Singelyn for the executives that report to him. Following the Compensation Committee's review, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in base salaries to $550,000 for Mr. Singelyn, $525,000 for Mr. Corrigan, $375,000 for Mr. Smith, $350,000 for Mr. Lau, $285,000 for Ms. Vogt-Lowell and $275,000 for Ms. Heim. The Compensation Committee also established bonus targets for all executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee also awarded 30,000 RSUs to each of Messrs. Smith and Lau and 24,000 restricted shares units to each of Ms. Vogt-Lowell and Ms. Heim. The RSUs vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant. 
In addition, the Committee considered that Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg were required to repay outstanding loans from Ms. Gustavson by the end of 2019. The loans were originally made in connection with shares and operating partnership units acquired in connection with the start-up of the company. The repayments are expected to be accomplished by sales of the common shares held by each executive and/or refinancing all or a portion of the loans with third party lenders. As a result, the Committee concluded it would be appropriate to pay bonuses to these executives for 2019 performance if targets were achieved and the Committee also anticipates making equity awards to these individuals in early 2020. 
The Compensation Committee set the corporate performance criteria for executive officers 2019 incentive compensation payments based on achievement of targeted goals related to year-over-year growth in Core Funds from Operations (Core FFO) and Same-Home NOI after capital expenditures. 
Funds from Operations (FFO) is calculated as net income or loss, excluding gains and losses from sales or impairment of real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Core FFO adjusts FFO for (acquisition fees and costs expensed incurred with business combinations and the acquisition of properties, (2) noncash share-based compensation expense, (3) noncash interest expense related to acquired debt, (4) hurricane-related charges, net, (5) gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, (6) noncash fair value adjustments associated with remeasuring our participating preferred shares derivative liability to fair value and (7) the allocation of income to our participating preferred shares in connection with their redemption. 
Same-Home NOI after capital expenditures is calculated, using a pool of stabilized single-family properties, as rents and fees from single-family properties less core operating expenses and expenditures and capital expenditures. Core property operating expenses are calculated as property operating expenses excluding expenses reimbursed by tenant charge backs and bad debt expense. 
Role of Management in Determining the Compensation of Executive Officers 
Mr. Singelyn attends most meetings of the Compensation Committee. He does not vote on items before the Compensation Committee and is not present during the Compensation Committee's discussions and determination concerning his compensation. The Compensation Committee and the Board solicit his view on the performance of the executive officers reporting to him and consider his recommendations for their compensation. For 2018, the Compensation Committee set base salaries, bonus and equity compensation for our named executive officers after considering Mr. Singelyn's recommendations. They also considered the views of other Board members and reviewed and discussed the matter as a committee. 
Benchmarking Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee monitors the effectiveness of our executive compensation programs at least annually. For the compensation programs to be effective, the Compensation Committee believe that data of compensation practices at other public real estate companies with which we compete for talent is one tool in assessing and determining pay for our executive officers. The Compensation Committee uses benchmarking for informational purposes only and does not attempt to set compensation levels for executive officers at a target level relative to peer compensation. 
The Compensation Committee selected the following companies to be included in the peer group it uses for benchmarking executive compensation, based on industry, comparable size in terms of capitalization and assets and underlying business fundamentals.

Elements of Executive Officer Compensation 
The following is a summary of the elements of our compensation plans for fiscal year 2018 to our named executive officers. 
Annual Base Salary 
Base salaries are designed to compensate our named executive officers at a fixed level of compensation that serves as a retention tool throughout the executive's career. In determining base salaries, our Compensation Committee considers each named executive officer's role and responsibilities, unique skills, future potential with the company, salary levels for similar positions in our core markets and at our peer companies and internal pay equity. 
Cash Bonuses 
Annual cash bonuses are designed to incentivize our named executive officers at a variable level of compensation based on the performance of both the company and such individual. In connection with our annual cash bonus program, our Compensation Committee will determine annual performance criteria that are flexible and that change with the needs of our business. Our annual cash bonus plan is designed to (1) reward the achievement of specific, pre-established financial and operational objectives or (2) provide for awards based on the Compensation Committee's subjective evaluation of an executive's performance and accomplishments during the year. In addition, the Compensation Committee has discretion to award cash bonuses during the year for an executive's accomplishments with respect to a particular transaction or achievement although it did not do so in 2018. 
Historically, the view of the Compensation Committee was that while the company was in its early growth phase, management needed flexibility to respond to opportunities and challenges as they arose, and as a result, bonuses were determined solely on a discretionary basis at the end of the year when the Compensation Committee could review performance with 20/20 hindsight. Beginning in 2017, the Compensation Committee determined that a substantial portion of cash bonuses should be tied to pre-determined performance criteria. The criteria for 2018 bonuses is discussed above. 
Equity Awards 
We provide equity awards pursuant to our shareholder approved 2012 Incentive Plan. Equity awards are designed to focus our named executive officers on and reward them for their continued service and enhancing shareholder value by giving them an ongoing stake in the success of the business. Our executive officers may receive stock options, RSUs or a mix as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
Stock Options. Stock options have value solely to the extent that the price of our common shares is greater than the exercise price of the option at the time of exercise. Options help us retain executive officers because options vest over a multi-year period and achieve their maximum value to the executive only if he or she remains employed by the company for a period of years. 
Stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common shares on the date of grant, which ensures that the executive officer will not profit from the option unless the price of our common shares increases after the grant date. 
RSUs. RSUs increase in value as the value of our common shares increases, and vest over time, provided that the executive officer remains employed at the company. Awards of RSUs serve the Compensation Committee's objectives of retaining executive officers and motivating them. Unlike stock options, RSUs retain some value even in declining markets and may be particularly important to the company during difficult market conditions because of their value in retaining executive talent at times when we may need it most. 
Equity Grant Practices. Equity grants to all of our executive officers, including the named executive officers, must be approved by the Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent trustees. Grants occur only at meetings or upon written actions of the Board or the Compensation Committee and are made effective as of the date of the meeting or written action or a future date if appropriate, such as in the case of a new hire. The Compensation Committee has delegated limited authority to Mr. Singelyn to approve equity awards to employees who are not executive officers. 
Equity awards are not timed in coordination with the release of material non-public information. Awards are also subject to the terms of the 2012 Incentive Plan. 
All awards of stock options and RSUs granted to date under the 2012 Incentive Plan vest over four years. As provided in the plan, no awards may vest in less than one year. 
The Compensation Committee does not set awards based on a fixed weighting between stock options and RSUs. In general, the Compensation Committee considers equity awards for executive officers in connection with their annual performance review. In determining equity awards, our Compensation Committee takes into account, among other factors, input from other Board members, the company's overall financial performance, operational achievements, including acquisitions, and the recommendations of our chief executive officer for the named executive officers reporting to him. 
Term of Employment 
Each of our named executive officers serves at the pleasure of our Board. We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. 
Retirement Savings Opportunities 
All full-time employees, including our named executive officers, are able to participate in a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, or 401(k) plan, after a prescribed period of employment. We provide this plan to help our employees save for retirement in a tax efficient manner. Under the 401(k) plan, participating employees are eligible to defer a portion of their salary beginning the January 1 or July 1 that first follows the completion of six months of employment, and we, at our discretion, may make a matching contribution and/or a profit-sharing contribution commencing six months after they are eligible to begin contributing to the 401(k) plan. 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
We provide to all full-time employees, including our named executive officers, a competitive benefits package, which includes health and welfare benefits, such as medical, dental, short- and long-term disability insurance, and life insurance benefits. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as amended by the tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, imposes a $1,000,000 limit on the annual deduction that may be claimed for compensation paid to each of the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and certain other named executive officers of the company. Certain compensation awarded prior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may be excluded from the deduction limit under certain transition relief. Because we do not believe that Section 162(m) applies to our compensation, it is uncertain what effect, if any, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on the deductibility of our executive compensation. 
While the Compensation Committee considers the accounting impact of various forms of incentive compensation and compensation elements on the company's financial statements, accounting treatment is generally not the basis underlying the decision to award a particular form of compensation if the Compensation Committee deems the award the most appropriate incentive to achieve the company's compensation goals.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• all outstanding unvested RSUs and restricted share grants will vest immediately; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the sale of substantially all of the company's assets;

CEO Pay Ratio 
Presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, David P. Singelyn, to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding Mr. Singelyn). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
We have used the same median employee used for our 2017 CEO pay ratio. The Company believes there has been no change in its employee population or compensation arrangements that it believes would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. We selected the median employee based on the 1,129 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers employed by the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. In identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total cash compensation/W-2 compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2017. Total cash compensation for these purposes included base salary, cash incentives and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources/tax records, including Form W-2 information. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. 
The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our CEO was $473,000. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our median employee was $45,679. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 10.35 to 1. 
PROPOSAL 3 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
We are providing shareholders an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. The advisory vote is a non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the tabular disclosure regarding such compensation and the company's accompanying narrative disclosure. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. The advisory vote will be presented on an annual basis unless otherwise disclosed. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, more than 98.7% of the votes cast on this proposal were voted in favor of the company's executive compensation. The Compensation Committee considered the results of the favorable shareholder vote in making its 2018 compensation decisions for our named executive officers and did not make substantial changes to its executive compensation program. 
You are encouraged to carefully review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section as well as the information contained in the compensation tables and accompanying narrative discussion contained in this proxy statement. As described more fully in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, our compensation philosophy and practices seek to pay for performance and align shareholder and executive interests. 
Accordingly, we are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement by voting "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of American Homes 4 Rent approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion that accompanies the compensation tables." 
The vote on the compensation of our named executive is advisory and nonbinding on the company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering the company's executive compensation programs, will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding our named executive officers. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Before August 31, 2016, the company's sponsor, American Homes 4 Rent, LLC (AH LLC), owned, on a fully diluted basis, excluding partnership interests owned by the company and including all partnership units in our operating partnership owned by AH LLC, approximately 15.9% of the company. On August 31, 2016, AH LLC was liquidated and the ownership interests it held in the company were distributed to its members, including Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan, Goldberg and HF Investments, LLC. 
Registration Rights Agreement 
In connection with the internalization of our management, which was previously provided by AH LLC and its affiliates, we entered into a registration rights agreement with AH LLC providing for registration rights exercisable after December 10, 2015. The benefits of this registration rights agreement were transferred to the former members of AH LLC when it was liquidated, including Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg and HF Investments, LLC (collectively, the Reg Rights Holders). On February 26, 2019, we filed a resale prospectus supplement to register the Class A common shares owned by and issuable on conversion of operating partnership units owned by Messrs. Singelyn, Corrigan and Goldberg. 
Employment 
Mr. Corrigan's brother-in-law, Tom Maloney, is an employee of the company and received compensation during 2018 valued at approximately $180,900. 
Ms. Gustavson's son, Grant Gustavson, is an employee of the company and received compensation during 2018 valued at approximately $135,500. 
Related Party Transaction Approval Policy and Procedures 
We have adopted a written policy for the review and approval of related party transactions requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. This policy provides that either the Audit Committee or our full Board is responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving all interested transactions, meaning any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which (1) the amount involved may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the company or one of our subsidiaries will be a participant and (3) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A related person is defined as an executive officer, trustee or nominee for election as trustee, or a greater than 5% beneficial owner of our common shares, or an immediate family member of the foregoing. The policy may deem certain interested transactions to be pre-approved. 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUTTHE MEETING 
Date, time and place of the annual meeting: The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the company's office located at 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301. 
Purpose of this proxy solicitation: We are providing these proxy materials on behalf of the Board to ask for your vote and to solicit your proxies for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. We have made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail because you were a shareholder as of March 8, 2019 the record date fixed by the Board and are therefore entitled to receive Notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote on matters presented at the meeting. 
Important notice regarding delivery of security holder documents: We are pleased to take advantage of the SEC rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to you on the Internet. These rules allow us to provide our shareholders with the information they need while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. 
Our Annual Report to Shareholders (the Annual Report) includes a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019, excluding exhibits. On or about March 29, 2019, we mailed you a Notice containing instructions on how to access this proxy statement and our Annual Report and vote over the Internet. If you received the Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. The Notice instructs you on how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. If you received the Notice by mail and would like a printed copy of our proxy material, you should follow the instructions for requesting those materials included in the Notice. 
Availability of proxy statement and annual report: All shareholders receiving this proxy statement should have also received a paper copy or access to an electronic copy of the 2018 Annual Report, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additional copies are available at: www.americanhomes4rent.com on the Investor Relations section. The company will furnish any shareholder with a paper copy of the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, excluding exhibits, without charge, upon a written request to: Investor Relations, American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, California 91301. Copies of exhibits will be provided at a copying charge of $0.20 per page to reimburse us for a portion of the cost. 
Who can vote: Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date of March 8, 2019 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. On the record date, approximately 296,591,961 of the company's Class A common shares and 635,075 Class B common shares were issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A common shares and Class B common shares vote together on the matters for the election of trustees, ratification of the appointment of the company's independent registered public accounting firm and approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee and you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you will need to bring proof of ownership, such as a recent bank or brokerage account statement. 
Voting Rights. Each holder of Class A common shares is entitled to one vote per share. Each holder of Class B common shares is entitled to fifty votes per share. The company's dual class structure was put in place when the company was organized to provide voting rights to holders of non-voting units in the company's operating partnership corresponding with their equity ownership. All Class B shares are currently held by an affiliate of the Hughes Family, HF Investments, LLC. Including their ownership of common shares and operating partnership units, the Hughes Family owns approximately 25.35% of the company on a fully diluted basis. Including their Class B shares, the Hughes Family holds approximately 22.00% of the eligible votes for the Annual Meeting, which is less than their ownership in the company. 
How votes are counted: Provided that shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting are present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, each matter may be approved as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the election of trustees, trustee nominees receiving an affirmative majority of votes cast (i.e., the number of votes  cast "for" a trustee nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" or "withheld" from that nominee.) Common shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or  otherwise) will not affect the vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders or our common shares is required  to approve Proposal 2. Common shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will not affect the vote. For purposes of the foregoing, a majority of the votes cast means that the number  of votes that are cast and are voted "for" the resolution must exceed the number of votes that are voted "against" the resolution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The advisory vote on executive compensation in Proposal 3 is non-binding, however,  the Compensation Committee will consider and take into account the voting results in making future executive compensation decisions. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders of our common shares is  required to approve Proposal 3. Common shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will not affect the vote. For purposes of the foregoing, a majority of the votes cast means that  the number of votes that are cast and are voted "for" the resolution must exceed the number of votes that are voted "against" the resolution.  
[END TABLE]
Trustee nominees who do not receive a majority of the votes cast: If a nominee who is currently serving as a trustee is not re-elected, Maryland law provides that the trustee would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover" trustee. 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each trustee nominee who does not receive the required majority vote for election must submit a resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action. The Board would act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days from the date the election results were certified. If a trustee's resignation is accepted by the Board, the Board may fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board as provided in our bylaws. 
How to vote: 
If you attend the Annual Meeting: Shares held in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. Shares for which you are the beneficial owner but not the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the bank, broker, trustee or nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you don't attend the Annual Meeting: Whether you hold shares directly as the shareholder of record or through a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee as the beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. There are three ways to vote by proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet – Shareholders who receive a Notice about the Internet availability of  our proxy materials may submit proxies over the internet by following the instructions on the Notice. Shareholders who receive a paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail may submit proxies over the Internet by following the  instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone – If provided on your proxy card or voting instruction card, you may  submit proxies over the telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. When voting, you will need to have available the control number that appears on the card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail – Shareholders who received a paper copy of a proxy card or voting  instruction card by mail may submit proxies by completing, signing and dating their proxy card or voting instruction card and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope.  
[END TABLE]
Properly completed and submitted proxy cards and voting instruction cards and proxies properly submitted over the Internet, if received in time for voting and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained therein. 
How proxies will be voted: If you grant a proxy and do not revoke it before the applicable voting deadline, the persons designated as proxies will vote the common shares represented thereby, if any, in the manner specified. If you are a registered shareholder and grant a proxy but do not indicate how your shares should be voted on a matter, the common shares represented by your properly completed proxy/voting instruction card will be voted (1) "FOR" the election of each of the Board's ten nominees for trustee, (2) "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, (3) "FOR" approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. The persons designated as proxies reserve full discretion to cast votes for other persons if any of the nominees for trustee become unavailable to serve and to cumulate votes selectively among the nominees as to which authority to vote has not been withheld. 
If you hold shares through a broker or nominee and do not provided the broker or nominee with specific voting instructions, under the rules that govern brokers or nominees in such circumstances, your broker or nominee will have the discretion to vote such shares on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. As a result: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Your broker or nominee will not have the authority to exercise discretion to vote such shares with respect to proposals 1  and 3 because NYSE rules treat these matters as non-routine.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Your broker or nominee will have the authority to exercise discretion to vote such shares with respect to Proposal 2  because the matter is treated as routine under the NYSE rules.  
[END TABLE]
Broker non-votes will not be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum but will otherwise have no effect on the outcome of the vote on Proposals 1 and 3. 
Changing your vote: You may change your vote before the vote at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the following procedures. If you are the shareholder of record, you may change your vote (1) by mail by mailing a new proxy card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy), 
 (2) submit a later dated proxy over the Internet in accordance with the instructions set forth on the Internet voting website, (3) by providing a written notice of revocation to the Secretary at American Homes 4 Rent, 30601 Agoura Road, Suite 200, Agoura Hills, CA 91301, prior to your shares being voted, or (4) by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
Attendance at the Annual Meeting alone will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically make that request. For shares you hold beneficially in the name of a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker, trustee or nominee in accordance with their instructions, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your bank, broker, trustee or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person. 
Quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting: A quorum is required to hold the Annual Meeting. The presence at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 
A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If the shareholders present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting represent less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned to a later date for the purpose of obtaining a quorum. 
If additional matters are presented at the meeting: Other than the three items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, David P. Singelyn and John Corrigan, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If for any reason any of our nominees is not available as a candidate for trustee, the persons named as proxy holders will vote any shares represented by your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board. 
The Inspector of Elections: The inspector of elections will be a representative from our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. 
Contacting our transfer agent: Please contact our transfer agent at the phone number or address listed below, with questions concerning shares, dividend checks, transfer of ownership or other matters pertaining to your share account: American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, Shareholder Services, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, phone number: (800) 937-5449 or (718) 921-8124.

In addition to solicitation by mail, certain trustees, officers and regular employees of the company and its affiliates may solicit the return of proxies by telephone, personal interview or otherwise. We may also reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing the beneficial owners of our shares for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation materials to such beneficial owners.
