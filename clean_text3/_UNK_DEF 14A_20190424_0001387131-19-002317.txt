ELECTION OF TRUSTEE
Under the Trust's Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees may have up to 25 Trustees. Up to 12 Trustees may be Union Trustees, up to 12 Trustees may be Management Trustees, and one additional Trustee is to be the Chair. The Board of Trustees currently consists of 15 Trustees, eight (8) of whom are Union Trustees (Alvarez, Boland, Cooper, Durkee, McGarvey, Rigmaiden, Shuler and Trumka), six (6) of whom are Management Trustees (Gainer, Quinn, Rubin, Schmidt, Stanley and W. Thompson), and one (1) of whom is the Chair (Kanovsky).
The Declaration of Trust divides the Union and Management Trustees into three equal classes (each, a "Class"). Each Class is required to have, insofar as the pool of Trustees permits, an equal number of Union and Management Trustees. The term of each Class expires at the third Annual Meeting following its election; the term of one Class expires each year. Trustees elected to a Class after that Class' term has begun serve only the time remaining in that Class' term. Harry Thompson is standing for election for the first time as a Class II Management Trustee. If elected, he would serve the remaining two years of the term for Class II Trustees and would stand for reelection in 2021, or until his successor is elected and qualifies.
The principal occupations and business experience for at least the past five years of Mr. H. Thompson is described below under "Nominee for Election."
If the enclosed proxy is received from a Participant, the Units of Participation represented by such proxy will be voted for the nominee listed below (unless otherwise indicated on the proxy). Although the Trust does not contemplate that Mr. H. Thompson would be unavailable for election, if a vacancy should be occasioned by death or other unexpected occurrence, it is currently intended that the proxies will be voted for such other person, if any, as the Nominating Committee may recommend. Proxies will not be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.

Organization of Board of Trustees 
Under the terms of the Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees has overall responsibility for the management and policies of the Trust. The HIT believes the board leadership structure described in this document is appropriate for the HIT given its size, purpose, holdings and risk profile in order to provide the necessary oversight and risk mitigation in a flexible and efficient manner.
The Board of Trustees maintains four committees: the Executive Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Committee of the Whole.
The current members of the Executive Committee are Chair Kanovsky and Trustees Quinn, Rigmaiden, Shuler, Stanley and Trumka. None of these persons is an interested person, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Committee chooses one of its members to serve as Chair of the Committee. The Executive Committee has all the authority of the Board of Trustees when the Board is not in session. The Executive Committee met once during 2018 and has met once in 2019 as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
No committee functions as a compensation committee. The Executive Committee, however, may make recommendations to the Board of Trustees concerning compensation payable to Trustees acting in their capacities as trustees and compensation payable to some executive officers. See "COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS."
Individuals are not eligible to invest in the HIT and none of the Trustees or officers owns any Units of the HIT.
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee is a separately chartered committee which was formally constituted by the Board of Trustees on April 7, 2004. The current members of the Nominating Committee are Trustees Shuler (Chair), McGarvey and Gainer. None of these persons is an interested person, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Nominating Committee is responsible for the nomination of persons to serve as members of the Board of Trustees. The Nominating Committee met twice in 2018 and has met once in 2019 as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
The Nominating Committee has a charter, a copy of which was filed as an appendix to the May 18, 2005 Proxy Statement. Pursuant to Section (4) of its charter, the Nominating Committee will consider Trustee candidates recommended by Participants. The Nominating Committee has not adopted formal procedures to be followed by Participants in submitting such recommendations. However, it is the practice of the Board of Trustees, the members of which are disinterested, to set a record date by which Participants in the Trust may submit matters for consideration by the Participants at the Annual Meeting, including recommendations for Trustee candidates. Once received, the Nominating Committee reviews the eligibility of each candidate in accordance with the criteria set forth in the charter.
All candidates are evaluated in the same manner, regardless of the process by which they were recommended. Pursuant to the Nominating Committee charter, candidates are evaluated by the Committee in terms of relevant experience that would enable the candidate to serve effectively as a Trustee, as well as compatibility with respect to the Trust's mission. In addition, candidates are evaluated based on their eligibility to serve under the Trust's Declaration of Trust. When a viable candidate has been identified, the members of the Committee may conduct in-person interviews of such candidate. When all of the candidates recommended to the Committee have been evaluated and, if applicable, interviewed, the Committee will determine which of the viable candidates should be presented to the Board of Trustees of the Trust for nomination to Participants to become a member of the Board of Trustees of the Trust. The Trustees' policy is to nominate Trustees in a manner that seeks to produce the best candidates with a diversity of qualities, experience, backgrounds and complementary skills.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a separately constituted committee within the meaning of Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It monitors the accounting practices and performance of Trust management and the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board of Trustees previously selected Harry Thompson to serve as Chair of the Audit Committee and designated him as an Audit Committee Financial Expert, subject to his approval for election as Trustee, and Trustees Boland, Quinn, Shuler and Stanley to serve as the other members of the Committee. None of these persons would be interested persons, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Trustees, a copy of which was included as an appendix to the proxy statement filed with the SEC on May 18, 2005. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee must meet annually with the independent registered public accounting firm to review the audit outside the presence of Trust management, as necessary. The Audit Committee met twice in 2018 and has met once in 2019 as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
Committee of the Whole
The Committee of the Whole monitors the Trust's investment practices and policies, reviews proposed changes thereto, considers new investment practices and policies and oversees the marketing policies and strategies of the Trust. This Committee is currently composed of all Trustees. It did not meet in 2018 and has not met year-to-date 2019.
Board of Trustees
The Board of Trustees met eight times during the Trust's fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and has met once in 2019 as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Trustees Cooper, Durkee, Rigmaiden, Shuler and Trumka each attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings of the Board of Trustees (held during the period for which they were Trustees) and (2) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Trustees on which they served (during the periods that they served) during the 2018 fiscal year. Board members who have been unable to attend meetings due to scheduling conflicts receive all materials and are regularly briefed on matters before the Board of Trustees.
Because the Trust's Participants are primarily eligible pension plans, Participants have ready access to the Board of Trustees, both collectively and individually. This may be accomplished by contacting, in the first instance, the Trust's Chief Operating Officer. Participants may also contact Trustees directly (several of whom sit on the Boards of Participants). In addition, because historically the Trust's Board of Trustees has been comprised solely of independent trustees and an independent Chair, the Trust has no policy with respect to Trustee attendance at the Annual Meeting. No Trustees or Participants attended the Annual Meeting in 2018.
Consistent with its overall responsibility for the management and policies of the HIT, the Board of Trustees oversees risk management of the HIT directly and, indirectly, through its committee structure and delegations to HIT management. The Board of Trustees has adopted and periodically reviews and approves policies and procedures which are designed to address areas of potential concern, such as valuation, liquidity, internal controls, and portfolio management and which regulate the daily business conduct of the HIT. The Board of Trustees requires regular reports from Trust management on matters related to risk both at its regular meetings and periodically throughout the year. The Chief Financial Officer reports regularly to the Board of Trustees and the Audit Committee on matters related to internal controls, audits and accounting. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Board of Trustees in person and in writing regarding the effectiveness of the HIT's compliance program and other compliance related matters at least annually. In addition, the Board of Trustees and the Audit Committee require regular reports from independent valuation validation consultants and the HIT's independent auditor and periodic reports from outside counsel and fund compliance service providers to assist its risk management efforts.
Compensation of Trustees and Executive Officers 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Chair Kanovsky received $10,000 in compensation. The Trust paid each Management Trustee who did not waive such fee $500 per day for participation at Board of Trustees and committee meetings. The Trust paid no fee to any Union Trustee. The aggregate compensation paid to Trustees in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $19,500. The Trust reimbursed all Trustees for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board of Trustees and committee meetings.
2018 Compensation Table
The following table sets forth the aggregate compensation from the HIT to each of the three highest paid officers of the HIT and to all Trustees of the HIT in 2018. Mr. Coyle, listed below, retired from his position of Chief Executive Officer, in September 2018, at which time Mr. Suh was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Portfolio Manager. The HIT is a single, self-managed fund, and its staff as of December 31, 2018 included 49 employees. Therefore, in addition to those individuals identified in the table below, the HIT had 45 other employees who earned aggregate compensation exceeding $60,000 during the 2018 fiscal year.

1       The estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement at normal retirement age to the executive officers of the HIT, other than Mr. Coyle who does not participate in the Retirement Plan, are determined primarily by a formula based on final average salary and years of service and assume that the officers retire at ages that are consistent with IRS requirements. See "RETIREMENT PLANS" below. The estimated annual benefits of Mr. Coyle cannot be determined because annual payments vary year to year from 2019 through 2031 based on elections made. These annual payments range from $52,469 to $814,428 and average $167,586. 
2       Aggregate HIT compensation includes $18,500 of deferred compensation in 2018 under the 401 (k) Plan, and excludes amounts contributed to the Retirement Plan on Mr. Suh's behalf.

The HIT participates in the AFL-CIO Staff Retirement Plan (the "Staff Retirement Plan") with regard to all of its employees. However, the former Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Coyle, was ineligible by the terms of the Staff Retirement Plan. Mr. Coyle participated in a separate non-qualified retirement plan beginning at the start of his employment in 1992. The HIT sponsors the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") described below for all of its employees.
1       Ms. Spear served as a Trustee in 2018 but did not stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Participants.
RETIREMENT PLANS
Under the Staff Retirement Plan, contributions are based on an eligible employee's base salary. The Internal Revenue Service imposes an annual maximum on the amount that can be included in determining base salary during 2018, which amount was $275,000. In general, employer contribution rates are determined actuarially every year. The Staff Retirement Plan was funded by employer contributions at rates of approximately 24.00% of eligible employees' base salaries during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. During 2018, the annual base salary for pension purposes of Ms. Khatchadourian and Mr. Suh was $250,000 each consistent with the terms of the current salary freeze in Final Average Salary explained below.
The Staff Retirement Plan is open to employees of the AFL-CIO and other participating employers that are approved by the Staff Retirement Plan's board of trustees and that make contributions to the Staff Retirement Plan on their behalf. Such employees become members of the Staff Retirement Plan on their first day of employment that they are scheduled to work at least 1,000 hours during the next 12 consecutive months.
The Staff Retirement Plan provides a retirement pension to eligible employees for life, beginning at age 65 if the employee has at least three years of credited service, beginning at age 60 if the employee has at least 10 years of credited service, or beginning at age 50 if the employee's age plus years of credited service equals 80 or more. The amount of this pension depends on average base salary and years of credited service at retirement. Eligible employees will receive 3.00% of an average of their highest three years' base earnings ("Final Average Salary") for each year of credited service up to 25 years, and 0.5% of their Final Average Salary of each year of credited service over 25 years. This calculated amount is subject to (1) Internal Revenue Service limits, (2) the Staff Retirement Plan modification noted below and (3) certain elections related to survivor benefits made by the employee at the time of retirement. The Staff Retirement Plan modified the calculation of the Final Average Salary effective June 30, 2014 such that, the Final Average Salary would be frozen for vested employees and would be capped as the average of the first three years of service for unvested employees.
Set forth below is a table showing estimated annual benefits payable upon retirement in specified compensation and years of service classifications. As of the date hereof, Ms. Khatchadourian has approximately 25 and Mr. Suh has approximately 20 credited years of service under the Staff Retirement Plan.

Mr. Coyle, the Chief Executive Officer of the HIT from February 1992 to September 2018, separately participated in a non-qualified retirement plan, commonly referred to as a "top hat plan," maintained by HIT. Under this plan, Mr. Coyle received a company credit under the plan equal to one-third of his salary with an option to defer additional amounts consistent with tax laws. All amounts under the plan are vested. Amounts deferred under the plan are being distributed in accordance with elections made by Mr. Coyle. The HIT carries the accrued liability for the benefit under the plan in its financial statements and pays benefits as prescribed by the plan. 
7     The Internal Revenue Code limits the permissible benefit payments that may be paid under the Retirement Plan. Consequently, the amounts of retirement benefits that actually may be paid to individual employees may be significantly lower than shown, depending on several factors, including but not limited to the employee's years of service, level of compensation, and actual year of retirement.
8        3.00% per year up to 25 years.
9      0.5% per year over 25 years.
THE 401(K) PLAN
Under the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust 401(k) Plan, an eligible employee may designate to set aside up to 100% of his or her total compensation, up to the IRS maximum. The HIT is matching dollar-for-dollar the first $6,200 contributed in 2019. The amount deferred by an eligible employee and the amount of the HIT's matching contribution, if any, will be deposited in a trust account in the employee's name and vests immediately. Every employee of the HIT is eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan provided such employee has reached the age of 21 and is not a nonresident alien. An eligible employee may enroll in the 401(k) Plan at any time during the year.
When a participating employee terminates his or her employment, retires or becomes disabled, the employee will be able to receive as a lump sum payment the salary reduction amounts that were contributed to the trust account on the employee's behalf, the additional amounts that the HIT contributed to the trust account on the employee's behalf, plus income earned (or less losses incurred) as a result of investment of these contributions (less the employee's allocated share of expenses).
Except as noted below, an actively working employee under age 59 ½ cannot withdraw these amounts unless the employee has a financial hardship.  A financial hardship is an immediate and heavy financial need for which the employee has no other available resources, and includes medical expenses, the purchase of a primary residence, the payment of tuition and related educational fees, funeral expenses of an immediate family member, and the need to prevent eviction from, or foreclosure of the mortgage of, the employee's primary residence.  The employee will be required to present evidence of the financial hardship and upon submission of such evidence may be entitled to withdraw an amount, up to the 401(k) contribution basis in the employee's account, plus the vested value of Employer Matching contributions, to meet the immediate financial need.
The amount in an employee's account must be distributed to the employee in one lump sum or in periodic installments beginning no later than April 1st of the year following the year in which the employee retires after reaching age 70½.  Additionally, these amounts must be distributed within a reasonable time following the termination of the 401(k) Plan or, when requested, the termination of the employee's employment.  An actively working employee will be entitled to receive a distribution of the amounts in their account upon the employee's attainment of age 65.  A participating employee may borrow from his or her account subject to certain prescribed limitations.
