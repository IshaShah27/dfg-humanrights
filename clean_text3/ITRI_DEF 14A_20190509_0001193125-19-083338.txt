[END TABLE]

Record Date and Outstanding Shares 
Holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 1, 2019, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting. On the record date, there were 39,854,779 shares of our common stock outstanding. Each outstanding share of our common stock will entitle its holder to one vote on each of the three directors to be elected and one vote on each other matter to be voted on at the annual meeting. Each of our directors and executive officers intends to vote or direct the vote of all shares of common stock over which he or she has voting control in favor of: (1) the election of the nominees for director; (2) the advisory approval of the compensation we paid our named executive officers in 2018; and (3) the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accountant. 
-1- 
Quorum and Voting 
Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share of common stock held on each matter to be voted on. The presence at the annual meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock on the record date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (shares held by a broker or nominee who does not have the authority, express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) on any of the proposals to be voted on will be counted only for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
You may vote your shares in one of several ways, depending on how you own your shares. 
Registered Shareholders (Shares held in your name) 
Registered shareholders can vote in person, by Internet, by telephone, or by mail, by casting their vote as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1)  Accessing the Internet website specified in the Notice of Internet Availability and following the instructions provided  on the website (or if printed copies of the proxy materials were requested, as specified in the printed proxy card); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2)  Requesting a printed proxy card and either calling the telephone number specified on the proxy card and following the  instructions provided on the phone line, or completing, signing, dating, and promptly mailing the proxy card in the envelope provided; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3)  Attending and voting in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Shareholders (Shares held in the name of a broker, bank or other holder of record on your behalf) 
If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank, or other nominee or holder of record, follow the voting instructions on the voting instruction form provided to you by the holder of record to vote your shares. 
Proposal One – Election of Directors: Each nominee for director is elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election (meaning the number of votes cast "for" a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" such nominee). Holders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative votes in the election of directors. Abstentions from voting on this matter will not be counted. Brokers and other holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority to vote your shares in the election of directors, absent voting instructions from you. Therefore, if you are a beneficial shareholder and do not provide voting instructions on proposal number one to the holder of record for your shares, they will not be voted in the election of directors. 
Proposal Two – Say-on-Pay Vote (non-binding): The non-binding advisory vote on this proposal will be approved if the majority of votes cast are in favor of the proposal (meaning the number of votes cast "for" the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the proposal). Abstentions from voting on this matter will not be counted. Brokers and other holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority to vote your shares for this proposal, absent voting instructions from you. Therefore, if you are a beneficial shareholder and do not provide voting instructions on proposal number two to the holder of record for your shares, they will not be voted on this proposal. 
Proposal Three – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor: The appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountant for 2019 will be ratified if the majority of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal (meaning the number of votes cast "for" the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the proposal). Abstentions from voting on this matter will not be counted. Brokers and other holders of record do have discretionary authority to vote 
-2- 
 shares on this matter. Therefore, there will be no broker non-votes on the ratification of the Company's independent registered public accountant. 
Unless contrary instructions are specified, if the proxy is completed and submitted (and not revoked) prior to the annual meeting, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as follows: (i) FOR proposals one, two, and three; and (ii) in accordance with the best judgment of the named proxies on any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting. 
Revocability of Proxies 
Shares represented at the annual meeting by properly signed proxies will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions given in the proxy. A shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time before the vote. Mere attendance at the annual meeting will not revoke a proxy. A proxy may be revoked only by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    submitting a later-dated proxy by mail, by Internet or by telephone for the same shares at any time before the proxy is  voted;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    delivering written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at any time before the vote; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    attending the annual meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If the annual meeting is postponed or adjourned for any reason, at any subsequent reconvening of the annual meeting, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been voted at the original convening of the annual meeting (except for any proxies that have at that time effectively been revoked or withdrawn). 
Proxy Solicitation 
For the 2019 annual meeting, we have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to aid in the solicitation of proxies. We will bear the cost of such solicitation of proxies, which we estimate will be approximately $10,000, plus expenses. Proxies may be solicited by personal contact, mail, email, telephone, or facsimile. In addition, we may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of our common stock for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners. Our directors, officers, and employees may also solicit proxies personally or by telephone, without additional compensation.

PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board of Directors (Board) is divided into three classes, with each director holding office for a three-year term or until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (Annual Meeting), shareholders are being asked to re-elect three Class 3 directors for terms of three years or until their death, resignation, or removal from office or their successors are duly elected and qualified. Unless authority is withheld, the persons named as proxies will vote for the election of the nominees listed below. If any of the nominees become unavailable to serve, the persons named as proxies will have discretionary authority to vote for a substitute nominee. 
Our Board has nominated the following persons for election to the Board. Each nominee is currently a director and has indicated that he or she is willing and able to continue to serve as a director. 
Class 3 (to serve until the 2022 annual meeting) 
Lynda L. Ziegler 
Thomas S. Glanville 
Diana D. Tremblay 
We have concluded that each of the nominees for re-election, as well as the other directors who will continue in office, have the skills, experience, knowledge, and personal attributes that are necessary to effectively serve on our Board. As described below in their biographies and the section "Director and Director Nominee Qualifications" that follows, the qualifications of our directors and director nominees support our conclusion that each of the individuals should serve as a director in light of our current business operations and structure. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the election of each of the Class 3 director  nominees.

** Serves as member of the Compensation Committee of our Board or has overseen compensation and benefits in a management capacity. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee generally considers diversity as one of several factors relating to overall composition when making nominations to our Board. Although we do not have a formal policy governing how diversity is considered, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee generally considers diversity by examining the entire Board membership and, when making nominations to our Board, reviewing the diversity of the entire Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee construes Board diversity broadly to include many factors, including, but not limited to, gender, age, and ethnicity. As a result, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to ensure that our Board is represented by individuals with a variety of different opinions, perspectives, personal, professional, and industry experience and backgrounds, skills, and expertise. Currently, of the eight independent directors on our Board who are nominees or continuing on the Board after the Annual Meeting, three are either former Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) or former Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), two are under the age of 60, six have global business experience, and two are women, including our Board Chair. 
Director Qualifications and Attributes 
We have concluded that all of our directors, including the nominees for re-election, have the skills, experience, knowledge, and personal attributes that are necessary to effectively serve on our Board and to contribute to the overall success of our Company. We believe that the diverse background of each of our Board members ensures that we have a Board that has a broad range of industry-related knowledge, experience, and business acumen. See also "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE – Director Nominations by Shareholders" in this proxy statement. 
Compensation of Directors 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews compensation paid to non-employee directors and makes recommendations for adjustment, as appropriate, to the Board. The Company did not change the compensation paid to non-employee directors for the 2018 fiscal year. Both equity and cash compensation were determined using benchmark data from our peer companies provided by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co. (F.W. Cook).

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Since 2006, we have maintained stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors. We expect our directors to accumulate shares equal to five times their annual cash retainer within five years from their initial appointment or election as a director, or to be making progress towards meeting the guidelines. For our Board Chair that equates to a value of $600,000, and for the other directors, it equates to a value of $325,000. All of our non-employee directors currently comply with these ownership guidelines. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan dated January 1, 2012, our non-employee directors are eligible to participate in that plan and may defer up to 100% of any director fees and 100% of any shares of common stock that he or she anticipates receiving into a nonqualified account.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors 
The leadership of our Board is managed by our Board Chair. Our Corporate Governance Guiding Principles (Governance Principles) generally require the role of Board Chair to be held by an independent director who meets the independence requirements of NASDAQ. The Board believes having separate roles of Board Chair and CEO allows for a more balanced workload between the Board Chair and the CEO, especially in light of the current duties and responsibilities of the Board Chair, which include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Preside over all meetings of the Board (including executive sessions of the Board) and meetings of the shareholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Review the agendas of each Board and committee meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Prepare agendas as needed for executive sessions of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Serve as a liaison between the independent directors and the CEO;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    In consultation with the CEO, make recommendations to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as to membership of  Board committees and appointment of Board committee Chairs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Perform such other duties as the Board may require.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the Governance Principles, the Board Chair must be an independent director unless the Board determines that the best interests of shareholders would otherwise be better served. The Board Chair is elected by the members of the Board following the annual meeting of shareholders (or at such other time as a vacancy for the role of Board Chair may occur). The Board Chair serves for a term of three years (provided such director is re-elected by shareholders if his or her term as a director does not coincide with his or her term as Board Chair). The Board Chair may not serve more than two consecutive terms, unless the Board approves an extended term. Our current Chair, Lynda L. Zeigler, is serving her first term that will expire at the 2019 annual meeting. 
If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to combine the roles of CEO and Board Chair, the Board will appoint a Lead Independent Director with the duties set forth in the Governance Principles. 
The current Governance Principles, as amended, may be found online at www.itron.com by selecting "Investors" and then "Corporate Governance." See "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" in this proxy statement for additional information on our Board. 
Corporate Governance Guiding Principles 
The Company's Governance Principles are available on the Company's website, www.itron.com, by selecting "Investors" and then "Corporate Governance." 
Board Matters – Meeting Attendance 
Our business, property, and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Members of our Board are kept informed of our business through discussions with our CEO and other officers, by reviewing materials provided to them, by visiting our offices, and by participating in meetings of the Board and its committees. 
In accordance with our Governance Principles, directors are expected to attend the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. All our directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders in person. 
-13- 
 During 2018, the Board met seven times. All the directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served. Also, in accordance with our Governance Principles, our independent directors meet in an executive session as often as necessary, but no less than four times annually. 
Director Independence 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Under the rules of NASDAQ, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company's board of directors. In addition, the rules of NASDAQ require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Under the rules of NASDAQ, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if that company's board of directors determines that the person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
As recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has determined that a majority of our Board are independent directors as defined under the rules of NASDAQ and the SEC, with Mr. Mezey serving as the sole non-independent director. As Mr. Mezey does not sit on any committees, and as recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has determined that all members of Itron's committees are independent under SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards. In addition, as recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has determined that all members of our Audit/Finance Committee are independent under Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
Committees of the Board 
We have three committees to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities: Nominating and Corporate Governance, Audit/Finance, and Compensation. The Value Enhancement Committee was not renewed following the February 2018 meeting. Each of the three current committees operates under a written charter that has been approved by the Board. The committee charters are reviewed annually and are updated as necessary to reflect changes in regulatory requirements and evolving oversight practices. In 2018, all of the committee charters were amended, as described below, and all three of the current committee charters are available on our website at http://investors.itron.com/corporate-governance-0. The table below provides membership of each committee at the end of fiscal year 2018, followed by a description of each committee's responsibilities.

In order to determine this, the Board requires our executive officers, directors and director nominees to disclose certain information regarding related person transactions. A "related person transaction" generally is a transaction (including any indebtedness or a guarantee of indebtedness) that involves the Company's directors, executive officers, director nominees, 5% or more beneficial owners of the Company's common stock, immediate family members of these persons, or entities in which one of these persons has a direct or indirect material interest. The current threshold required to be disclosed under SEC regulations is $120,000. Under its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board has been delegated with the responsibility of reviewing and approving any related person transactions. 
Our Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, including, as part of regular Board and committee meetings, general oversight of our executives' management of risks relevant to the Company. The Board determines, directly or through Board committees, whether: (i) there are adequate processes designed and implemented by Company management such that risks have been identified and are being managed; (ii) the risk management processes are intended to ensure that Company risks are taken into account in corporate decision-making; and (iii) the risk management processes and procedures ensure that material risks to the Company are brought to the attention of the Board or an appropriate committee of the Board. Each of the Company's risk management processes are reviewed periodically (but at least once a year) by either the Board or an appropriate committee to which the Board has delegated specific oversight responsibility, as described below. Throughout the year, the Board and each committee spend a portion of their time reviewing and discussing specific risk topics. Committee Chairs regularly report to the full Board on actions taken at committee meetings. At least annually, the Board conducts a review of our long-term strategic plans, 
-16- 
 and at each of our quarterly meetings, our General Counsel updates the Board on material legal and regulatory matters.

Following a review of the Company's current risk management systems and processes, the Board has concluded that the current allocation of oversight responsibilities between the Board and its committees is adequate, provided that the committees continue to coordinate their risk oversight responsibilities, share information appropriately with the other Board members, and provide timely and adequate reports to the full Board. The Board continually evaluates its risk oversight role. 
Code of Conduct 
The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all directors, officers, and employees of the Company and any subsidiary of the Company and is available on the Company's website, www.itron.com, by selecting "Investors" and then "Corporate Governance." In addition, we have adopted policies and procedures for reporting and investigating suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. The Company intends to satisfy any future disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding an amendment to or waiver from application of the code of ethics or provisions of the Code of Conduct, that applies to the CEO or the CFO, by posting such information on our website, www.itron.com.

Anti-Hedging Policy 
The Company has adopted an Anti-Hedging Policy that prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from entering into transactions involving our securities that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Itron securities. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – CD&A – Anti-Hedging Policy" in this proxy statement for more information on this policy. 
Incentive Repayment (Clawback) Policy 
The Company has adopted a repayment or "clawback" policy, which provides that if a bonus or equity award (Award) is paid that is conditioned on meeting certain financial metrics, and, subsequently, there is a required financial restatement, which, had the correct information been known at the time, would have resulted in a lower Award, then the Board has the right to demand repayment of the excess amount of the Award, net of taxes, from an executive officer who has received an Award. If the Board (or its delegated committee) determines that fraud has resulted in a material financial restatement, it is required that the Board demand repayment from the executive officer engaged in the fraud of the full Award, net of taxes. 
Director Nominations by Shareholders 
In accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, in order to nominate a director for election to the Board at an annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must deliver written notice of such nomination to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the Company's executive offices no fewer than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting (or if less than 60 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is given or made to the shareholders, not later than the tenth day following the day on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure was made). The notice of a shareholder's intention to nominate a director must include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name and address of the shareholder;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a representation that the shareholder is entitled to vote at the meeting at which directors will be elected;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement of the number of shares of the Company that are beneficially owned by the shareholder;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consent of such nominee to serve as a director, if elected.  
[END TABLE]
Other directors and senior management of the Company may also recommend director nominees for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates director nominees, including nominees that are submitted to the Company by a shareholder, taking into consideration the qualification criteria set forth under 
-18- 
 "ELECTION OF DIRECTORS – Director and Director Nominee Qualifications" in this proxy statement. In the event of a shareholder recommendation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee screens and evaluates the person recommended in the same manner as other candidates. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines if the proposed director nominee will have sufficient time available to effectively carry out his or her Board duties and responsibilities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may then recommend the director candidate to the Board for its consideration, if deemed appropriate. 
Shareholder Communications with the Board 
The Company's Board provides a process whereby shareholders may contact the Board or any committee as a group or any committee Chair or individual director, by email addressed to boardofdirectors@itron.com. Shareholders should clearly specify in each communication the name of the director to whom the communication is addressed. Shareholders may also write to the Board or any committee as a group or any committee Chair or individual director by sending the communication to: Itron, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 2111 N. Molter Road, Liberty Lake, WA 99019. Communications may also be submitted through our website at www.itron.com by selecting "Investors," "Corporate Governance," and then "Contact the Board." 
Shareholder communications are delivered directly to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, who then determines whether to forward such communications to the specified director addressees. You can access a description of the process that the Corporate Secretary uses for determining whether to forward shareholders' communications to directors at our website, www.itron.com, by selecting "Investors," "Corporate Governance," and then "Contact the Board."

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (Say-on-Pay) 
We are asking our shareholders to approve a non-binding advisory resolution on the Company's executive compensation programs for our named executive officers (NEOs) (commonly known as "say-on-pay") as we have described them in this proxy statement. Although this advisory vote is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation decisions for our executives. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) section of this proxy statement, we believe our compensation programs are reasonable, competitive and strongly focused on pay-for-performance principles that will result in the creation of long-term shareholder value. Some of the features of our compensation programs that illustrate our philosophy are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    A significant portion of an NEOs compensation is at-risk or performance-based  and subject to the Companys operating and financial performance. We consider annual cash-based incentives, equity long-term incentives, and stock options to be performance-based, because each of these three elements is valuable to the  executive only if performance goals are achieved and/or our share price improves. In fiscal year 2018, the executive compensation package (base salary and short- and long-term incentives at target) included 85% of  at-risk compensation for the CEO and an average of 76% of at-risk compensation for the other NEOs. Our long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for equity awards granted  under our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (A&R 2010 Plan) or Second A&R 2010 Plan, as applicable has three-year performance periods, with one-year averages determined each year for  measurement purposes, to encourage NEOs to make decisions that align our long-term goals with shareholder interests and to discourage excessive risk taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Stock ownership guidelines require executive officers to acquire and hold certain amounts of Itron stock to further  strengthen alignment of managements interest with those of our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    We have established an Incentive Repayment (Clawback) Policy that covers awards under all of our incentive programs, and  provides that if a bonus or equity award is paid that is conditional on meeting certain financial metrics, and subsequently, there is a required material financial restatement, which, had the correct information been known at the time, would have  resulted in a lower award, then the Board (or its delegated committee) has the right to demand repayment of the excess amount of the award, net of taxes. If the Board (or its delegated committee) determines that fraud has resulted in a material  financial restatement, it is required that the Board demand repayment of the full award, net of taxes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    We maintain our long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance by continuing our policies of (i) separate  Board Chair and CEO roles, (ii) majority voting for directors, (iii) all independent Board members (except our CEO) and all independent committee members, (iv) executive sessions of independent directors after each quarterly Board  meeting, and (v) prohibition on hedging or pledging of Itron stock by our executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The compensation of our NEOs varies depending upon the achievement of  pre-established performance goals determined by the Compensation Committee (or the independent members of the Board, for the CEO), which are intended to serve as incentives for our executives. When  performance does not meet the pre-established target goals, as was the case in prior years and in 2018, then the amount of compensation paid to our executives is correspondingly reduced or eliminated.  Conversely, when the Companys operating and financial performance meets or exceeds the pre-established performance metrics, then the amount of compensation paid to our executives increases. See  The 2018 Executive Compensation Program in Detail in the CD&A.  
[END TABLE]
-20- 
We believe our executive compensation policies have enabled us to retain and attract exceptional senior executives whose talent and experience have helped Itron become a leader in our industry. Our Compensation Committee (and for the CEO compensation also the independent members of the Board), which provides overall direction for our compensation programs, believes the fiscal year 2018 compensation paid to our NEOs is reasonable and appropriate and adequately reflects the Company's overall performance in 2018. 
Shareholders are encouraged to read the full details of our executive compensation programs as described in the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement. 
For the reasons provided above, we recommend that the shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and compensation tables along with the accompanying footnotes and narrative disclosures of the proxy statement.

Executive Summary 
Business Performance 
In 2018, Itron continued to execute on strategic initiatives to deliver long-term value for our investors. We encountered supply chain headwinds throughout the year that impacted revenue and profitability. While we were able to mitigate some of the impact through cost controls, including reduced discretionary spending and the elimination of executive and management variable compensation, we fell short on our financial targets. Revenue, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share(1) (EPS), and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)(1)(2) metrics are all strongly embedded in our executive compensation program, which resulted in zero payment in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Total Company consolidated revenue of $2.4 billion increased 18% from 2017, driven by the acquisition of Silver Spring  Networks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Total Company Adjusted EBITDA of $235.8 million improved by 2% percent over 2017; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Non-GAAP EPS of $2.65 decreased 13% from 2017.  
[END TABLE]
Despite the near-term headwinds that impacted 2018 financial results, Itron's executive leadership team remained focused on the Company's strategic vision to be a leading partner with utilities and cities to safely, securely and reliably deliver critical infrastructure services. We gained significant momentum on our strategy during the year. First, we strengthened our position in the Smart Energy and Smart City space with the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks. We are progressing well with synergy targets and the technology convergence roadmap to deliver a unified, highly-secure, value-generating solution that leaves no customer behind. Second, in October, we realigned our business segments to Device Solutions, Networked Solutions and Outcomes. This shift supports our strategy to accelerate growth in higher value network and outcomes-based solutions, while providing investors with valuable insight into our operations. Lastly, management continues to be focused on our commitment on expanding margins and executing on operational cost improvements through restructuring programs and other operational efficiency programs. Together, we expect these initiatives to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. 
Compensation Highlights 
Our executive compensation program has three primary elements: base salary, annual cash incentives (as part of our Executive Management Incentive Plan (EMIP)), and long-term equity incentives (as part of our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)). Each of these compensation elements serves a specific purpose in our compensation strategy. Base salary is an essential component to any market-competitive compensation program. Annual incentives reward the achievement of short-term goals, while long-term incentives drive our NEOs to focus on shareholder value creation. Based on our performance and consistent with the design of our program, the Compensation Committee made the following executive compensation decisions for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    None of the NEOs received base salary adjustments in 2018, except for Mr. Mezey, who received a 3% increase to better  align his base salary with the market. See Base Salary in this CD&A for details.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  A schedule reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to net income and non-GAAP EPS to net  income is available on page 40 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (a) minus interest income, (b) plus interest expense, depreciation and  amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, acquisition related expense, goodwill impairment and (c) excluding the tax expense or benefit.  
[END TABLE]
-22- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    EMIP: 2018 financial and strategic results did not meet threshold performance levels, which resulted in an overall  attainment percentage of 0%. See Annual Cash Incentives: The Executive Management Incentive Plan (EMIP) in this CD&A for details.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    LTIP: Under the LTIP, NEOs receive 50% of their annual grant in the form of performance-based restricted stock units  (PRSUs). Consistent with the terms of the LTIP, the NEOs earned 103.36% of their target PRSUs for the 2016-2018 performance cycle. This attainment is the combination of an average non-GAAP EPS target  attainment of 90.67% and a total shareholder return (TSR) multiplier of 114%. See Long Term Incentives  A Closer Look at Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) in this CD&A for details.   
[END TABLE]
These payouts are aligned with the Company's business performance in 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that the design and structure of the Company's incentive program provide a direct link between Company performance and pay outcomes for the executives, as described in greater detail in the following section. 
A Note About Onboarding Ms. Hlavinka: Ms. Hlavinka has more than 25 years of experience as a senior advisor and business executive with broad-based experience and legal background in the information technology, service, manufacturing and healthcare industries. To ensure that we could hire Ms. Hlavinka and to make up for compensation and equity being forfeited from her prior employer, the Committee provided a one-time, sign-on bonus of $650,000 to Ms. Hlavinka when she joined the Company on August 6, 2018. Pursuant to her new hire arrangement, Ms. Hlavinka will be required to pay back all or a portion of this sign on bonus if she voluntarily terminates from Itron within two years from her date of hire. She also received a one-time, equity grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) valued at $500,000. The RSUs vest one year from the anniversary date of the grant. These awards are one-time in nature and consistent with new hire arrangements for executives in similar roles. 
Linking CEO Pay and Performance 
A key component of our executive compensation philosophy is the link between compensation and overall business results and shareholder value creation. We strive to clearly communicate this to our shareholders and believe that looking at realizable pay in different contexts can illustrate this point effectively: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Realizable pay versus pay opportunity  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Realizable pay for performance relative to peers  
[END TABLE]
CEO Realizable Pay versus Pay Opportunity. Many of the required disclosures concerning CEO compensation discuss pay elements or opportunities that may be earned by the CEO. Realizable pay, on the other hand, more closely considers actual compensation earned (or earnable) based on performance. To illustrate the differences, we compared pay opportunity to realizable pay on a year-by-year basis over the past three years; for this purpose, we use the following definitions: 
Pay opportunity represents: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The sum of base salary and target EMIP opportunity for each fiscal year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The grant date fair value of stock options, RSUs and PRSUs granted in each fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
Realizable pay represents: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The sum of base salary and actual EMIP paid for each fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
-23- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The in the money value of any stock options granted in each fiscal year, valued as of their vesting date, or if  unvested, as of December 31, 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The value of RSUs granted in each fiscal year valued at their vesting date, or if unvested, as of December 31, 2018;

[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The number of PRSUs actually earned based on performance, valued as of December 31, 2018; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    For outstanding PRSUs (uncompleted performance cycles), the estimated number of PRSUs based on performance to date, valued  as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The chart below illustrates Mr. Mezey's realizable pay compared to his pay opportunity, as well as the corresponding year-end stock price for the last three years. 
CEO Realizable Pay for Performance Relative to Peer Group. To provide another perspective, it is also helpful to understand the degree of alignment between CEO realizable pay and performance relative to our peer companies. See "Our Decision Making Process – The Role of Peer Companies" in this CD&A for a list of the peer companies. To evaluate this alignment, we analyzed the relationship between realizable total direct compensation (TDC) for the CEO over 2015-2017 for the peer companies and for the Company, and TSR for the three years ended December 31, 2017. This time period was selected because it was most closely aligned with the compensation information available for our peer group companies for the years that Mr. Mezey has been our CEO. 
For this purpose, realizable TDC is defined as the sum of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Actual base salaries paid over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Actual annual incentives (bonuses) paid over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    In-the-money value as of  December 31, 2017 of any stock options granted over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The value as of December 31, 2017 of any restricted shares granted (including vested and unvested shares) over the  three-year period; and  
[END TABLE]
-24- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Cash-based long-term incentives awarded during the period, and the value as of December 31, 2017 of any performance  shares granted over the three-year period (assuming target performance for cycles not completed).  
[END TABLE]
The chart below illustrates the percentile ranking of our three-year TSR and Mr. Mezey's realizable TDC relative to our peer companies. As the chart indicates, during the three-year period our TSR performance was above the median of the peer companies and Mr. Mezey's realizable TDC was below the median. Mr. Mezey's realizable TDC was within an "alignment corridor" representing a strong correlation between compensation and performance.

2018 Say-On-Pay & Shareholder Engagement 
Each year, we carefully consider the results of our shareholder say-on-pay vote from the preceding year. We also take into account the feedback we receive from our major shareholders, which is solicited by the Board Chair, and the Chair of the Compensation Committee, either in person or via telephone. 
In 2018, approximately 95% of the votes cast supported our executive compensation decisions. Since 2012, the Board has regularly conducted proactive outreach meetings with the company's largest shareholders. During 2018, the Company offered meetings to shareholders representing 45% of shares outstanding, and directors met with shareholders representing 15% of shares outstanding to discuss topics including Company strategy and performance, governance, and executive compensation. Overall, our shareholders are highly supportive of our executive compensation program and its direction. Based on the positive feedback we received from our major shareholders, in addition to the vote result in 2018, we did not make substantive changes to the structure of our program. We will continue to keep an open dialogue with our shareholders to help ensure that we have a regular pulse on investor perspectives. 
What Guides Our Program 
Our Compensation Philosophy & Objectives 
The philosophy underlying our executive compensation program is to employ the best leaders in our industry to ensure we execute on our business goals, promote both short-and long-term profitable growth of the Company, and create long-term shareholder value, all grounded in the following guiding principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Pay for Performance   A significant portion of an executive's total compensation should be variable ("at risk") and dependent upon the attainment of certain specific and measurable annual and long-term business performance  objectives. 
 Shareholder Alignment   Executives should be compensated through pay elements (base salaries and annual- and long-term incentives) designed to align executive compensation to the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. 
 Competitiveness   Target compensation should be set at the median of market to ensure that compensation is at a level that is competitive with that being offered to individuals holding comparable positions at other companies with which we compete  for business and leadership talent. 
 Attraction and Retention   The executive compensation program should enable the Company to attract highly-talented people with exceptional leadership capabilities and retain high-caliber talent. When required, the Company may adjust individual elements of  compensation to accomplish this goal.

Pay Mix 
The charts below show the target annual TDC of our CEO and our other NEOs for fiscal 2018. These charts illustrate that a majority of NEO TDC is variable (85% for our CEO and an average of 76% for our other NEOs). 
Our Decision Making Process 
The Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee oversees the executive compensation program for our NEOs. The Committee is comprised of independent, non-employee members of the Board. The Committee works very closely with its independent consultant and management to examine the effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation program throughout the year. Details of the Committee's authority and responsibilities are specified in the Compensation Committee's charter, which may be accessed at our website, www.itron.com, by selecting "Investors," and then "Corporate Governance." 
The Committee makes all final compensation and equity award decisions regarding our NEOs, except for the CEO, whose compensation is determined by the independent members of the full Board, based upon recommendations of the Committee. 
The Role of Management 
Members of our management team attend regular meetings where executive compensation, Company and individual performance, and competitive compensation levels and practices are discussed and evaluated. Only the Committee members are allowed to vote on decisions regarding NEO compensation. 
The CEO reviews his recommendations pertaining to other executives (non-NEO) pay with the Committee providing transparency and oversight. Decisions on non-NEO pay are made by the CEO. The CEO does not participate in the deliberations of the Committee regarding his own compensation. Independent members of the Board make all final determinations regarding CEO compensation. 
The Role of the Independent Consultant 
The Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to provide expertise on competitive pay practices, program design, and an objective assessment of any inherent risks of any programs. Pursuant to authority granted to it under its charter, the Committee has hired F.W. Cook as its independent consultant. F.W. Cook reports directly to the Committee and does not provide any additional services to management. The Committee has conducted an independence assessment of F.W. Cook in accordance with SEC rules.

The Role of Peer Companies 
For some of our direct competitors who are not publicly held, or are smaller business units within a conglomerate, there is limited compensation information available. As a result, our peer companies for purposes of benchmarking executive compensation (Peer Companies) generally consist of direct competitors for which public information is available, who are part of the same broad Standard & Poor's (S&P) industry classifications of technology hardware and equipment or in software and services, and who are similar in size and scope of global operations as Itron. The Committee reviews the Peer Companies on an annual basis. 
For the purposes of setting 2018 compensation, the Committee conducted an in-depth assessment of potential comparators to evaluate the degree to which the current Peer Companies have kept pace with Itron's growth and evolution. The Committee also took into consideration the broader marketplace to identify appropriate and relevant additions and removals from the current Peer Companies considering the acquisition of Silver Spring Networks and other recent peer company developments. As a result of this review, and with the support of F.W. Cook, the following changes were made to the Peer Companies:

For each of the Peer Companies, data regarding base salaries, annual incentives, and long-term incentives was obtained from their annual proxy statements and reviewed by Pearl Meyer. This data was supplemented with survey data prepared by Radford Survey & Consulting (Radford Survey), which provides compensation market information on more than 700 technology companies, aggregated and presented anonymously. The Radford Survey data was narrowed to those technology companies with revenues between $1 billion and $3 billion, similar to Itron. 
With the support of F.W. Cook, the Committee evaluates this data for informational purposes when establishing a range of competitive compensation for our NEOs. For each NEO, the Committee determines the salary range, annual incentive target, and long-term incentive taking into consideration market data for the position being evaluated. However, market data is not the sole determinant of the Company's practices or executive compensation levels. The Committee also takes into account the experience, performance, responsibilities, and contributions to the Company by each NEO when making its decisions. For the CEO, the Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the independent members of the Board review and approve the CEO's compensation. 
The 2018 Executive Compensation Program in Detail 
Base Salary 
Base salary represents annual fixed compensation and is a standard element of compensation necessary to attract and retain executive leadership talent. In making base salary decisions, the Committee considers the CEO's recommendations, as well as each NEO's position and level of responsibility within the Company. The Committee takes into account factors such as relevant market data as well as individual performance and contributions. The Committee recommended approval of a base salary increase for the CEO, and the independent members of the Board approved the CEO annual base salary rate as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO      2017        2018% Increase 
 Philip C. Mezey*      $   800,000        $   $825,000        3%

Annual Cash Incentives: The Executive Management Incentive Plan (EMIP) 
The 2018 EMIP provided our NEOs the opportunity to earn a performance-based annual cash bonus. Actual bonus payouts depend on the achievement of pre-established performance objectives and can range from 0% to 180% of target award amounts. Target annual bonus opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary and were established by the NEO's level of responsibility and his or her ability to impact overall results. The Committee also considers market data in setting target award amounts. 2018 target award opportunities remained unchanged from 2017 target award opportunities and were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO      Target EMIP (as a% of Base Salary) 
 Philip C. Mezey      125% 
 Thomas L. Deitrich      100%

 Michel C. Cadieux      75% 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  *  Ms. Hlavinka's 2018 EMIP target award opportunity was set at 75% when she was hired on August 6, 2018.   
[END TABLE]
2018 Performance Objectives. An individual NEO's EMIP award is based on a combination of financial and strategic objectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Objectives     Performance Metrics & Weightings    EMIP Weighting 
 Financial (80%)       Total Company  Consolidated Revenue    40% 
      Total Company  Adjusted EBITDA*    40% 
 Strategic (20%)       Strategic  Goals    20% 
 Total         100% 
[END TABLE]
* If the threshold Adjusted EBITDA goal shown on the table below is not achieved, no portion of the EMIP award will be paid. 
In 2018, we used total Company consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA as the financial performance metrics in the EMIP because we believe it is important to focus on both top line growth (revenue), as well as profitability. Total Company Adjusted EBITDA provides a more useful illustration of our financial performance and the ongoing operations of our business, since the adjustments exclude certain expenses that are not indicative of our recurring core operating results. This facilitates better comparisons to our historical performance and our competitors' operating results. To continue our focus on profits and sales performance, the weighting of the financial performance objectives (which represent 80% of a NEO's EMIP award) for 2018 was 50% total Company Adjusted EBITDA and 50% total Company consolidated revenue. A schedule reconciling Adjusted EBITDA to net income and non-GAAP EPS to GAAP EPS is available on page 40 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Each year, the Committee reviews the financial performance and considers adjustments for items that are not reflective of normal operating performance for that year. These adjustments are items that the Committee believes are fair to both participants and shareholders, encourage appropriate actions that foster the long-term health of the business, and are consistent with the objectives underlying our predetermined performance goals. Such exclusions may consist of the costs and financial effects of restructuring, acquisitions and dispositions, selected legal costs and settlements, and the effects of foreign currency translation. No adjustments were made in 2018.

2018 Financial Performance Levels & Results. The following table shows the performance necessary to achieve threshold, target and maximum bonus payout amounts, along with actual results for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Note: Payouts are linearly interpolated for performance between threshold, target and maximum. 
* No portion of the EMIP was paid in 2018 because the threshold Adjusted EBITDA goal was not achieved. 
2018 Strategic Goals & Achievements. The strategic goals for the NEOs, as determined in consultation with the CEO and reviewed with the Committee, generally encompass objectives as they relate to both the individual business segments and the entire Company. For 2018, they were developed to continue to strengthen our operational results through objectives that align to predictability, profitability, and growth. 
Approved strategic goals included meeting return on invested capital targets, growth in Software and Services revenue and margin, cost of non-quality targets, improvement in predictability of quarterly financial results, and new business obtained by cross selling legacy Itron and Silver Spring Networks projects. The Company made progress across the strategic initiatives and achieved or partially achieved some of the strategic targets. Even though partial results were achieved for the strategic goals, no portion of the EMIP was paid in 2018 because the threshold Adjusted EBITDA goal was not achieved. 
Long-Term Incentives 
The NEOs are eligible for long-term incentives, all of which were issued under the terms of our Amended and Restated 2010 Plan. For fiscal year 2018, annual long-term incentives were granted as follows:

[END TABLE]
A Closer Look at Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs). The actual number of PRSUs that are earned and vested are based on the achievement of specific financial performance goals and relative TSR results. Specifically, actual awards are linked to a three-year performance period that consists of three annual performance cycles. The performance result used to determine the actual award earned is calculated at the end of the three-year performance period by averaging the results of the three annual performance cycles, then is adjusted based on performance relative to TSR as compared to the Russell 3000 Index. 
-33- 
2018 Performance Metrics: Non-GAAP EPS & Relative TSR. PRSUs are driven by the achievement of non-GAAP EPS and relative TSR performance targets. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Non-GAAP EPS: Non-GAAP EPS targets  are set by the Committee at the beginning of each annual performance cycle. Payout levels can range from 50% to 160% of target for the performance cycle. No PSRUs are earned for performance below the threshold. The following table shows the  thresholds, targets and maximums for non-GAAP EPS set by the Committee at the beginning of each annual performance cycle and our actual non-GAAP EPS results used for  calculating PRSUs earned for 2016, 2017 and 2018:    
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Note: The non-GAAP EPS results shown are based on financial results as reported for 2016, 2017, and 2018 (as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018). Performance for levels achieved between threshold, target, and maximum are linearly interpolated. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    Relative TSR: At the end of the three-year performance period, the non-GAAP  EPS results for each of the annual performance cycles are averaged. The average non-GAAP EPS is then adjusted based on the achievement by the Company of TSR relative to the Russell 3000 index for the same  three-year performance cycle as follows:    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 If relative TSR attainment is…     Then the average EPS attainment is… 
 At or below the 25th percentile    Adjusted down by 25% 
 At 50th percentile    No adjustment 
 At or above the 75th Percentile    Increased by 25% 
[END TABLE]
Note: Adjustments for levels achieved between the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are linearly interpolated. 
For the 2018 PRSUs, the TSR targets and point multipliers were all established in February 2018 by the Committee and by the independent members of the full Board for the CEO. 
PRSUs Earned and Vested In 2018 (1/1/2016 –12/31/2018). In 2016, the NEOs at that time were granted their target PRSUs with vesting based on achievement of the non-GAAP EPS and relative TSR performance targets for 2016, 2017, and 2018 as outlined above. The actual award earned was calculated at the end of the three-year performance period by averaging the results of the three annual performance cycles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year         Percentage   of Attainment 
 2016      160% 
 2017      112% 
 2018      0% 
 2016-2018 Average      90.67% 
[END TABLE]
-34- 
Consistent with the terms of the LTIP, the average performance attainment for the 2016-2018 PRSUs was then adjusted upward by 114% since our TSR was at the 64th percentile of the Russell 3000 index. As a result, the NEOs (other than those who were not employed at Itron in 2016) earned 103.36% of their target PRSUs for the 2016-2018 performance cycle, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO        Target PRSUs Granted           Actual PRSUs Earned 
 Philip C. Mezey       39,980          41,323 
 Thomas L. Deitrich       24,968          25,806 
 Michel C. Cadieux         9,987          10,322

Other Practices, Policies and Guidelines 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We believe that when our executives hold an equity interest in the Company, they will be less inclined to take excessive business risks. We maintain stock ownership guidelines to encourage our key executives to own stock at least equal in value to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO       6.0x 
 COO and CFO       3.0x 
 Senior Vice Presidents and General Counsel       2.0x 
[END TABLE]
Common stock, vested and unvested restricted shares, the net after-tax value of unexercised vested and unvested stock options, and stock held in the deferred compensation, 401(k) and the Employee Stock Purchase plans all count towards satisfaction of the guidelines. Additionally, participants are required to retain 50% of net profit shares from all stock acquired upon exercise or vesting unless the guideline level is achieved. Net profit shares are defined as the number of shares of stock acquired after payment of (i) in the case of options, any exercise price and tax withholding upon exercise, or (ii) in the case of restricted stock or restricted stock units, tax withholding upon vesting. We annually review the levels of stock ownership of our executives, and, based on a rolling 12-month average of our stock price as of the end of 2018, all of our NEOs have met the guidelines, with the exceptions of Ms. Hooper and Ms. Hlavinka who have both recently joined the Company and are making progress towards their goals. We also have stock ownership guidelines for the members of our Board. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
We prohibit the NEOs and other executives from engaging in transactions designed to insulate them from changes in the Company's stock price. Therefore, the Company has an Anti-Hedging Policy that prohibits our NEOs from entering into transactions that include (without limitation) equity swaps or short sales of our securities, margin accounts or pledges of our securities, and hedges or monetization transactions involving our securities that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Itron securities. In addition, the purchase or sale of puts, calls, options, or other derivative securities based on the Company's securities is prohibited under this policy, and borrowing against any account in which our securities are held is prohibited. 
-35- 
Change-in-Control Agreements 
We have entered into change-in-control agreements with our executives to encourage their full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of a change-in-control of the Company, and to provide them with reasonable compensation and benefits in the event of a change-in-control and a subsequent loss of employment. All equity awards granted have "double trigger" requirements before vesting upon a change-in-control. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES – Potential Payments upon Change-in-Control" in this CD&A for descriptions of the benefits provided under the change-in-control agreements. 
Employment Agreements; Severance Policy 
We do not have formal employment agreements with our executives. However, we do have an Executive Severance Policy for our executives that provides severance pay equal to one year's base salary, employer benefit premium payments or reimbursements for one year, and outplacement assistance provided there is a release of claims, non-disparagement, and confidentiality agreement with the executive. In addition, the executive must enter into a one-yearnon-compete agreement, where enforceable. 
In 2018, in connection with her role, Ms. Hlavinka became a participant under the Company's Executive Severance Policy and entered into indemnification agreements in the form customary for the Company's officers and directors. 
Incentive Repayment (Clawback) Policy 
Under our Incentive Repayment (Clawback) Policy, in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial results, the Compensation Committee, as designated by the Board, may review all cash or equity incentive awards that were based in whole or in part on the achievement of certain financial results. 
Where award(s) were predicated, in part or in whole, upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial restatement and, as determined by the Compensation Committee, the executive(s) engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement, the Compensation Committee will seek forfeiture or reimbursement to the Company of the award(s) from the executive(s) engaged in fraud in full, net of tax. If a material financial restatement was not due to fraud, the Compensation Committee may review the circumstances and, in its discretion to the extent practicable and allowable under applicable laws, determine to require forfeiture or reimbursement to the Company of the amount of the award(s) that exceeded the lower amount, payment or value that would have been made based on the restated financial results, net of tax. 
Any recoupment under this policy may be in addition to, and shall not otherwise limit, any other remedies that may be available to the Company under applicable law, including disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment. 
Executive Deferred Compensation 
Executives located in the U.S. are eligible to participate in our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP). We offer the EDCP to our highly-compensated employees to give them the benefit of being able to defer some of their taxable income, which also encourages their retention with the Company. Participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and annual cash incentive into a nonqualified account.

Executives are also permitted to elect to defer an additional portion of their base salary under the EDCP equal to the amount of any contributions returned to them during the year from the Company's 401(k) Plan. In 2018, the Company made matching contributions to the account of each participating executive at the rate of 75% of the first 6% of base salary and annual incentive deferred by the executive during that year, which is the same matching formula as the Company's 401(k) Plan. The employer match into the EDCP starts after the employee reaches IRS limits on the 401(k) Plan and is no longer eligible for the 401(k) match. The executives' account balances are adjusted for hypothetical investment earnings or losses according to the returns of the specified "measurement funds" selected by the executives. The measurement funds correspond to the mutual funds available for investment under the 401(k) Plan (but currently do not include a Company stock fund). 
See"EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES – 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" in this CD&A for more details. 
General Benefits and Perquisites 
Our NEOs receive the same benefits as our U.S. based salaried employees generally, including medical and dental benefits, group term life insurance, and short- and long-term disability protection. Itron also has relocation policies and benefits in place that may be applicable if an employee is required to move or has long term extended business travel to a new location. 
401(k) Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
Executives located in the U.S. are eligible to participate in our 401(k) Plan which provides our employees, including executives, with a 75% Company match on the first 6% of compensation deferred, subject to qualified plan limits. Similarly, executives located in the U.S. may participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, along with our other U.S. employees. 
We do not maintain any defined benefit or supplemental retirement programs for our NEOs. 
2018 Risk Assessment 
It is our belief that a majority of an executive's total compensation should be variable "at risk" compensation, meaning it is tied to the Company's financial performance. However, because performance-based incentives play a large role in our compensation program, we strive to ensure that incentives do not result in actions that may conflict with the long-term best interests of the Company and our shareholders. Therefore, the Committee evaluated all of our plans and policies (applicable to executives and employees below the executive level) in December 2018 for attributes that could cause excessive risk-taking. We concluded that our programs and policies do not encourage excessive risk-taking because: (a) the salary component of our program is a fixed amount; (b) the majority of the average compensation paid to our executive officers is delivered in the form of equity ownership, which aligns the interest of our executives with those of our shareholders; (c) executive officers are subject to our executive stock ownership guidelines; and (d) the annual cash-based incentive plan and long-term incentive plans are designed with risk-mitigating characteristics such as (i) maximum award payouts based on the attainment of various and continually evolving Company financial objectives which diversify risks associated with a single indicator of performance, (ii) our equity-based incentives encourage a longer-term focus through multi-year performance periods, (iii) our risk-mitigating policies in place such as insider trading and hedging prohibitions and clawbacks, and (iv) review and approval of final awards by our Committee (and the independent members of the full Board in the case of the CEO), which is composed entirely of independent directors who have discretion under our plans to approve, modify, or eliminate any award earned.

CEO Pay Ratio 
For 2018, the annual total compensation of our CEO was 90 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, based on annual total compensation of $4,971,887 for the CEO and $55,023 for the median employee. This calculation is based on employee population of 6,922 as of October 1, 2017. The median employee was identified using base pay, overtime pay, short-term incentives, and long-term incentive grant date fair values using data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. 
Our median employee was originally identified in 2017. In 2018, there was no change in Itron's employee population or employee compensation arrangements that the Company believes would significantly impact the Company's pay ratio disclosure. However, due to a change in our original median-compensated employee's circumstances in 2018, which the Company believes would no longer accurately reflect the compensation arrangements of its employees and result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure, the Company chose to replace our original median-compensated employee with an employee whose compensation in fiscal 2017 was substantially similar to our original median-compensated employee based on the compensation measure used to select our original median-compensated employee. 
Approximately 746 new employees were added to our employee population during 2018 as a result of the Silver Spring Networks acquisition. In accordance with SEC rules, these employees were not included in the consideration of the pay ratio calculation for 2018. 
Annual total compensation for both the CEO and the median employee was calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
Impact of Tax and Accounting 
We regularly consider the various tax and accounting implications of our compensation plans. When determining the amount of long-term incentives and equity grants to executives and employees, the compensation costs associated with the grants are reviewed, as required by FASB ASC Topic 718. 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally prohibits any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million in any taxable year to the CEO and the other "covered employees" as defined in the rule. Under the tax laws in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code was deductible without regard to this limitation. Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 generally eliminated the performance-based exemption, subject to a special rule that grandfathers certain awards and agreements that were in effect on November 2, 2017. While considering tax deductibility as only one of several considerations in determining compensation, the Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not compromise its ability to structure compensation programs that provide benefits to the Company that outweigh the potential benefit of a tax deduction and, therefore, may approve compensation that is not deductible for tax purposes.

Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with Itron's management. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's 2019 proxy statement.

  (1)  These columns reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of awards granted under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and  Second Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (2010 SIP) determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the  year ended December 31, 2018 regarding assumptions underlying the valuation of these equity awards.  
  (2)  Includes the grant date fair value of Performance RSUs (PRSUs) assuming target performance achievement. As the  performance-contingent awards are based on separate measurements of the Company's financial performance for each year in the three-year performance cycle, FASB ASC Topic 718 requires the grant date fair value to be calculated for the portion of  the award related to performance in each year. Therefore, the value includes one-third of the target PRSUs for each active three-year performance cycle. For more details on how performance is calculated, refer  to "A Closer Look at Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs)" in this CD&A.  
[END TABLE]
The grant date fair value of the performance related component is based upon the probable outcome for the award and is consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the performance period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718. As required under FASB ASC Topic 718, the full grant date fair value for the TSR multiplier for the entire three-year performance cycle is included in the amounts shown for the initial year of each performance cycle and was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model on the date the PRSUs were awarded. Grant date fair values assuming maximum performance achievement for the 2018 PRSUs for the full performance cycle (2018-2020) would be: P. Mezey - $3,789,347; T. Deitrich - $2,105,193; J. Hooper - $1,052,596; S. Hlavinka - $842,052; M. Cadieux - $842,077.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan 
Executives located in the U.S. are eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP). Under this plan, participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and 50% of their annual incentive bonus to a non-qualified account. Participants may also defer an additional portion of their base salary equal to the amount of any contributions returned to them during the year from the Company's 401(k) plan so that the 401(k) plan can satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements applicable to it. Annually, the Company makes matching contributions to the account of each participating executive at the rate of 75% of the first 6% of base salary and annual incentive deferred by the executive during that year. The employer match into the EDCP only commences after the employee reaches IRS limits on the 401(k) plan and is no longer eligible for the 401(k) match. 
Each participant's account is adjusted for hypothetical investment earnings or losses based on the performance of the "measurement funds" in which the account is deemed to be invested. Participants allocate their accounts among the measurement funds available under the plan and can change their allocation at any time. These measurement funds are the same as the mutual funds offered for investment purposes under the Company's 401(k) plan. Measurement funds are used solely to determine the amount of the hypothetical investment earnings or losses to be allocated to the participant's account. The Company is not obligated to invest any assets in these funds. 
Accounts are distributed (or commence to be distributed) to participants either based on pre-selected, in-service distribution dates or upon termination of employment with the Company and its affiliates. Distribution made after termination of employment will be made six months after termination to comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. 
A participant's account will be distributed in a lump sum, unless the participant elects to have it distributed in substantially equal annual installments over a period of not more than 10 years. This election must be made at the time the participant is first eligible to participate in the plan. 
-45- 
Potential Payments upon Termination 
The following describes certain actions and payments upon termination in accordance with Company policies and the provisions of our current Second A&R 2010 Plan, pursuant to which all of our equity awards are granted. 
Upon any termination of employment, our NEOs are entitled to receive any accrued and unpaid base salary through the date of termination. 
Termination for Cause 
The executive is entitled to receive any accrued and unpaid base salary through the date of termination. All options granted automatically expire when terminated for cause and all unvested time-vested RSUs and all unvested awards under the LTIP and the EMIP are forfeited in the event of termination for cause.

  (2)  Annual Incentive Plan: For awards under the EMIP, participants would receive a prorated award (assuming an award is  earned) based on the number of calendar days employed during the performance period and such payout, if any, will be made at the same time as the other participants.  
  (3)  Time-vested RSUs: If termination is due to retirement, any unvested RSUs granted in 2016 or prior would immediately  be forfeited. However, for the awards granted in fiscal 2017, if a retirement occurs following the second anniversary of the grant date, RSUs will continue to vest subject to  non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards granted in fiscal 2018, if a retirement occurs after 18 months following the grant date, RSUs  will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. If termination is due to death or disability (as defined in the Second  A&R 2010 Plan), any unvested RSUs will vest immediately.  
  (4)  Stock Options: Upon retirement, all unvested options automatically expire. Vested options granted in 2016 or prior  would remain exercisable until the earlier of three years following retirement or the option expiration date. However, for the awards granted in fiscal 2017, if a retirement occurs following the second anniversary of the grant date, options will  continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards granted in fiscal 2018, if a retirement occurs after 18 months  following the grant date, options will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. If termination is due to death or  disability, all unvested options become exercisable and remain exercisable until the earlier of one year following the date of death or disability, or the date on which the options expire by their terms.  
  (5)  Performance-Based RSUs (PRSUs): If termination occurs due to death or disability during the performance period, for  the awards granted in fiscal 2016 awards will be pro-rated based on days employed during the performance period and will be vested based on actual performance at the conclusion of the performance period.  However, for the awards granted in fiscal 2017 and 2018, shares will be awarded and settled based on the performance period and results ending in the year of death or disability, and will not be pro-rated for  partial employment during the performance period. If termination occurs due to retirement, for the awards granted in fiscal 2016 awards will be vested at actual performance and applied TSR multiplier after then end of the performance period, and pro-rated based on the number of calendar days between the beginning of the performance period and the date of retirement. However, for the awards granted in fiscal 2017, if a retirement occurs following the second  anniversary of the grant date, awards will vest in full based on actual performance and the applied TSR multiplier calculated at the end of the performance period, subject to  non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards granted in fiscal 2018, if a retirement occurs after 18 months following the grant date,  awards will vest in full based on actual performance and the applied TSR multiplier calculated at the end of the performance period, subject to non-compete/non-solicit  and reasonable notice restrictions. Vested units generally will be settled at the original vesting date set forth in the award agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.

Second A&R 2010 Plan Change-in-Control Provisions 
Our Second A&R 2010 Plan provides that in the event of a change-in-control, as defined in our change-in-control agreements described above, unless otherwise provided in the award agreement, generally awards will be assumed or substituted for by the surviving corporation, and will accelerate only if not so assumed or substituted. The vesting and payout of PRSUs will be governed by the award agreement, as described below. 
Performance-Based (PRSU) Change-in-Control Provisions 
If a change-in-control occurs during the following performance periods; (2016-2018) under the 2016 grant, (2017-2019) under the 2017 grant, or (2018-2020) under the 2018 grant, the PRSU awards will be vested at the greater of target or actual performance for the year, and pro-rated based on the number of calendar days between the beginning of the performance period and the change-in-control (i) in the event the awards are not assumed by the acquiring entity, or (ii) the beginning of the performance period and the date of termination of employment in the event the awards are assumed by the acquiring entity. 
Executive Officer Severance Policy 
The Company recognizes that it is usually difficult for executive officers whose employment is terminated involuntarily to obtain a position comparable to the one he or she has with the Company. In view of this, any executive officer who is terminated involuntarily, except if terminated for disciplinary reasons, will be entitled to receive severance pay equal to one year's base salary, employer benefit premium payments/reimbursement for one year and outplacement assistance provided that (1) the executive releases all claims that he or she may have against the Company, (2) enters into a one year non-compete agreement (where enforceable), (3) agrees not to solicit employees for a period of one year, and (4) agrees not to disparage the Company.

Termination Payment Tables for NEOs 
The tables below reflect the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of our NEOs in the event of termination of employment or change-in-control. The tables do not include benefits generally available to all employees on a non-discriminatory basis or payments and benefits that the NEOs would have already earned during their employment with us, whether or not a termination or change-in-control event had occurred. The amounts shown assume that such termination or change-in-control was effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive's termination or upon a change-in-control, as applicable.

  (1)   The above table does not include amounts under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, stock option awards that are  fully vested, earned salary, and accrued vacation as those items are earned and due to the employee regardless of such termination or change-in-control events. It also  does not include amounts payable under life insurance coverage, our accidental death & dismemberment coverage or our business travel accident coverage, which are programs available to all employees. Under the  change-in-control agreement with this executive the term is 24 months following a  change-in-control and the severance payment is equal to 2.5 times the sum of the executive's base salary and target annual bonus. Each form of payment is mutually  exclusive based on the individual circumstances or events and therefore represents a single payment and should not be added together.  
  (2)   Pursuant to our change-in-control  agreement with this executive, the annual bonus payable in the event of termination following a change-in-control is the greater of target or the actual amount earned.  The annual incentive plan did not pay out in 2018, so the value represents the target bonus opportunity.  
  (3)   Represents in-the-money value of  accelerated stock options based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29). For the awards in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, stock options will  continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18  months from the grant date, stock options will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed  forfeited, as retirement at December 31, 2018 is before the second anniversary and 18 months from the grant date, respectively. Upon a change-in-control, stock  options will accelerate only if they are not assumed or substituted, and otherwise provide for a double trigger; values presume that the acquirer assumes outstanding stock options.  
  (4)   Effective April 29, 2014, the Executive Officer Severance Pay Policy provides an executive officer, who is terminated  involuntarily, a severance payment equal to 1 times base salary plus one year of continued benefits and outplacement. The change-in-control agreements provide for a  severance payment equal to 2.5 times the sum of base salary and target annual bonus.  
  (5)   For the time-vested RSUs, upon termination due to death or disability, represents the accelerated value of the RSUs based  on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29). For the awards in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, RSUs will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18 months from the grant date, RSUs will  continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed forfeited, as retirement at December 31,  2018 is before the second and 18 months from the grant date, respectively. Upon a change-in-control only (single trigger), RSUs that are not assumed by an acquirer will  accelerate; values presume that the acquirer assumes applicable outstanding RSUs.  
[END TABLE]
-51- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (6)   Upon a termination due to death or disability, awards will vest based on actual performance at the conclusion of the  performance periods. For the awards granted in 2016, awards will vest on a pro-rated basis based on the number of days employed during the performance period. For the awards granted in fiscal 2017 and fiscal  2018, shares continue to vest through the year of death and disability and all unvested shares are accelerated. Fiscal 2017 values assume target performance will be achieved, while fiscal 2018 values assume threshold performance will be achieved.  For the awards granted in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, awards will vest in full based on actual performance at the end of the performance period (no  pro-rated payout). For the awards granted in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18 months from the grant date, awards will vest in full based on actual performance at the end of the  performance period (no pro-rated payout). 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed forfeited, as retirement at December 31, 2018 is before the second anniversary and 18 months from the grant date, respectively.  Pursuant to our award agreements with this executive the PRSUs outstanding as of the change-in-control will be vested at the greater of target or actual performance for  the year, and pro-rated based on the number of calendar days between the beginning of the performance period and the  change-in-control. Upon a change-in-control only (single trigger), PRSUs that are not  assumed by an acquirer will accelerate; values presume that the acquirer assumes applicable outstanding PRSUs. As of December 31, 2018, two three-year performance cycles (2017-2019 and 2018-2020) are not yet complete and target payouts are  used. For the 2016-2018 performance cycle, actual payouts were greater than target. Upon a termination following a change-in-control, value represents the incremental  difference in values between target and actual performance (e.g. no value for cycles where actual payouts are greater than or equal to target amounts). Values are based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29).

  (3)   Represents in-the-money value of  accelerated stock options based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29). For the awards in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, stock options will  continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18  months from the grant date, stock options will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed  forfeited, as retirement at December 31, 2018 is before the second anniversary and 18 months from the grant date, respectively. Upon a change-in-control, stock  options will accelerate only if they are not assumed or substituted, and otherwise provide for a double trigger; values presume that the acquirer assumes outstanding stock options.

The change-in-control agreements provide for a  severance payment equal to 2.5 times the sum of base salary and target annual bonus.  
  (5)   For the time-vested RSUs, upon termination due to death or disability, represents the accelerated value of the RSUs based  on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29). For the awards in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, RSUs will continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. For the awards in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18 months from the grant date, RSUs will  continue to vest subject to non-compete/non-solicit and reasonable notice restrictions. 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed forfeited, as retirement at December 31,  2018 is before the second and 18 months from the grant date, respectively. Upon a change-in-control only (single trigger), RSUs that are not assumed by an acquirer will  accelerate; values presume that the acquirer assumes applicable outstanding RSUs.  
  (6)   Upon a termination due to death or disability, awards will vest based on actual performance at the conclusion of the  performance periods. For the awards granted in 2016, awards will vest on a pro-rated basis based on the number of days employed during the performance period. For the awards granted in fiscal 2017 and fiscal  2018, shares continue to vest through the year of death and disability and all unvested shares are accelerated. Fiscal 2017 values assume target performance will be achieved, while fiscal 2018 values assume threshold performance will be achieved.  For the awards granted in fiscal 2017, upon a termination due to retirement after the second anniversary of the grant date, awards will vest in full based on actual performance at the end of the performance period (no  pro-rated payout). For the awards granted in fiscal 2018, upon a termination due to retirement after 18 months from the grant date, awards will vest in full based on actual performance at the end of the  performance period (no pro-rated payout). 2017 and 2018 awards are assumed forfeited, as retirement at December 31, 2018 is before the second anniversary and 18 months from the grant date, respectively.  Pursuant to our award agreements with this executive the PRSUs outstanding as of the change-in-control will be vested at the greater of target or actual performance for  the year, and pro-rated based on the number of calendar days between the beginning of the performance period and the  change-in-control. Upon a change-in-control only (single trigger), PRSUs that are not  assumed by an acquirer will accelerate; values presume that the acquirer assumes applicable outstanding PRSUs. As of December 31, 2018, two three-year performance cycles (2017-2019 and 2018-2020) are not yet complete and target payouts are  used. For the 2016-2018 performance cycle, actual payouts were greater than target. Upon a termination following a change-in-control, value represents the incremental  difference in values between target and actual performance (e.g. no value for cycles where actual payouts are greater than or equal to target amounts). Values are based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($47.29).

PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT 
The Board, upon the recommendation of its Audit/Finance Committee, has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accountant for the 2019 fiscal year, subject to ratification by our shareholders. Although not required to do so, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP for ratification by the Company's shareholders for their views on the Company's independent registered public accountant and as a matter of good corporate practice. Deloitte & Touche LLP has advised the Company that it has no direct, nor any material indirect, financial interest in the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In the event that our shareholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered as a direction to the Board and the Audit/Finance Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit/Finance Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm, subject to ratification by the Board, at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
Directors and Executive Officers 
The following table provides information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 1, 2019 by each of our directors, each of our executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, and all of our director nominees, directors, and executive officers as a group. The percentage ownership data is based on 39,854,779 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 1, 2019. Under SEC rules, beneficial ownership includes shares over that which the indicated beneficial owner exercises voting and/or investment power. Shares of common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days or shares of restricted stock units vested or that will vest within 60 days are deemed outstanding for computing the number of shares and the percentage ownership of the person holding the option, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as otherwise noted, we believe that the beneficial owners of the shares of common stock listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares beneficially owned, subject to applicable community property laws.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. SEC regulations require our officers, directors, and greater than 10% shareholders to provide us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on our review of these forms and written representations received from certain reporting persons, we believe that, except as stated in the paragraph below, during 2018 all of our executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% shareholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them. 
The Company inadvertently failed to timely report a grant by the Company to Joan S. Hooper, the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer made on February 22, 2018 of 3,607 shares of common stock and 10,058 options for common stock, both subject to a three-year vesting schedule. The grant of the award was subsequently reported on a Form 4 that was filed on December 17, 2018.

In addition, shareholders who wish to submit nominations for the election of directors or proposals that will not be included in our proxy materials must do so in accordance with the advance notice provisions and other applicable requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws.
