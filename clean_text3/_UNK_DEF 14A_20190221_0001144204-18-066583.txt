PROXY STATEMENT 
​
Annual Meeting of Stockholders to Be Held on Thursday, February 21, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of KushCo Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "we") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held on Thursday, February 21, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time at the Center Club Orange County, 650 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, California 92626, and any adjournments or postponements thereof. You may obtain directions to the Annual Meeting at www.proxyvote.com. At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders of the Company will be asked to consider and vote upon: 
1.
The election of the director nominees, nominated by the board of directors, for a one-year term, such term to continue until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 or until such directors' successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal; 
​
2.
The ratification of the appointment of RBSM LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019; 
​
3.
The approval of an amendment to the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by 3,000,000 shares; and 
​
4.
Such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
​
Under rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each stockholder of record or beneficial owner of our common stock, we are now furnishing proxy materials, which include our Proxy Statement and Annual Report, to our stockholders over the Internet and providing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is first being mailed to stockholders of the Company on or about December 31, 2018, in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting. The board of directors has fixed the close of business on December 24, 2018 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"). Only holders of record of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 80,207,266 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were approximately 160 stockholders of record. Each holder of a share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record with respect to each matter properly submitted at the Annual Meeting. 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Shares held of record by stockholders or their nominees who do not return a signed and dated proxy, properly deliver proxies via the Internet or telephone, or attend the Annual Meeting in person will not be considered present or represented at the Annual Meeting and will not be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. Consistent with applicable law, we intend to count abstentions and broker non-votes only for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. A broker "non-vote" refers to shares held by a broker or nominee that does not have the authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter. Applicable rules no longer permit brokers to vote in the election of directors if the broker has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Accordingly, it is important that beneficial owners instruct their brokers how they wish to vote their shares. TABLE OF CONTENTS
With respect to the election of directors in Proposal 1, such directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast if a quorum is present. Votes may be cast for the directors or withheld. In a plurality election, votes may only be cast in favor of or withheld from the nominee; votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect. This means that the persons receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes will be elected as a director. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will have no impact on the election of directors, except to the extent that the failure to vote for an individual results in another individual receiving a larger percentage of votes. 
Approval of Proposal No. 2 regarding the ratification of RBSM LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will have no impact on this Proposal No. 2. 
Approval of Proposal No. 3 regarding the amendment to the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder by 3,000,000 shares requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will have no impact on this Proposal No. 3. 
The corporate actions described in this Proxy Statement will not afford stockholders the opportunity to dissent from the actions described herein or to receive an agreed or judicially appraised value for their shares. 
You will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request to receive these materials in hard copy by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will instruct you how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you how you may submit your proxy via the Internet or mail. To the extent you receive a proxy card, such proxy card will also contain instructions on how you may also vote by telephone. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
We encourage you to vote either online, by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning a proxy card or if you hold your shares through a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution, by completing and returning a voting instruction form. This ensures that your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting and reduces the likelihood that we will be forced to incur additional expenses soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting.
Voting over the Internet, by telephone or mailing a proxy card will not limit your right to vote in person or to attend the Annual Meeting. Any record holder as of the Record Date may attend the Annual Meeting in person and may revoke a previously provided proxy at any time by: (i) executing and delivering a later-dated proxy to the corporate secretary at KushCo Holdings, Inc., 11958 Monarch Street, Garden Grove, CA 92841; (ii) delivering a written revocation to the corporate secretary at the address above before the meeting; or (iii) voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial holders who wish to change or revoke their voting instructions should contact their brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution for information on how to do so. Beneficial holders who wish to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person should contact their brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution holding shares of Common Stock on their behalf in order to obtain a "legal proxy", which will allow them to vote in person at the meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. 
Our board of directors recommends an affirmative vote on all proposals specified in the notice for the Annual Meeting. Proxies will be voted as specified. If your proxy is properly submitted, it will be voted in the manner you direct. If you do not specify instructions with respect to any particular matter to be acted upon at the meeting, proxies will be voted in favor of the board of directors' recommendations. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting to be Held on Thursday, February 21, 2019: The Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, are available at www.proxyvote.com. The Annual Report, however, is not part of the proxy solicitation material. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

INFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our board of directors held eight meetings. Each of the directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the board of directors. The board of directors encourages directors to attend in person the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, or Special Meeting in lieu thereof, or, if unable to attend in person, to participate by other means, if practicable. In recognition of this policy, the board of directors typically schedules a regular meeting of the board of directors to be held on the date of, and immediately following, the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Our board of directors does not have a lead independent director and does not believe that one is currently necessary. The non-employee directors meet regularly in executive sessions outside the presence of management. Mr. Kovacevich, our Chief Executive Officer, has served as the Chairman of the board of directors since November 2017. Among other things, the non-employee directors provide feedback to the Chief Executive Officer on executive sessions and facilitates discussion among the independent directors outside of meetings of the board of directors. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management of our Company and the development and implementation of our Company's strategy. 
Our board of directors believes that the current board leadership structure, in which the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by one person, is appropriate for us and our stockholders at this time. The current board leadership structure is believed to be appropriate because it demonstrates to our employees, suppliers, customers, and other stockholders that we are under strong leadership, with a single person setting the tone and having primary responsibility for managing our operations. The board will continue to reexamine our corporate governance policies and leadership structure on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet our needs. We will review these policies and may adopt a different approach in the future if circumstances warrant a change. 
Independent Directors 
Our board of directors is currently composed of five members. Of those five members, Mr. Baum, Mr. Hunter and Ms. Goodstein qualify as independent directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.

Our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of the company's risk management processes and regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our business and the steps we take to manage them. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management to enable our board to understand the company's risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risk. 
The board of directors reviews information regarding liquidity and operations, and oversees our management of financial risks. Periodically, the board of directors reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management, loss prevention and regulatory compliance. Oversight by the board of directors includes direct communication with our external auditors, and discussions with management regarding significant risk exposures and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. The board of directors is responsible for assessing whether any of our compensation policies or programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The board of directors also manages risks associated with the independence of the board, corporate disclosure practices, and potential conflicts of interest. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Corporate Governance and Code of Ethics 
We believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder. Our board of directors continue to evaluate our corporate governance principles and policies. 
Our board of directors have adopted a code of business conduct that applies to each of our directors, officers and employees. The code addresses various topics, including: 
 compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; 
​
 conflicts of interest; 
​
 public disclosure of information; 
​
 insider trading; 
​
 corporate opportunities; 
​
 competition and fair dealing; 
​
 discrimination, harassment and retaliation; 
​
 record-keeping; 
​
 confidentiality; 
​
 protection and proper use of company assets; and 
​
 reporting illegal and unethical behavior. 
​
The code of business conduct is posted on our website. Any waiver of the code of business conduct for an executive officer or director may be granted only by our board of directors and must be timely disclosed as required by applicable law. Any concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters reported under these procedures will be communicated promptly to the audit committee. 
Board Committees 
On March 9, 2018, our board of directors established an audit committee, a compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which operate under a charter that has been approved by our board. The directors serving as members of these committees meet the criteria for independence under, and the functioning of these committees complies with, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules and regulations. In addition, we believe that the functioning of these committees complies with the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Each committee has the composition and responsibilities described below. 
Audit Committee 
Our board of directors has established an audit committee, which is comprised of Eric Baum, Barbara Goodstein and Donald Hunter, each of whom is a non-employee member of the board of directors. Donald Hunter serves as the chair of the audit committee. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the audit committee met two times. Prior to March 2018, the entire board of directors performed the functions of an audit committee. The audit committee's main function is to oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes, internal systems of control, independent registered public accounting firm relationships and the audits of our financial statements. Pursuant to the audit committee charter, the functions of the committee include, among other things: 
 appointing, approving the compensation of and assessing the independence of our registered public accounting firm; 
​
 overseeing the work of our registered public accounting firm; 
​
 reviewing and discussing with management and the registered public accounting firm our annual and quarterly financial statements and related disclosures; 
​

In addition, our board of directors has also determined that Mr. Hunter has the requisite financial sophistication under the applicable rules and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. 
Compensation Committee 
Our board of directors has established a compensation committee, which is comprised of Eric Baum, Barbara Goodstein and Donald Hunter. Eric Baum serves as the chair of the compensation committee. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the compensation committee met one time. Prior to March 2018, compensation of our executive officers and directors, including, but not limited to, the grant of awards pursuant to our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2016 Plan"), was decided by the board of directors as a whole. Our compensation committee reviews and recommends policies relating to compensation and benefits of our officers and employees. Pursuant to the compensation committee charter, the functions of this committee include: 
 reviewing our compensation and benefits policies generally, including reviewing, approving and administering any incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans; 
​
 in coordination with our other independent directors, reviewing and approving the compensation of our chief executive officer and determining the chief executive officer's salary and contingent compensation based on performance and other relevant criteria;

​
 if and as applicable, furnishing the annual compensation committee report required by SEC rules; and 
​
 reviewing and assessing any risks arising from our compensation policies and practices. 
​
Our board of directors has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee is a "non-employee director" as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and is an "outside director" as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees of the Compensation Committee or its chair, including the authority to make grants and awards of stock rights or options to any of our non-executive officers. The Compensation Committee may also delegate its authority relating to the compensation practices for employees other than executive officers and directors, and to matters that the Compensation Committee deems ministerial.

The options are governed by the terms and conditions of a stock option agreement which Mr. McCormick signed, which terms and conditions reflect the foregoing and provide for vesting upon a change of control of the Company.

On August 29, 2014, Ben Wu was appointed by the board of directors to serve as Chief Operating Officer and Nicholas Kovacevich was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Under Mr. Wu's employment agreement, he was entitled to receive compensation of  $96,000 per year as a base salary and a discretionary annual cash bonus not to exceed his base salary, with the amount of such bonus, if any, determined by the board of directors.

The option fully vested upon execution of Mr. Wu's employment agreement and was exercisable immediately. Effective September 1, 2015, Mr. Wu's salary increased to $130,000 per annum and Mr. Wu received a $16,000 bonus. 
Change of Control 
Certain of our former named executive officers were eligible to receive certain benefits in the event of a change in control or if their employment was terminated under certain circumstances, as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Equity Compensation 
We grant stock options and restricted shares to our named executive officers as the long-term incentive component of our compensation program. Stock options allow employees to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant and may or may not be intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" for United States federal income tax purposes. Generally, one-half of the equity awards we grant vest on the first year anniversary, with the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over 12 months, subject to the employee's continued employment with us on the vesting date.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Ben Wu 
The employment agreement we entered into with Ben Wu, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, included severance provisions. In the event of any of the following conditions triggering severance payment was effected as of or after six months of Mr. Wu's employment commencement date, Mr. Wu would have been entitled to receive an amount equal to three months of base salary, or $32,500. 
Mr. Wu would have been entitled to such amount if  (i) his employment is terminated by us (A) without Cause, (B) by delivery of a non-renewal notice by us, (C) by reason of his death or disability, or (D) if his title or duties were materially modified, we changed our primary place of business or the location at which Mr. Wu was expected to be by more than 50 miles, we materially breached a material provision of the employment agreement or we otherwise materially and adversely changed the conditions of employment; or (ii) (A) a Change of Control is consummated, (B) Mr. Wu was not offered substantially equivalent employment with the surviving company following the Change of Control and (C) Mr. Wu resigned or otherwise voluntarily failed to continue employment with the Company or the surviving company following such Change of Control.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
"Cause" means (i) conviction of a felony, (ii) commission of an act of fraud or embezzlement against us, (iii) willful disregard of a written directive of the board of directors involving a matter of material importance to us and that is uncured 30 days after receiving notice, (iv) a material breach of any material provision of the employment agreement, (v) engaging in conduct which is intended to bring disrepute or to damage the reputation and operation of us, (vi) unexcused repeated absenteeism or (vii) use of illegal substances that significantly impairs an officer's ability to perform his duties. 
"Change of Control" means any of the following: any consolidation, merger, or recapitalization of us with, or any sale of our equity to, any other non-affiliated entity as a result of which, in any such case, the beneficial holders of our issued and outstanding equity securities immediately prior to such transaction possess less than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity immediately after such transaction; or any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets. 
On the date of Mr. Wu's resignation, we entered into a Separation Agreement with Mr. Wu. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, among other things, (a) Mr. Wu will receive a severance payment of  $30,000, which will be payable in three monthly installments following the date of Mr. Wu's resignation, (b) we amended the terms of fully vested options held by Mr. Wu to purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to (i) extend the exercise period with respect to such options until the one-year anniversary of Mr. Wu's resignation, subject to certain monthly limitations and (ii) provide that upon a change of control of us, all such options will become immediately vested and exercisable, and (c) Mr. Wu received 100,000 restricted shares of our common stock, which will vest fully on the earlier to occur of  (i) the one-year anniversary of Mr. Wu's resignation or (ii) a change of control of us.

Mr. Wu forfeited unvested options to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon his resignation, in accordance with the applicable option grant agreement. 
Other than the agreements with Ben Wu described in the preceding paragraphs, we are not a party to any contract, agreement, plan, or arrangement, whether written or unwritten, that provides for a payment or payments to a named executive officer at, following, or in connection with the resignation, retirement, or other termination of employment of the named executive officer, or a change in control, or a change in the officer's responsibilities following a change in control.

Limitations of Liability and Indemnification Matters 
We are a Nevada corporation and generally governed by the Nevada Private Corporations Code, Title 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, or NRS. 
Section 78.138 of the NRS provides that, unless the corporation's articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director or officer will not be individually liable unless it is proven that (i) the director's or officer's acts or omissions constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties, and (ii) such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law. 
Section 78.7502 of the NRS permits a company to indemnify its directors and officers against expenses, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, if the officer or director (i) is not liable pursuant to Section 78.138 of the NRS, or (ii) acted in good faith and in a manner the officer or director reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, if a criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of the officer or director was unlawful. Section 78.7502 of the NRS also precludes indemnification by the corporation if the officer or director has been adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, after exhaustion of all appeals, to be liable to the corporation or for amounts paid in settlement to the corporation, unless and only to the extent that the court determines that in view of all the circumstances, the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and requires a corporation to indemnify its officers and directors if they have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any claim, issue, or matter resulting from their service as a director or officer. 
Section 78.751 of the NRS permits a Nevada corporation to indemnify its officers and directors against expenses incurred by them in defending a civil or criminal action, suit, or proceeding as they are incurred and in advance of final disposition thereof, upon determination by the stockholders, the disinterested board members, or by independent legal counsel. Section 78.751 of the NRS provides that the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or an agreement may require a corporation to advance expenses as  TABLE OF CONTENTS
incurred upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the officer or director to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such officer or director is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation if so provided in the corporation's articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other agreement. Section 78.751 of the NRS further permits the corporation to grant its directors and officers additional rights of indemnification under its articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other agreement. 
Section 78.752 of the NRS provides that a Nevada corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another company, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, for any liability asserted against him and liability and expenses incurred by him in his capacity as a director, officer, employee, or agent, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation has the authority to indemnify him against such liability and expenses. We have obtained insurance policies insuring our directors and officers against certain liabilities they may incur in their capacity as directors and officers. Under such policies, the insurer, on our behalf, may also pay amounts for which we have granted indemnification to the directors or officers. 
The foregoing discussion of indemnification merely summarizes certain aspects of indemnification provisions and is limited by reference to the above discussed sections of the NRS. 
Our bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers and may indemnify our employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by the NRS. 
The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. A stockholder's investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
We use a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our board of directors. In setting director compensation, the board of directors and the compensation committee consider the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill-level required by the Company of members of the board of directors. 
On July 31, 2018, our board of directors approved new compensation arrangements for non-employee Directors. Each Director that is not an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries is entitled to receive the following cash compensation for board services, as applicable: 
 $30,000 per year for service as a board of directors member; 
​
 $15,000 per year for service as chairman of the audit committee; 
​
 $10,000 per year for service as chairman of the compensation committee; 
​
 $5,000 per year for service as chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee; 
​
 $7,500 per year for service as non-chairman member of the audit committee; 
​
 $5,000 per year for service as non-chairman member of the compensation committee; and 
​
 $2,500 per year for service as non-chairman member of the nominating and corporate governance committee. 
​
Each new independent non-employee member that is elected to the board of directors will receive an automatic grant of restricted shares of our common stock under the 2016 Plan, with the number of such shares to be determined by the compensation committee. The restricted shares will be granted following the new director's initial election to the board of directors and the restrictions will vest with respect to one-third of the shares on the first anniversary of the applicable grant date and ratably in monthly installments over the following 24 months. For purposes of such initial grants, an independent non-employee director is a director who is not employed by us and who does not receive compensation from us (excluding non-employee director compensation) or have a business relationship with us that would require disclosure under applicable SEC rules, and who has been determined to be independent by our board of directors. 
On the first day of each fiscal year, each non-employee director is eligible to receive a non-qualified stock option to purchase 145,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Annual grants vest with respect to 50% of the underlying shares on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining underlying shares vesting in 12 equal monthly installments. 
Also on July 31, 2018, our board of directors approved one-time grants to each non-employee director as of such date 30,000 shares of restricted stock, with the restrictions vesting with respect to one-third of the restricted shares on the one-year anniversary of the grant date and the remainder of the restrictions vesting in 24 equal monthly installments. 
Upon the appointment of Donald Hunter to our board of directors on February 1, 2018, our board of directors approved a one-time grant of options to Mr. Hunter to purchase 120,000 shares of our common stock, with the exercise price being equal to the fair market value per share of our common stock as of the grant date. One-half of the shares underlying the options will vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder of the underlying shares will vest in twelve equal monthly installments. 
We do not compensate Mr. Kovacevich for his services in his capacity as Chairman. Directors are not paid for meetings attended. All travel and lodging expenses associated with corporate matters are reimbursed by us, if and when incurred. TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Transactions with Related Persons 
Except as set out below, since September 1, 2017, there have been no transactions, or currently proposed transactions, in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds the lesser of  $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, or an affiliate or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation, termination and change-in-control arrangements, which are described under "Executive Compensation." We also describe below certain other transactions with our directors, executive officers and stockholders. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. 
All of the transactions set forth below were approved by a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors. We believe that we have executed all of the transactions set forth below on terms no less favorable to us than we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention to ensure that all future transactions between us and our officers, directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates are approved by a majority of the members of our board of directors, including a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors, and are on terms no less favorable to us than those that we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties. 
Sub-Lease 
We sub-leased our former corporate headquarters from 3 Kings Ventures, LLC, a related party owned by Dallas Imbimbo, Director, Nicholas Kovacevich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeffrey Meng, formerly a greater than 5% stockholder. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we made rent payments to 3 Kings Ventures, LLC of  $110,000. 
Director Independence 
Our board of directors is currently composed of five members, of whom three, Eric Baum, Barbara Goodstein and Donald Hunter, are independent. Our common stock is not currently listed for trading on a national securities exchange and, as such, we are not subject to any director independence standards. We evaluated independence in accordance with the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Mr. Baum, Ms. Goodstein and Mr. Hunter qualify as an independent committee member under the independence standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC applicable to audit, compensation, or nominating and corporate governance committees generally.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company's common stock (collectively, "Reporting Persons") to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Reporting Persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of such reports received or written representations from certain Reporting Persons during fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we believe that all Reporting Persons complied with all applicable reporting requirements, except that due to administrative error, Messrs. Imbimbo, Baum, McCormick and Kovacevich filed late Form 4s on November 17, 2018 relating to stock options granted on November 14, 2018 and due to a delay in obtaining filing codes, Ms. Goodstein filed a late Form 4 on November 21, 2018 relating to stock options granted on November 14, 2018. 
EXPENSES OF SOLICITATION 
We will pay the entire expense of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. In addition to solicitations by mail, certain of our directors, officers and employees (who will receive no compensation for their services other than their regular compensation) may solicit proxies by telephone, telegram, personal interview, facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic communication. Banks, brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries have been requested to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock held of record by them as of the Record Date, and such custodians will be reimbursed for their expenses.

SUBMISSION OF SECURITYHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIRECTOR CANDIDATES 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies and evaluates director candidates and recommends candidates to our board of directors for nomination. The process followed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to identify and evaluate director candidates includes requests to current directors and others for recommendations, meetings to evaluate potential candidates and interviews of selected candidates. We do not pay any fees to third parties to identify or evaluate potential nominees. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate all such proposed director candidates, including those recommended by securityholders in compliance with the procedures established by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in the same manner, with no regard to the source of the initial recommendation of such proposed director candidate. When considering a potential candidate for membership on the board of directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the minimum qualifications and other criteria for board membership approved by the board of directors, all facts and circumstances that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, the skills of the proposed director candidate, his or her availability, depth and breadth of business experience or other background characteristics, his or her independence and the needs of the board of directors. At a minimum, each nominee must have high personal and professional integrity, have demonstrated ability and judgment, and be effective, in conjunction with the other directors and nominees, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee plans to select persons for nomination to so that a majority of the board will, upon such appointment, continue to be "independent" in accordance with rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees shall remain comprised entirely of independent directors. Although there is no specific policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider whether the nominee, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of board members that represents a diversity of background and experience. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may consider whether the nominee has direct experience in the retail, manufacturing and/or cannabis industries or in the markets in which we operate. 
All securityholder recommendations for director candidates must be submitted in writing to our Secretary at KushCo Holdings, Inc., 11958 Monarch Street, Garden Grove, CA 92841, who will forward all recommendations to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. All securityholder recommendations for director candidates must be submitted to us not less than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of the date on which our proxy statement was released to securityholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. All securityholder recommendations for director candidates must include:

Although ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our By-laws or otherwise, the board is submitting the appointment of RBSM LLP to our stockholders for ratification because we value the views of our stockholders. In the event that our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment of RBSM LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of RBSM LLP.

PROPOSAL 3  APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO 2016 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
Overview 
We are proposing that our stockholders approve the amendment of the KushCo Holdings, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the "2016 Plan" and such amendment, the "Plan Amendment") to increase by 3,000,000 shares the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 Plan from 15,000,000 shares to 18,000,000 shares and to reflect our name change from "Kush Bottles, Inc." to "KushCo Holdings, Inc." that became effect in September 2018. Our board of directors believes that our continued growth and success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain a competitive position by attracting, retaining and motivating key employees with experience and ability, which is vital to our future success, and to align our employees' compensation with building stockholder value. Our 2016 Plan is an integral part of this strategy. An increase in shares available under the 2016 Plan is necessary not only to retain current employees but also to attract new talent as we grow. We anticipate that the shares currently available under our 2016 Plan will be insufficient to meet our future needs, thus potentially impairing our ability to attract and retain key employees through the grant of stock-based awards. The 2016 Plan is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees, directors and consultants of the Company and to further the growth and financial success of the Company by aligning the interests of such persons through ownership with the interests of our stockholders. 
The 2016 Plan currently authorizes the grant of stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. Currently, 15,000,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2016 Plan. On December 20, 2018, the board of directors approved the Plan Amendment, subject to stockholder approval. 
Our board of directors believes that the proposed amendment of the 2016 Plan is in the best interests of, and will provide long-term advantages to, us and our stockholders and recommends the approval by our stockholders of the Plan Amendment. Stock options and other stock-based incentive awards are given to the employees, officers, directors and consultants of our Company upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts we largely depend for the successful conduct of our business. These incentives provide our employees with a proprietary interest in our Company, thereby stimulating their commitment on our behalf and strengthening their desire to remain with us. Our board of directors anticipates that this direct stake in the future success of our Company also assures a closer alignment of the interests of employees with those of our stockholders. Our board of directors believes that the number of shares of common stock currently available for issuance under our 2016 Plan is insufficient in view of our anticipated growth, compensation structure, and strategy. If we cannot increase the amount of shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to the Plan Amendment, it could have a negative impact on our ability to retain and attract key employees. Accordingly, we are seeking stockholder approval of the Plan Amendment. In the event that the Plan Amendment is not approved by stockholders, the 2016 Plan will continue in effect without the amendment described above. 
Based solely on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the OTC Markets Group's OTCQB Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on December 27, 2018, the maximum aggregate market value of the 3,000,000 additional shares that could potentially be issued under the 2016 Plan, as amended, is approximately $14.6 million. The shares available for issuance by us under the 2016 Plan will be authorized but unissued shares. 
As of December 28, 2018: (i) 5,882,307 shares of our common stock remained available for future awards under our 2016 Plan; and (ii) 9,367,693 shares of our common stock were subject to outstanding options under our 2016 Plan (with the outstanding options having a weighted average exercise price of $3.80 per share and a weighted average term to scheduled expiration of 9.1 years). During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, our board of directors approved the grant of options to purchase 7,177,500 shares of Common Stock under our 2016 Plan. 
The following description of certain features of the 2016 Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment, is intended to be a summary only. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2016 Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment, that is attached hereto as Appendix A.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Summary of the 2016 Plan, as Amended 
Our 2016 Plan was adopted by our board of directors in February 2016 and was approved by consent of stockholders holding a majority of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The 2016 Plan is administered by our board of directors. 
Share Reserve.   The number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under our 2016 Plan, as amended, will be 18,000,000 shares. 
In general, if awards under the 2016 Plan terminate or expire without the issuance of shares, or if we repurchase shares issued under the 2016 Plan, then such shares will again become available for awards. All share numbers described in this summary of the 2016 Plan will automatically adjust in the event of a stock split, a stock dividend, a combination or reclassification of shares, a recapitalization, a merger or similar event. 
Administration.   The 2016 Plan is administered by our board of directors, provided however, that the board may delegate such administration to any committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2016 Plan, the board of directors and/or committee thereof will have authority to, among other things, (i) grant incentive stock options in accordance with Section 422 of the Code, or non-qualified options, stock awards or restricted stock purchase offers; (ii) determine the fair market value of the stock covered by any grant; (iii) determine which eligible persons will receive grants and the number of shares, restrictions, terms and conditions to be included in such grants; (iv) construe and interpret the 2016 Plan; (v) promulgate, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to its administration, and correct defects, omissions and inconsistencies in the 2016 Plan or any grant; and (vi) consistent with the 2016 Plan and with the consent of the participant, as appropriate, amend any outstanding grant or amend the exercise date or dates thereof. The interpretation and construction by the board of directors of any provisions of the 2016 Plan or selection of participants is conclusive and final. 
Eligibility.   The persons who are eligible to receive grants are our directors, officers, employees or consultants. 
Terms and Conditions of Options.   Options granted under the 2016 Plan will be evidenced by agreements between the Company and the respective optionees, in such form and substance as the board or committee thereof will from time to time approve. Any option granted to an employee, consultant or director of the Company will become exercisable over a period of no longer than ten (10) years. Unless otherwise specified by the board or the committee thereof in the resolution authorizing such option, the date of grant of an option will be deemed to be the date upon which the board or committee authorizes the granting of such option. 
If optionee's status as an employee will terminate for any reason other than optionee's disability or death, then optionee (or if the optionee will die after such termination, but prior to exercise, optionee's personal representative or the person entitled to succeed to the option) will have the right to exercise the portions of any of optionee's incentive stock options which were exercisable as of the date of such termination, in whole or in part, within 90 days after such termination or, in the event of  "termination for good cause" as that term is defined by Nevada case law, the terms of the 2016 Plan or the option agreement or an employment agreement, the option will automatically terminate as of the termination of employment as to all shares covered by the option. With respect to non-qualified options granted to employees, directors or consultants, the board of directors may specify such period for exercise, not less than 90 days after such termination following termination of employment or services as the board deems reasonable and appropriate, except that in the case of  "termination for cause" or removal of a director, the option will automatically terminate as of the termination of employment or services as to shares covered by the option. The option may be exercised only with respect to installments that the optionee could have exercised at the date of termination of employment or services. No option shall be transferable by the optionee, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
Recapitalization.   Subject to any required action of stockholders, the number of shares of common stock covered by each outstanding option, and the exercise price per share thereof set forth in each such option, will be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of  TABLE OF CONTENTS
common stock of the Company resulting from a stock split, stock dividend, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares, or the payment of a stock dividend, or any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares affected without receipt of consideration by the Company.
Modification, Acceleration, Extension, and Renewal of Options.   Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the 2016 Plan, the board of directors may modify an option, or, once an option is exercisable, accelerate the rate at which it may be exercised, and may extend or renew outstanding options granted under the 2016 Plan or accept the surrender of outstanding options (to the extent not theretofore exercised) and authorize the granting of new options in substitution for such options, provided such action is permissible under the applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Purchase Offers.   All or part of any stock award under the 2016 Plan may be subject to conditions established by the board of directors or committee thereof. Such awards may be based on fair market value or other specified valuation. A grant of a restricted stock purchase offer under the 2016 Plan shall be subject to such (i) vesting contingencies related to the participant's continued association with us for a specified time and (ii) other specified conditions as the board or committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, consistent with the provisions of the 2016 Plan. 
No Assignment.   No grant or any other benefit under the 2016 Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or payable to or exercisable by, anyone other than the participant to whom it was granted. 
Effective and Termination Date.   The 2016 Plan became effective on the date it is approved by the board of directors, on February 9, 2016. The 2016 Plan will terminate ten years later, on February 9, 2026, subject to earlier termination by the board of directors. 
Amendment or Termination of the 2016 Plan.   The Board may at any time, and from time to time, suspend or terminate the 2016 Plan in whole or in part or amend it from time to time, except that no change may be made without the approval of our stockholders to (i) increase the number of shares subject to the 2016 Plan, (ii) decrease the price at which awards may be granted, (iii) materially increase the benefits to participants, or (iv) change the class of persons eligible to receive Awards under the 2016 Plan. 
Tax Aspects Under the Code 
The following is a summary of the principal federal income tax consequences of certain transactions under the 2016 Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment. It does not describe all federal tax consequences under the 2016 Plan, nor does it describe state or local tax consequences. 
Incentive Options.   No taxable income is generally realized by the optionee upon the grant or exercise of an incentive option. If shares issued to an optionee pursuant to the exercise of an incentive option are sold or transferred after two years from the date of grant and after one year from the date of exercise, then (1) upon sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price (the amount paid for the shares) will be taxed to the optionee as a long-term capital gain, and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (2) there will be no deduction for us for federal income tax purposes. The exercise of an incentive option will give rise to an item of tax preference that may result in alternative minimum tax liability for the optionee. 
If shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive option are disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-year and one-year holding periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), generally (a) the optionee will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on a sale of such shares) over the option price thereof, and (b) we will be entitled to deduct such amount. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the incentive option is paid by tendering shares. 
If an incentive option is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies for the tax treatment described above (e.g., if the holding periods described above are not satisfied), the option is treated as a non-qualified option. In addition, an incentive option will not be eligible for the tax treatment described above if it is exercised more than three months following termination of employment (or one year in the case of termination of employment by reason of disability). In the case of termination of employment by reason of death, the three-month rule does not apply. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Non-Qualified Options.   No income is realized by the optionee at the time the option is granted. Generally (i) at exercise, ordinary income is realized by the optionee in an amount equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and we receive a tax deduction for the same amount, and (ii) at disposition, appreciation or depreciation after the date of exercise is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain or loss depending on how long the shares have been held. Special rules will apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of the non-qualified option is paid by tendering shares. Upon exercise, the optionee will also be subject to Social Security taxes on the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price of the option. 
Restricted Stock.   A participant who receives a grant of restricted stock will not recognize any taxable income at the time of the award, provided the shares are subject to restrictions (that is, they are nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture). A participant's rights in restricted stock awarded under the 2016 Plan are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if the rights to full enjoyment of the shares are conditioned, directly or indirectly, upon the future performance of substantial services by the participant. However, the participant may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to recognize compensation income in the year of the award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the award, determined without regard to the restrictions. If the participant does not make a Section 83(b) election within 30 days of receipt of the restricted shares, the fair market value of the shares on the date the restrictions lapse, less any amount paid by the participant for such shares, will be treated as compensation income to the participant and will be taxable in the year the restrictions lapse. We generally will be entitled to a compensation deduction for the amount of compensation income the participant recognizes. 
Parachute Payments.   The vesting of any portion of an option or other award that is accelerated due to the occurrence of a change in control may cause a portion of the payments with respect to such accelerated awards to be treated as "parachute payments" as defined in the Code. Any such parachute payments may be non-deductible to us, in whole or in part, and may subject the recipient to a non-deductible 20% federal excise tax on all or a portion of such payment (in addition to other taxes ordinarily payable).
New Plan Benefits 
No grants have been issued with respect to the additional shares to be reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment. The number of shares that may be granted to our Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, non-employee directors (other than the automatically granted awards) and non-executive officers under the 2016 Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendment, is not determinable at this time, as such grants are subject to the discretion of the board of directors. Information about the non-qualified stock options granted to non-employee directors can be found herein under the heading "Director Compensation." The following table provides information with respect to the number of shares granted under the 2016 Plan for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 to our executive officers as of that date, directors who are not executive officers, and employees. Information about the number of shares granted to our Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers can be found herein under the heading "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End."

TABLE OF CONTENTS
3. Eligibility.
(a) General: The persons who shall be eligible to receive Grants shall be directors, officers, employees or consultants to the Company. The term consultant shall mean any person, other than an employee, who is engaged by the Company to render services and is compensated for such services. An Optionee may hold more than one Option. Any issuance of a Grant to an officer or director of the Company subsequent to the first registration of any of the securities of the Company under the Exchange Act shall comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3. 
(b) Incentive Stock Options: Incentive Stock Options may only be issued to employees of the Company. Incentive Stock Options may be granted to officers or directors, provided they are also employees of the Company. Payment of a director's fee shall not be sufficient to constitute employment by the Company. 
(c) The Company shall not grant an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan to any employee if such Grant would result in such employee holding the right to exercise for the first time in any one calendar year, under all Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan or any other plan maintained by the Company, with respect to shares of Stock having an aggregate fair market value, determined as of the date the Option is granted, in excess of  $100,000. Should it be determined that an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan exceeds such maximum for any reason other than a failure in good faith to value the Stock subject to such option, the excess portion of such option shall be considered a Nonstatutory Option. To the extent the employee holds two (2) or more such Options which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, the foregoing limitation on the exercisability of such Option as Incentive Stock Options under the Federal tax laws shall be applied on the basis of the order in which such Options are granted. If, for any reason, an entire Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of exceeding such maximum, such Option shall be considered a Nonstatutory Option. 
(d) Nonstatutory Option: The provisions of the foregoing Section 3(b) shall not apply to any Option designated as a "Nonstatutory Option" or which sets forth the intention of the parties that the Option be a Nonstatutory Option. 
(e) Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Purchase Offers: The provisions of this Section 3 shall not apply to any Stock Award or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer under the Plan. 
4. Stock
(a) Authorized Stock: Stock subject to Grants may be either unissued or reacquired Stock. 
(b) Number of Shares: Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(i) of the Plan, the total number of shares of Stock which may be purchased or granted directly by Options, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers, or purchased indirectly through exercise of Options granted under the Plan shall not exceed eighteenfifteen million (18,000,00015,000,000). If any Grant shall for any reason terminate or expire, any shares allocated thereto but remaining unpurchased upon such expiration or termination shall again be available for Grants with respect thereto under the Plan as though no Grant had previously occurred with respect to such shares. Any shares of Stock issued pursuant to a Grant and repurchased pursuant to the terms thereof shall be available for future Grants as though not previously covered by a Grant. 
(c) Reservation of Shares: The Company shall reserve and keep available at all times during the term of the Plan such number of shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. If, after reasonable efforts, which efforts shall not include the registration of the Plan or Grants under the Securities Act, the Company is unable to obtain authority from any applicable regulatory body, which authorization is deemed necessary by legal counsel for the Company for the lawful issuance of shares hereunder, the Company shall be relieved of any liability with respect to its failure to issue and sell the shares for which such requisite authority was so deemed necessary unless and until such authority is obtained. 
(d) Application of Funds: The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Stock pursuant to the exercise of Options or rights will be used for general corporate purposes. 
(e) No Obligation to Exercise: The issuance of a Grant shall impose no obligation upon the Participant to exercise any rights under such Grant.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
5. Terms and Conditions of Options. Options granted hereunder shall be evidenced by agreements between the Company and the respective Optionees, in such form and substance as the Board or Committee shall from time to time approve. Option agreements need not be identical, and in each case may include such provisions as the Board or Committee may determine, but all such agreements shall be subject to and limited by the following terms and conditions: 
(a) Number of Shares: Each Option shall state the number of shares to which it pertains. 
(b) Exercise Price: Each Incentive Stock Option shall state the exercise price, which shall be determined as follows: 
(i) Any Incentive Stock Option granted to a person who at the time the Option is granted owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company ("Ten Percent Holder") shall have an exercise price of no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock as of the date of grant; and 
(ii) Incentive Stock Options granted to a person who at the time the Option is granted is not a Ten Percent Holder shall have an exercise price of no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock as of the date of grant. 
For the purposes of this Section 5(b), the Fair Market Value shall be as determined by the Board in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive and binding; provided however, that if there is an active public market for such Stock, the Fair Market Value per share shall be the closing price if such stock is listed on such public market on the date of grant of the Option, or if listed on a stock exchange, the closing price on such exchange on such date of grant. 
The exercise price of each Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 
(c) Medium and Time of Payment: The exercise price shall become immediately due upon exercise of the Option and shall be paid in cash or check made payable to the Company. Should the Company's outstanding Stock be registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act at the time the Option is exercised, then the exercise price may also be paid as follows: 
(i) in shares of Stock held by the Optionee for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date, or 
(ii) through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the Optionee shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (a) to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company by reason of such purchase and (b) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction. 
(iii) At the discretion of the Board, exercisable either at the time of Option grant or of Option exercise, the exercise price may also be paid (i) by Optionee's delivery of a promissory note in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and permissible under applicable securities rules and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion, but in no event less than the minimum rate of interest required to avoid the imputation of compensation income to the Optionee under the Federal tax laws, or (ii) in such other form of consideration permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes as may be acceptable to the Board. 
(d) Term and Exercise of Options: Any Option granted to an employee of the Company shall become exercisable over a period of no longer than ten (10) years. In no event shall any Option be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it is granted, and no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten 
A-4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Percent Holder shall, by its terms, be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date of the Option. Unless otherwise specified by the Board or the Committee in the resolution authorizing such Option, the date of grant of an Option shall be deemed to be the date upon which the Board or the Committee authorizes the granting of such Option. 
Each Option shall be exercisable to the nearest whole share, in installments or otherwise, as the respective Option agreements may provide. During the lifetime of an Optionee, the Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee and shall not be assignable or transferable by the Optionee, and no other person shall acquire any rights therein. To the extent not exercised, installments (if more than one) shall accumulate, but shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, only during the period for exercise as stated in the Option agreement, whether or not other installments are then exercisable. 
(e) Termination of Status as Employee, Consultant or Director: If Optionee's status as an employee shall terminate for any reason other than Optionee's disability or death, then Optionee (or if the Optionee shall die after such termination, but prior to exercise, Optionee's personal representative or the person entitled to succeed to the Option) shall have the right to exercise the portions of any of Optionee's Incentive Stock Options which were exercisable as of the date of such termination, in whole or in part, within 90 days after such termination (or, in the event of  "termination for good cause" as that term is defined in Nevada case law related thereto, or by the terms of the Plan or the Option Agreement or an employment agreement, the Option shall automatically terminate as of the termination of employment as to all shares covered by the Option). 
With respect to Nonstatutory Options granted to employees, directors or consultants, the Board may specify such period for exercise, not less than 90 days (except that in the case of  "termination for cause" or removal of a director), the Option shall automatically terminate as of the termination of employment or services as to shares covered by the Option, following termination of employment or services as the Board deems reasonable and appropriate. The Option may be exercised only with respect to installments that the Optionee could have exercised at the date of termination of employment or services. Nothing contained herein or in any Option granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to affect or restrict in any way the right of the Company to terminate the employment or services of an Optionee with or without cause. 
(f) Disability of Optionee: If an Optionee is disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) at the time of termination, the ninety (90) day period set forth in Section 5(e) shall be a period, as determined by the Board and set forth in the Option, of not less than six months nor more than one year after such termination. 
(g) Death of Optionee: If an Optionee dies while employed by, engaged as a consultant to, or serving as a Director of the Company, the portion of such Optionee's Option which was exercisable at the date of death may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the estate of the decedent or by a person succeeding to the right to exercise such Option at any time within (i) a period, as determined by the Board and set forth in the Option, of not less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year after Optionee's death, which period shall not be more, in the case of a Nonstatutory Option, than the period for exercise following termination of employment or services, or (ii) during the remaining term of the Option, whichever is the lesser. The Option may be so exercised only with respect to installments exercisable at the time of Optionee's death and not previously exercised by the Optionee. 
(h) Nontransferability of Option: No Option shall be transferable by the Optionee, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
(i) Recapitalization: Subject to any required action of shareholders, the number of shares of Stock covered by each outstanding Option, and the exercise price per share thereof set forth in each such Option, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Stock of the Company resulting from a stock split, stock dividend, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares, or the payment of a stock dividend, or any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares affected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, the conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration" by the Company.

In the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity, or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Company (collectively, a "Reorganization"), unless otherwise provided by the Board, this Option shall terminate immediately prior to such date as is determined by the Board, which date shall be no later than the consummation of such Reorganization. In such event, if the entity which shall be the surviving entity does not tender to Optionee an offer, for which it has no obligation to do so, to substitute for any unexercised Option a stock option or capital stock of such surviving entity, as applicable, which on an equitable basis shall provide the Optionee with substantially the same economic benefit as such unexercised Option, then the Board may grant to such Optionee, in its sole and absolute discretion and without obligation, the right for a period commencing thirty (30) days prior to and ending immediately prior to the date determined by the Board pursuant hereto for termination of the Option or during the remaining term of the Option, whichever is the lesser, to exercise any unexpired Option or Options without regard to the installment provisions of Paragraph 6(d) of the Plan; provided, that any such right granted shall be granted to all Optionees not receiving an offer to receive substitute options on a consistent basis, and provided further, that any such exercise shall be subject to the consummation of such Reorganization. 
Subject to any required action of shareholders, if the Company shall be the surviving entity in any merger or consolidation, each outstanding Option thereafter shall pertain to and apply to the securities to which a holder of shares of Stock equal to the shares subject to the Option would have been entitled by reason of such merger or consolidation. 
In the event of a change in the Stock of the Company as presently constituted, which is limited to a change of all of its authorized shares without par value into the same number of shares with a par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Stock within the meaning of the Plan. 
To the extent that the foregoing adjustments relate to stock or securities of the Company, such adjustments shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided in this Section 5(i), the Optionee shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class or the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class, and the number or price of shares of Stock subject to any Option shall not be affected by, and no adjustment shall be made by reason of, any dissolution, liquidation, merger, consolidation or sale of assets or capital stock, or any issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class. 
The Grant of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make any adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes in its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. 
(j) Rights as a Shareholder: An Optionee shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option until the effective date of the issuance of the shares following exercise of such Option by Optionee. No adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued, except as expressly provided in Section 5(i) hereof. 
(k) Modification, Acceleration, Extension, and Renewal of Options: Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, the Board may modify an Option, or, once an Option is exercisable, accelerate the rate at which it may be exercised, and may extend or renew outstanding Options granted under the Plan or accept the surrender of outstanding Options (to the extent not theretofore exercised) and authorize the granting of new Options in substitution for such Options, provided such action is permissible under Section 422 of the Code and applicable state securities laws. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(k), however, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Optionee, alter to the Optionee's detriment or impair any rights or obligations under any Option theretofore granted under the Plan.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
(l) Exercise Before Exercise Date: At the discretion of the Board, the Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionee may elect to exercise all or any portion of the Option prior to the stated exercise date of the Option or any installment thereof. Any shares so purchased prior to the stated exercise date shall be subject to repurchase by the Company upon termination of Optionee's employment as contemplated by Section 5(n) hereof prior to the exercise date stated in the Option and such other restrictions and conditions as the Board or Committee may deem advisable. 
(m) Other Provisions: The Option agreements authorized under the Plan shall contain such other provisions, including, without limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of the Options, as the Board or the Committee shall deem advisable. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option, if the exercise of such Option or the issuance of shares thereunder would violate, in the opinion of legal counsel for the Company, the provisions of any applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable governmental or administrative agency or body, such as the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, applicable state securities laws, the corporate law of the state of Nevada, and the rules promulgated under the foregoing or the rules and regulations of any exchange upon which the shares of the Company are listed. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the exercise of each Option shall be subject to the condition that if at any time the Company shall determine that (i) the satisfaction of withholding tax or other similar liabilities, or (ii) the listing, registration or qualification of any shares covered by such exercise upon any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or (iii) the consent or approval of any regulatory body, or (iv) the perfection of any exemption from any such withholding, listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval is necessary or desirable in connection with such exercise or the issuance of shares thereunder, then in any such event, such exercise shall not be effective unless such withholding, listing registration, qualification, consent, approval or exemption shall have been effected, obtained or perfected free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. 
(n) Repurchase Agreement: The Board may, in its discretion, require as a condition to the Grant of an Option hereunder, that an Optionee execute an agreement with the Company, in form and substance satisfactory to the Board in its discretion ("Repurchase Agreement"), (i) restricting the Optionee's right to transfer shares purchased under such Option without first offering such shares to the Company or another shareholder of the Company upon the same terms and conditions as provided therein; and (ii) providing that upon termination of Optionee's employment with the Company, for any reason, the Company (or another shareholder of the Company, as provided in the Repurchase Agreement) shall have the right at its discretion (or the discretion of such other shareholders) to purchase and/or redeem all such shares owned by the Optionee on the date of termination of his or her employment at a price equal to: (A) the fair value of such shares as of such date of termination; or (B) if such repurchase right lapses at 20% of the number of shares per year, the original purchase price of such shares, and upon terms of payment permissible under the applicable state securities laws; provided that in the case of Options or Stock Awards granted to officers, directors, consultants or affiliates of the Company, such repurchase provisions may be subject to additional or greater restrictions as determined by the Board or Committee. 
6. Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Purchase Offers.
(a) Types of Grants. 
(i) Stock Award. All or part of any Stock Award under the Plan may be subject to conditions established by the Board or the Committee, and set forth in the Stock Award Agreement, which may include, but are not limited to, continuous service with the Company, achievement of specific business objectives, increases in specified indices, attaining growth rates and other comparable measurements of Company performance. Such Awards may be based on Fair Market Value or other specified valuation. 
(ii) Restricted Stock Purchase Offer. A Grant of a Restricted Stock Purchase Offer under the Plan shall be subject to such (i) vesting contingencies related to the Participant's continued association with the Company for a specified time and (ii) other specified conditions as the Board or Committee shall determine, in their sole discretion, consistent with the provisions of the Plan. 
(b) Conditions and Restrictions. Shares of Stock which Participants may receive as a Stock Award under a Stock Award Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer under a Restricted Stock Purchase Offer may include such restrictions as the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall determine, including

TABLE OF CONTENTS
restrictions on transfer, repurchase rights, right of first refusal, and forfeiture provisions. When transfer of Stock is so restricted or subject to forfeiture provisions it is referred to as "Restricted Stock." Further, with Board or Committee approval, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers may be deferred, either in the form of installments or a future lump sum distribution. The Board or Committee may permit selected Participants to elect to defer distributions of Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers in accordance with procedures established by the Board or Committee to assure that such deferrals comply with applicable requirements of the Code including, at the choice of Participants, the capability to make further deferrals for distribution after retirement. Any deferred distribution, whether elected by the Participant or specified by the Stock Award Agreement, Restricted Stock Purchase Offers or by the Board or Committee, may require the payment be forfeited in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(c). Dividends or dividend equivalent rights may be extended to and made part of any Stock Award or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers denominated in Stock or units of Stock, subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as the Board or Committee may establish. 
(c) Cancellation and Rescission of Grants. Unless the Stock Award Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer specifies otherwise, the Board or Committee, as applicable, may cancel any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Grants at any time if the Participant is not in compliance with all other applicable provisions of the Stock Award Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer, the Plan and with the following conditions: 
(i) A Participant shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the judgment of the chief executive officer of the Company or other senior officer designated by the Board or Committee, is or becomes competitive with the Company, or which organization or business, or the rendering of services to such organization or business, is or becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company. For Participants whose employment has terminated, the judgment of the chief executive officer shall be based on the Participant's position and responsibilities while employed by the Company, the Participant's post-employment responsibilities and position with the other organization or business, the extent of past, current and potential competition or conflict between the Company and the other organization or business, the effect on the Company's customers, suppliers and competitors and such other considerations as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and circumstances. A Participant who has retired shall be free, however, to purchase as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities of such organization or business so long as they are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter, and such investment does not represent a substantial investment to the Participant or a greater than ten percent (10%) equity interest in the organization or business. 
(ii) A Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from the Company, disclose to anyone outside the Company, or use in other than the Company's business, any confidential information or material, relating to the business of the Company, acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the Company. 
(iii) A Participant shall disclose promptly and assign to the Company all right, title and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the Participant during employment by the Company, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of the Company and shall do anything reasonably necessary to enable the Company to secure a patent where appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries. 
(iv) Upon exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant, the Participant shall certify on a form acceptable to the Committee that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Failure to comply with all of the provisions of this Section 6(c) prior to, or during the six months after, any exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant shall cause such exercise, payment or delivery to be rescinded. The Company shall notify the Participant in writing of any such rescission within two years after such exercise, payment or delivery. Within ten days after receiving such a notice from the Company, the Participant shall pay to the Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to a Grant. Such payment shall be made either in cash or by returning to the Company the number of shares of Stock that the Participant received in connection with the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery.

(d) Nonassignability. 
(i) Except pursuant to Section 6(e)(iii) and except as set forth in Section 6(d)(ii), no Grant or any other benefit under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or payable to or exercisable by, anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted. 
(ii) Where a Participant terminates employment and retains a Grant pursuant to Section 6(e)(ii) in order to assume a position with a governmental, charitable or educational institution, the Board or Committee, in its discretion and to the extent permitted by law, may authorize a third party (including but not limited to the trustee of a "blind" trust), acceptable to the applicable governmental or institutional authorities, the Participant and the Board or Committee, to act on behalf of the Participant with regard to such Awards. 
(e) Termination of Employment. If the employment or service to the Company of a Participant terminates, other than pursuant to any of the following provisions under this Section 6(e), all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers shall be cancelled immediately, unless the Stock Award Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer provides otherwise: 
(i) Retirement Under a Company Retirement Plan. When a Participant's employment terminates as a result of retirement in accordance with the terms of a Company retirement plan, the Board or Committee may permit Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers to continue in effect beyond the date of retirement in accordance with the applicable Grant Agreement and the exercisability and vesting of any such Grants may be accelerated. 
(ii) Rights in the Best Interests of the Company. When a Participant resigns from the Company and, in the judgment of the Board or Committee, the acceleration and/or continuation of outstanding Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers would be in the best interests of the Company, the Board or Committee may (i) authorize, where appropriate, the acceleration and/or continuation of all or any part of Grants issued prior to such termination and (ii) permit the exercise, vesting and payment of such Grants for such period as may be set forth in the applicable Grant Agreement, subject to earlier cancellation pursuant to Section 9 or at such time as the Board or Committee shall deem the continuation of all or any part of the Participant's Grants are not in the Company's best interest. 
(iii) Death or Disability of a Participant. 
1. In the event of a Participant's death, the Participant's estate or beneficiaries shall have a period up to the expiration date specified in the Grant Agreement within which to receive or exercise any outstanding Grant held by the Participant under such terms as may be specified in the applicable Grant Agreement. Rights to any such outstanding Grants shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution in the following order: (a) to beneficiaries so designated by the Participant; if none, then (b) to a legal representative of the Participant; if none, then (c) to the persons entitled thereto as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Grants so passing shall be made at such times and in such manner as if the Participant were living. 
2. In the event a Participant is deemed by the Board or Committee to be unable to perform his or her usual duties by reason of mental disorder or medical condition which does not result from facts which would be grounds for termination for cause, Grants and rights to any such Grants may be paid to or exercised by the Participant, if legally competent, or a committee or other legally designated guardian or representative if the Participant is legally incompetent by virtue of such disability. 
3. After the death or disability of a Participant, the Board or Committee may in its sole discretion at any time (1) terminate restrictions in Grant Agreements; (2) accelerate any or all installments and rights; and (3) instruct the Company to pay the total of any accelerated payments in a lump sum to the Participant, the Participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative; notwithstanding that, in the absence of such termination of restrictions or acceleration of payments, any or all of the payments due under the Grant might ultimately have become payable to other beneficiaries.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
4. In the event of uncertainty as to interpretation of or controversies concerning this Section 6, the determinations of the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall be binding and conclusive. 
7. Change in Control. Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Grant Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, 50% of the vesting restrictions applicable to each Participant's Grant(s) shall terminate fully and the Participant shall immediately have the right to the delivery of share certificates or exercise of Options, i.e. to the extent that a Participant's Option(s) are unvested, 50% of such unvested portion shall vest. 
8. Investment Intent. All Grants under the Plan are intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 701 thereunder. Unless and until the granting of Options or sale and issuance of Stock subject to the Plan are registered under the Securities Act or shall be exempt pursuant to the rules promulgated thereunder, each Grant under the Plan shall provide that the purchases or other acquisitions of Stock thereunder shall be for investment purposes and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Further, unless the issuance and sale of the Stock have been registered under the Securities Act, each Grant shall provide that no shares shall be purchased upon the exercise of the rights under such Grant unless and until (i) all then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies shall have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel, and (ii) if requested to do so by the Company, the person exercising the rights under the Grant shall (A) give written assurances as to knowledge and experience of such person (or a representative employed by such person) in financial and business matters and the ability of such person (or representative) to evaluate the merits and risks of exercising the Option, and (B) execute and deliver to the Company a letter of investment intent and/or such other form related to applicable exemptions from registration, all in such form and substance as the Company may require. If shares are issued upon exercise of any rights under a Grant without registration under the Securities Act, subsequent registration of such shares shall relieve the purchaser thereof of any investment restrictions or representations made upon the exercise of such rights. 
9. Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance of the Plan. The Board may, insofar as permitted by law, from time to time, with respect to any shares at the time not subject to outstanding Grants, suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever, except that without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, no such revision or amendment shall (i) increase the number of shares subject to the Plan, (ii) decrease the price at which Grants may be granted, (iii) materially increase the benefits to Participants, or (iv) change the class of persons eligible to receive Grants under the Plan; provided, however, no such action shall alter or impair the rights and obligations under any Option, or Stock Award, or Restricted Stock Purchase Offer outstanding as of the date thereof without the written consent of the Participant thereunder. No Grant may be issued while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated, but the rights and obligations under any Grant issued while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan. 
In the event of any change in the outstanding Stock by reason of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger, or similar event, the Board or the Committee may adjust proportionally (a) the number of shares of Stock (i) reserved under the Plan, (ii) available for Incentive Stock Options and Nonstatutory Options and (iii) covered by outstanding Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers; (b) the Stock prices related to outstanding Grants; and (c) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations for such Grants. In the event of any other change affecting the Stock or any distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of Stock, such adjustments as may be deemed equitable by the Board or the Committee, including adjustments to avoid fractional shares, shall be made to give proper effect to such event. In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Board or the Committee shall be authorized to issue or assume stock options, whether or not in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, and other Grants by means of substitution of new Grant Agreements for previously issued Grants or an assumption of previously issued Grants.

10. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct applicable taxes from any Grant payment and withhold, at the time of delivery or exercise of Options, Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Purchase Offers or vesting of shares under such Grants, an appropriate number of shares for payment of taxes required by law or to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for withholding of such taxes. If Stock is used to satisfy tax withholding, such stock shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value when the tax withholding is required to be made. Each Participant understands that such Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of an award or grant of options or Shares. Participant represents that Participant has consulted any tax consultants Participant deems advisable in connection with the receipt of the options or Shares and that Participant is not relying on the Company or the Company's counsel for any tax advice. The Company intends to report the value of the options or Shares received, if applicable, to appropriate tax authorities. The Company has the authority to require Participant to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, and local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the receipt of the Shares. 
11. Availability of Information. During the term of the Plan and any additional period during which a Grant granted pursuant to the Plan shall be exercisable, the Company shall make available, not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the close of each of its fiscal years, such financial and other information regarding the Company as is required by the bylaws of the Company and applicable law to be furnished in an annual report to the shareholders of the Company.
12. Notice. Any written notice to the Company required by any of the provisions of the Plan shall be addressed to the chief financial officer or to the chief executive officer of the Company, and shall become effective when it is received by the office of the chief financial officer or the chief executive officer. 
13. Indemnification of Board. In addition to such other rights or indemnifications as they may have as directors or otherwise, and to the extent allowed by applicable law, the members of the Board and the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against the reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal thereof, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken, or failure to act, under or in connection with the Plan or any Grant granted thereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof  (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, except in any case in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such claim, action, suit or proceeding that such Board or Committee member is liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duties; provided that within sixty (60) days after institution of any such action, suit or Board proceeding the member involved shall offer the Company, in writing, the opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same. 
14. Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the securities laws of the United States, shall be governed by the law of the State of California and construed accordingly. 
15. Termination Dates. The Plan shall terminate ten years following the initial adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors, subject to earlier termination by the Board pursuant to Section 9. 
The foregoing 2016 Stock Incentive Plan was duly adopted and approved by the Board of Directors as of February 9, 2016, and the first amendment thereto was duly adopted and approved by the Board of Directors as of March 9, 2018 and the second amendment thereto was duly adopted and approved by the Board of Directors as of December 20, 2018.
