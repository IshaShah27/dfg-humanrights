PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  April 25, 2019
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Avalon Holdings Corporation (the "Company") of proxies in the form enclosed herewith to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at The Avalon Inn, located at 9519 East Market Street, Warren, Ohio, on Thursday, April 25, 2019, at 10:00 A.M., local time, and at any adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting"), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This Proxy Statement is being sent to each holder of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value, ("Class A Common Stock") and Class B Common Stock, $.01 par value, ("Class B Common Stock," and together with the Class A Common Stock, the "Common Stock") of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting in order to furnish information relating to the business to be transacted at the meeting. The Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements, is being mailed to shareholders, together with this Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy, beginning on or about March 18, 2019. Additionally, the Notice of Meeting, Proxy Statement and our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are available on the internet at http://www.proxyvote.com.
Any shareholder giving a proxy will have the right to revoke it at any time prior to the voting thereof by giving written notice to the Secretary of the Company, by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, or by execution of a subsequent proxy provided that such action is taken in sufficient time to permit the necessary examination and tabulation of the subsequent proxy or revocation before the vote is taken. Shares of Common Stock represented by the proxies in the form enclosed, properly executed, will be voted in the manner designated, or if no applicable instructions are indicated, in favor of the Directors named therein and in favor of the Board recommendations. The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy are authorized to vote, in their discretion, upon such other business as may properly come before the meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only those shares represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy shall be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes required for any proposals upon which shareholders of the Company shall be called upon to vote. If shareholders do not give their brokers instructions as to how to vote shares held in street name, the brokers have discretionary authority to vote those shares on "routine" matters, but not on "non-routine" proposals, such as the election of directors, the advisory votes regarding executive compensation and the long-term incentive plan. As a result, if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is sometimes called a "broker non-vote." Shares held by brokers who do not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter and who have not received voting instructions from their customers will be counted as present for the purposes of determining whether there is a quorum at the annual meeting, but will not be counted or deemed to be present in person or by proxy for the purposes of determining whether our shareholders have approved that matter. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" shall not be counted as votes for or against any matter upon which shareholders of the Company shall be called upon to vote. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company do not permit cumulative voting in the election of Directors.
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF
The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 1, 2019, as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date will be entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. At the Annual Meeting, the holders of Class A Common Stock will be entitled, as a class, to elect two Directors ("Class A Directors") and the holders of Class B Common Stock will be entitled, as a class, to elect three Directors ("Class B Directors," and together with the Class A Directors, the "Directors").
Except for the election of Directors and as otherwise required by the provisions of the Company's Articles of Incorporation or by law, holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will vote or consent as a single class on all matters with each share of Class A Common Stock having one vote per share and each share of Class B Common Stock having ten votes per share. In the event that the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock constitute less than 50% of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the holders of the Class A Common Stock (one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (ten votes per share) will vote as a single class for the election of Directors. At the close of business on March 1, 2019, the Company had 3,263,647 shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding entitling the holders thereof to 3,263,647 votes in the aggregate and 611,784 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding entitling the holders thereof to 6,117,840 votes in the aggregate.
Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the shareholder, into one share of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock are also automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on the transfer of such shares to any person other than the Company, another holder of Class B Common Stock or a "Permitted Transferee" as defined in the Company's Articles of Incorporation. The Class A Common Stock is not convertible.
The following table sets forth information with respect to beneficial ownership of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock by each person known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of either class of Common Stock. This information is as of December 31, 2018, unless noted that it is based upon Schedules 13-D or 13-G filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").

The Board of Directors has established four standing committees to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. These are the Executive, Audit, Option Plan and Compensation Committees. The Board as a whole nominates directors for election. During 2018, the Board of Directors held four meetings.
Each incumbent Director acted pursuant to all written consents without formal meeting and attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board on which the respective Directors served during 2018.

The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending the firm of independent accountants to be engaged to audit the Company's financial statements, reviewing the scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviewing with management and the independent accountants the Company's interim and year-end operating results, considering the adequacy of the internal accounting controls and procedures of the Company and reviewing the non-audit services to be performed by the independent accountants.

Avalon Holdings Corporation is a controlled company because over 50% of the voting power of the Company is held by Mr. Klingle. As such, the Company does not have a Nominating Committee. Because Mr. Klingle holds a majority of the voting power, nominations for Directors are generally based on his recommendations. In general, the Company's Board will nominate existing Directors for re-election unless the Board has a concern about the Director's ability to perform his or her duties. In the event of a vacancy on the Board, potential candidates are evaluated based upon their experience, skills, integrity and background concerning the types of businesses in which the Company operates and how the nominee would complement the existing Board's skills and experience.
The Board of Directors has no formal procedures to be followed in submitting recommendations of candidates for Director. However, nominations for Director may be made by our shareholders, provided such nominations comply with certain timing and information requirements set forth in our bylaws. Nominations should be made via written request to the attention of the Company's Secretary, One American Way, Warren, Ohio 44484.
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the accounting firm that is engaged as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report on SEC Form 10-K with Company's management and independent registered public accounting firm. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America.
In the performance of the Audit Committee's oversight function, we have reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Pubic Company Accounting Oversight Board Audit Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, and such other matters as we have deemed to be appropriate. In addition, the Audit Committee has received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Public Company Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees) regarding its independence.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on SEC Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Executive Compensation
Avalon is a controlled company as defined by the NYSE Amex company guide because over 50% of the voting power is held by Mr. Klingle. During 2018, Mr. Klingle was the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Saksa was Chief Financial Officer. Both Mr. Klingle and Mr. Saksa were members of the Compensation Committee. As such, the members of the Company's Compensation Committee are not all independent. Although the Company's executive compensation program is established by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors, as a whole, discuss the reasonableness of the amounts of compensation received by the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee does not have a charter.
The Company maintains a cash compensation program which is designed to motivate, retain and attract management and is comprised of base salary and discretionary bonuses. The purpose of the base salary is to create a secure base of cash compensation for executives that is competitive with the market. Executive salaries do not follow a preset schedule or formula. For the most part, increases in compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers are dependent upon discretionary bonuses approved by the Board of Directors.
The Compensation Committee discusses and reviews base salaries and discretionary bonuses for all of the executive officers, including Mr. Klingle, the Chief Executive Officer, based upon an evaluation of each individual's performance, any change in responsibilities and their potential to contribute to the success of the Company. No specific weights have been assigned to those factors. Mr. Kenneth McMahon, Chief Executive Officer of American Waste Management Services, Inc. ("AWMS"), received a discretionary bonus, based upon eight percent of the income before taxes of the waste management and brokerage company.
With regard to individual performance of executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee relies to a large extent on the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer's evaluation of each individual executive officer's performance.
In November 2018, the Board of Directors voted not to make a discretionary contribution to the Company's 401(k) Profit sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code addresses the nondeductibility for federal income tax purposes of certain compensation in excess of $1 million paid to an employee during the taxable year. As it is highly unlikely that any executive officer or other employee of the Company will be awarded compensation in excess of $1 million in the foreseeable future, the Compensation Committee has not established a policy with respect to the nondeductibility of such employee compensation.
The Compensation Committee believes that the Chief Executive Officer, as well as, the other executive officers of the Company, are dedicated to achieving significant improvements in the Company's long-term financial performance and that the compensation policies, plans and programs implemented by the Company contribute to achieving those results.
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

The following information sets forth the compensation of the Company's Principal Executive Officer during 2018 and the Company's two most highly compensated executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, who were serving as executive officers as of December 31, 2018; in each case for services rendered in all capacities to the Company and/or its subsidiaries during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

PROPOSAL #2
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
This advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" advisory vote, is not binding on the Company, our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, but rather relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. To the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officers' compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors will consider our shareholders' concerns and evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting is required to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders:
RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Summary Compensation Table and other related tables and disclosures.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers disclosed in this proxy statement.
PROPOSAL #3
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
In addition to Proposal #2 above, shareholders are being asked to vote on an advisory basis, on how frequently Avalon Holdings Corporation should present shareholders with a "Say-on-Pay" vote on compensation of our Named Executive Officers. You may vote to have a Say-on-Pay vote every year, every two years or every three years, or you may abstain. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and enacted SEC rules, at least once every six years we are required to submit for shareholder vote a non-binding resolution to determine whether the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation should occur every year, every two years, or every three years.
This vote on the frequency of shareholder Say-on-Pay votes is advisory, and therefore will not be binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. However, we value our shareholders' opinions and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when recommending a Say-on-Pay voting frequency to the Board. In voting on this proposal, you should be aware that you are not voting "for" or "against" the Board's recommendation on the frequency of holding advisory shareholder Say-on-Pay votes. Rather, you are voting on your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years or three years, or you may abstain from voting on this proposal.
The proposal to determine the frequency of future advisory votes on compensation paid to our named executive officers is non-binding and advisory only and will be decided by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Common Stock in person or by proxy at the annual meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote for the annual ("1 YEAR") option in the advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder Say-on-Pay votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless shareholders specify a contrary choice in their voting instructions.
PROPOSAL # 4
APPROVE THE AVALON HOLDINGS CORPORATION 2019 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
General
We are asking our shareholders to approve the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which represents the renewal of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan") which had 1,300,000 shares available for stock options. The 2009 Plan will expire in October of 2019. The Plan will have 1,300,000 shares available for stock options, less any shares of stock issued pursuant to options exercised under the 2009 Plan. The total number of shares under the Plan and the 2009 Plan will not exceed 1,300,000. The name of the 2009 Plan has been changed to reflect the current year of approval. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, options to purchase 760,000 shares have been granted under the 2009 Plan. Of these, options for 72,000 shares have been exercised, and options for 688,000 shares remain outstanding. On March 14, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the Plan, which is in substantially the same form as the 2009 Plan previously approved by shareholders. The Plan is subject to shareholder approval. A copy of the proposed Plan to be approved is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Purpose of the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The principal purpose of the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan is to a) improve individual employee performance by providing long-term incentives and rewards to employees of the Company and its Affiliates, (b) assist the Company and its Affiliates in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and non-employee directors with experience and ability, and (c) associate the interests of such employees and directors with those of the Company's shareholders
Summary Description of the Plan
The following summary of the Plan, as proposed to be approved by shareholders is qualified in its entirety by the specific language of the Plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Shares Authorized under the Plan and administration of the Plan
The maximum number of shares available for stock options under the Plan is 1,300,000 shares, less the aggregate number of shares issued, or to be issued, under the 2009 Plan. The Plan will be administered by the Option Plan Committee (the" Committee'), which will have full power and authority to administer and interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations, agreements, guidelines and instruments for the administration of the Plan as the Committee deems necessary or advisable. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee will have the authority to: a) determine the Fair Market Value of the stock options at time of grant, b) determine the employees to be granted stock options under the Plan, c) determine the size and applicable terms and conditions of grants to be made to such employees, d) determine the time when the stock options will be granted and to authorize grants to eligible employees, and e) reduce the exercise price of any stock option granted to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by such stock option will have declined since the date the stock option was granted.
All those salaried employees of the Company or any Affiliates as will be determined from time to time by the Committee will be eligible to participate in the Plan. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, in its discretion, grant stock options to one or more Outside Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine, which such terms and conditions will not be inconsistent with the other applicable provisions of the Plan.
All stock options granted under the Plan are intended to be non-qualified stock options for federal income tax purposes except for those stock options designated as incentive stock options which qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No incentive stock options will be granted to an Outside Director or to an employee of an Affiliate which is not a Subsidiary.
The stock option price will be the fair market value of common stock on the Grant Date as determined by the Committee, provided that for stock options designated as incentive stock options the option price will be not less than 110% of Fair Market Value for employees who are Ten Percent Shareholders and not less than 100% of Fair Market Value for other employees.
Stock options will have a term of no longer than ten years from the Grant Date except that for stock options designated as an incentive stock option which is granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, the stock option will have a term no longer than five years. No stock option will be exercisable prior to one year after its grant, unless otherwise provided by the Committee (but in no event before 6 months after its grant), and thereafter stock options will become exercisable in installments, if any, as provided by the Committee.
Adjustments for Change in Stock Subject to the Plan
In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, reorganization, sale by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, or other similar corporate change, such equitable adjustments may be made in the Plan and the stock options granted hereunder as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate, including, if necessary, an adjustment in the number of shares and prices per share or the type or kind of shares or property applicable to stock options then outstanding and in the number of shares which are reserved for issuance under the Plan. Any such adjustment will be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
REQUIRED VOTE AND RECOMMENDATION
The affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast at the meeting at which a quorum is present is required to approve the Avalon Holdings Corporation 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan as set forth in this Proposal. For purposes of the vote on the Proposal, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the Proposal and broker non-votes will have no effect.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of The Avalon Holdings Corporation 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Compensation of Directors
Each of the Company's directors who is not an officer or employee of the Company is entitled to receive a retainer fee of $20,000 per year for Board of Directors membership and a fee of $1,000 for attendance at each Board of Directors meeting ($500 for a committee meeting held on a separate day). Officers and employees who serve as directors are not compensated for their services as directors. In accordance with the Avalon Holdings Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, non-employee directors are entitled to receive grants of options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors. All directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board of Directors meetings and committee meetings.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The SEC requires disclosure of any transactions with related parties in which the amount exceeds $120,000. As defined by the SEC, the term related parties include any director, executive officer, nominee for director or any immediate family member of the director or executive officer, which includes child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.
In August 2013, Avalon created a new Ohio limited liability company, AWMS Holdings, LLC, to act as a holding company to form and own a series of wholly owned subsidiaries that will own and operate salt water injection wells and facilities (together the "facilities"). AWMS Holdings, LLC, offers investment opportunities to accredited investors by selling membership units of AWMS Holdings, LLC through private placement offerings. The monies received from these offerings, along with internally contributed capital, are used to construct the facilities necessary for the operation of salt water injection wells. AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, manages all the salt water injection well operations, including the marketing and sales function and all decisions regarding the well operations for a percentage of the gross revenues. As a result of the private placement offering, Avalon is not the majority owner of AWMS Holdings, LLC; however, due to the managerial control of AWMS Water Solutions, LLC the financial statements of AWMS Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries are included in Avalon's consolidated financial statements.
Mr. Gramley and Mr. Gordon who are each a current director and nominee for director of the Company and are considered related parties, have purchased membership units in AWMS Holdings, LLC totaling $450,000 and $200,000, respectively.

5.     Eligibility. All those salaried employees of the Company or any Affiliates as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Outside Directors shall participate in the Plan only under Section 6(i).
6.     Terms and Conditions of Options. Each Option granted hereunder shall be in writing and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, subject to the following:
(a)     Type. All Options granted under the Plan are intended to be non-qualified stock options for federal income tax purposes except for those Options designated as incentive stock options which qualify under Section 422 of the Code. No incentive stock options shall be granted to an Outside Director or to an employee of an Affiliate which is not a Subsidiary.
(b)     Price. The Option Price shall be the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the Grant Date as determined by the Committee, provided that for Options designated as incentive stock options the Option Price shall be not less than 110% of Fair Market Value for employees who are Ten Percent Shareholders and not less than 100% of Fair Market Value for other employees.
(c)     ISO. In the case of an Option designated as an incentive stock option, the aggregate Fair Market Value of Common Stock (determined at the Grant Date) with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year (under the Plan and under all other such plans of the Company or a Subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000.
(d)     Term and Exercise Dates. Options shall have a term of no longer than ten years from the Grant Date except that for an Option designated as an incentive stock option which is granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder, the Option shall have a term no longer than five years (the date on which the Option terminates is herein called the "Expiration Date"). No Option shall be exercisable prior to one year after its grant, unless otherwise provided by the Committee (but in no event before 6 months after its grant), and thereafter Options shall become exercisable in installments, if any, as provided by the Committee. Options must be exercised for full shares of Common Stock. To the extent that Options are not exercised when they become initially exercisable, they shall be carried forward and be exercisable until the expiration of the term of such Options, subject to Section 6(g) hereof.
(e)     Exercise of Option. To exercise an Option, the holder thereof shall give notice of his or her exercise to the Secretary of the Company, specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased and identifying the Option being exercised. From time to time the Committee may establish procedures for effecting such exercises. No fractional shares shall be issued as a result of exercising an Option. Except as provided for in Section 6(h) hereof, an Option is exercisable during an Optionee's lifetime only by the Optionee, provided, however, that in the event the Optionee is Disabled, such Options may be exercised by such Optionee's guardian or legal representative designated or appointed to conduct his or her business affairs under the terms described in Section 6(g) hereof.
(f)     Payment of Option Price and Taxes.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (i)   The purchase price for the Options being exercised must be paid in full at the time of exercise. Such price shall be paid in cash, in Common Stock of the Company having a Fair Market Value, as of the close of the business day immediately preceding the date of exercise, equal to the exercise price or the portion thereof being paid in Common Stock (provided that such Common Stock had been owned by the Optionee for at least six months), or as the Committee may otherwise approve.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (ii)   To enable the Company to meet any applicable federal (including FICA), state and other withholding tax requirements, an Optionee shall also be required to pay to the Company at the time of exercise the amount of tax which the Company determines is to be withheld. No share of Common Stock will be delivered to any Optionee until all such amounts have been paid. An Optionee may satisfy such withholding tax requirement by electing to have the Company withhold Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Optionee, or to deliver to the Company previously acquired Common Stock, which has a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is determined to be due (the "Tax Date") on the exercise of his or her Option which is at least equal to the amount required to be withheld. Such election must be made in writing at the time prescribed by the Committee prior to the Tax Date and shall be irrevocable. Elections by Optionees who are subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act shall be subject to the subsequent disapproval of the Committee and shall be subject to such further requirements of Rule 16b-3 or other law or regulation as may be applicable.  
[END TABLE]
(g)     Effect of Termination of Employment, Disability or Death. No Option may be exercised by an Optionee after the termination for any reason of his or her employment with the Company or an Affiliate, except that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (ii)   if such termination occurs by reason other than death, disability or cause, all portions of the Option then held by the Optionee which are exercisable at the date of termination shall continue to be exercisable by the Optionee for a three-month period subsequent to such termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (iii)   if such termination is for cause, the Optionee shall forfeit any portion of his or her Option which was unexercised or unexercisable at such termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (iv)   if the Optionee dies while Disabled during the six-month period described in clause (i) or dies during the three-month period described in clause (ii), all portions of his or her Option which were exercisable at the time of the Optionee's death shall continue to be exercisable for a six-month period subsequent to such date of death by the persons designated in the Optionee's will or his or her legal representatives.  
[END TABLE]
Transfer from employment with the Company to an Affiliate, from an Affiliate to the Company or from an Affiliate to another Affiliate shall not be treated as a termination of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option shall in no event be exercisable by the Optionee or his or her heirs or legal representatives after the Expiration Date.
(h)     Nontransferability of Options. Except as provided below and in Section 6(g) above, during an Optionee's lifetime, no Options under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Such Options shall only be exercisable by the Optionee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as provided by the Committee in an award agreement, Options may be transferred (in whole or in part in a form approved by the Company) by the Optionee to (i) the spouse, children or grandchildren of the Optionee ("Immediate Family Members"), (ii) a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of the Immediate Family Members and , if applicable, the Optionee, or (iii) a partnership in which such Immediate Family Members and, if applicable, the Optionee are the only partners. Following any such transfer, the Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Options immediately prior to the transfer. A transferee of an Option may not transfer the Option, except to an Immediate Family Member or the Optionee.
(i)     Outside Directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (i)   The Board of Directors may, from time to time, in its discretion, grant Options to one or more Outside Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may determine, which such terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with the other applicable provisions of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (ii)   The Option Price shall be the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (iii)   No Option may be exercised by an Outside Director after he or she ceases to be a director of the Company or an Affiliate by reason of death, Disability, resignation, removal or other reason, except that:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      (A)  if such cessation occurs by reason of the Outside Director's death or Disability, the portion of his or her Option which was exercisable on such cessation and the portion which would become exercisable had the Outside Director continued as a director until the third anniversary of his or her death or Disability, shall be exercisable for six months following such cessation (but not beyond the Expiration Date), except that if such cessation was due to Disability and the former Outside Director dies during such six-month period, such portions of his or her Option shall be exercisable for a six-month period following such death by the persons designated in the Outside Director's will or his or her legal representatives (but not beyond the Expiration Date); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (iv)   The provisions of the Plan shall apply to the Options granted to Outside Directors to the extent they are not inconsistent with the provisions of paragraphs (i) though (iii), above.  
[END TABLE]
7.     Amendment. The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, provided that (i) no such action shall adversely affect any rights or obligations with respect to any grants theretofore made hereunder, and (ii) any shareholder approval required by the securities laws, stock exchange or NYSE Amex rules or other applicable law or regulation is obtained. The Committee may amend the terms and conditions of outstanding Options, provided, however, that (x) no such amendment shall be adverse to the holder of an Option without the approval of such holder, and (y) the amended terms of the Option would be permitted under the Plan.
8.     Registration, Listing and Qualification of Shares. Each Option shall be subject to the requirement that if at any time the Committee shall determine that the registration, listing or qualification of the shares covered thereby upon any securities exchange or under any federal or state securities or other law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Option or the purchase of shares thereunder, no such Option may be exercised unless and until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any condition not acceptable to the Committee. Any person exercising an Option shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other applicable legal requirements.
9.     Adjustment for Change in Stock Subject to Plan. In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, reorganization, sale by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend, or other similar corporate change, such equitable adjustments may be made in the Plan and the Options granted hereunder as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate, including, if necessary, an adjustment in the number of shares and prices per share or the type or kind of shares or property applicable to Options then outstanding and in the number of shares which are reserved for issuance under the Plan. Any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
10.     No Rights to Options or Employment. No person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Option under the Plan. Receipt of an Option under the Plan shall not give a person any right to receive any other grant under the Plan. An Optionee shall have no rights to or interest in any Option except as set forth herein. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any person any right to be retained as an employee or director of the Company or any Affiliate.
11.     Rights as a Shareholder. An Optionee under the Plan shall have no rights as a holder of Common Stock with respect to Options granted hereunder, unless and until certificates for shares of Common Stock are issued to such Optionee.
12.     Other Actions. This Plan shall not restrict the authority of the Committee or of the Company to grant stock options, pursuant to other stock option plans, if any, to or with respect to any employee or other person.
13.     Costs and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 6(f) hereof with respect to taxes, the costs and expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Affiliates and shall not be charged to any grant or to any person receiving a grant.
14.     Plan Unfunded. The Plan shall be unfunded. Except for reserving a sufficient number of authorized shares Common Stock to the extent required by law to meet the requirements of the Plan, the Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any grant under the Plan.
15.     Governing Law. This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.
16.     Effective Date and Duration of Plan. This Plan shall be effective as of April 25, 2019, conditioned upon shareholder approval. No Option shall be granted under the Plan after April 24, 2029.
