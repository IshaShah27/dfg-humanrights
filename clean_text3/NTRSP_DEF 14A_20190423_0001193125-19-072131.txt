PROXY STATEMENT 
The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Northern Trust Corporation (the "Corporation") for use at the Corporation's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Tuesday, April 23, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"). On or about March 12, 2019, we began mailing or otherwise making available our proxy materials, including a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
A Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), for some of our stockholders we are providing access to our proxy materials via the Internet. The rules permit us to send a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to stockholders of record and beneficial owners. All stockholders have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice, www.proxyvote.com, or to request a printed set of proxy materials on this site or by calling toll-free 1-800-579-1639. Complete instructions for accessing the proxy materials on the Internet or requesting a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive all future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail on the website above or when voting electronically. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by e-mail will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our annual stockholders' meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
Who May Vote 
Record holders of the Corporation's common stock at the close of business on February 25, 2019 may vote at the Annual Meeting. On such date, the Corporation had 218,498,123 shares of common stock outstanding. 
You are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock that you owned of record at the close of business on February 25, 2019. The proxy card or Notice, as applicable, indicates the number of shares you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Voting Your Proxy 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote your shares promptly. 
If you are a "stockholder of record" (that is, you hold your shares of the Corporation's common stock in your own name), you may vote your shares by proxy using any of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● using the Internet site listed on the Notice or the proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● calling the toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● completing, signing, dating and returning your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
The Internet and telephone voting procedures set forth on the Notice and the proxy card are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to provide their voting instructions and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you should not return your proxy card. 
If you are a "beneficial owner," also known as a "street name" holder (that is, you hold your shares of the Corporation's common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee), you will receive from the record holder, in the form of a Notice or otherwise, voting instructions (including instructions, if any, on how to vote by Internet or telephone) that you must follow in order to have your shares voted at the Annual Meeting. Under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold securities on behalf of beneficial owners generally may vote on routine matters even if they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owners for whom they hold securities, but are not permitted to vote on nonroutine matters unless they have received such voting instructions. While the ratification of the appointment of the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm is considered to be a routine matter, each of the other matters to be presented to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting described in this Proxy Statement is considered to be a nonroutine matter. Therefore, if you fail to provide your specific voting instructions, your broker may only vote your shares on the ratification of the appointment of the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm. Consequently, it is important that you communicate your voting instructions by using any of the following methods so your vote can be counted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● using the Internet site listed on the voting instruction form;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● calling the toll-free telephone number listed on the voting instruction form; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● completing, signing, dating and returning your voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
If you own shares of common stock as a participant in The Northern Trust Company Thrift-Incentive Plan ("TIP") your proxy card will cover the shares credited to your plan account. The completed proxy card (or vote by Internet or telephone) will serve as your voting instructions to the TIP trustee. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 18, 2019. 
Whether you vote by Internet, telephone or mail, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you want your shares to be voted, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with the following recommendations of the Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Item 1      —      FOR the election of each nominee for director; 
 Item 2      —       FOR the approval, by an advisory vote, of the 2018 compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, as  disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC; 
 Item 3      —       FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm  for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; 
 Item 4      —       AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding additional disclosure of political contributions; and 
 Item 5      —       AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding the right of the Corporation's stockholders to call a special meeting of  stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
The proxy holders are authorized to vote as they shall determine in their sole discretion on any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
Revoking Your Proxy 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● sending a written notice of revocation to the Corporations Corporate Secretary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● submitting another signed proxy card with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● voting by Internet or telephone at a later date; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee and wish to revoke your proxy, you will need to contact that party to revoke your proxy. 
Voting in Person 
You may come to the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person by obtaining and submitting a ballot that will be provided at the meeting. However, if your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee in street name, to be able to vote at the meeting you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares, indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares at the close of business on February 25, 2019. 
Householding Information 
We are delivering only one Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement (or, as applicable, the Notice) to stockholders of record who share the same address unless they have notified us that they wish to continue receiving multiple copies. This practice, known as "householding," reduces duplicate mailings, saves printing and postage costs as well as natural resources and will not affect dividend check mailings. If you wish to receive separate copies of proxy materials, please contact Broadridge at 1-866-540-7095 or Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders who wish to receive a separate set of proxy materials now should contact Broadridge at the same telephone number or mailing address and the materials will be delivered to you promptly upon your request. 
If you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of our proxy materials or if you hold our stock in more than one account, and, in either case, you wish to receive only a single copy of such materials in the future, please contact Broadridge at the telephone number or mailing address above with the names in which all accounts are registered and the name of the account for which you wish to receive mailings. 
Quorum and Vote Required for Approval 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to be present in person or by proxy in order to establish a quorum. Abstentions and broker nonvotes, if any, will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. A "broker nonvote" will occur when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. As noted above, brokers, banks and other nominees generally cannot vote your shares on any of the matters to be presented to stockholders at the Annual Meeting described in this Proxy Statement, other than the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, without your specific instructions. Please return your proxy card or voting instruction form, as applicable, or vote by Internet or telephone so your vote can be counted. An inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting will tabulate all votes cast in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. In the event a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, we expect that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 
The following table indicates the vote required for approval of each item to be presented to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting and the effect of abstentions and broker nonvotes.

[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the Corporation's By-laws, a nominee for director in an uncontested election (such as this year's election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board) must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election at a meeting of stockholders to be elected. In contested elections, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast will be required to elect a director. The Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines require an incumbent director who fails to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in an uncontested election at a meeting of stockholders to submit his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. Such resignation will first be considered by the members of the Corporate Governance Committee (other than the tendering director, if applicable), who will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation after considering all factors deemed relevant by the Committee, including, without limitation, any stated reasons as to why stockholders did not support the director whose resignation has been tendered, the length of service and qualifications of such director, the director's contributions to the Corporation and the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board (other than the tendering director) will then act to accept or reject the Committee's recommendation no later than ninety days following the date of the stockholders' meeting after considering the factors considered by the Committee and such additional information and factors as the Board believes to be relevant. 
Solicitation of Proxies; Costs 
The Corporation will bear the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the materials in connection with this solicitation of proxies. In addition to mailing these materials, the Corporation's officers and other employees may, without being additionally compensated, solicit proxies personally and by mail, telephone or electronic communication. The Corporation will reimburse banks and brokers for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of stock or otherwise in connection with this solicitation. In addition, the Corporation has retained Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $13,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
ADMITTANCE TO THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Stockholders at the close of business on the record date, February 25, 2019, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend our Annual Meeting at our corporate headquarters on April 23, 2019 at 10:30 a.m., Central Time. Registration will begin at 9:30 a.m. Our corporate headquarters are located at 50 South La Salle Street (northwest corner of La Salle Street and Monroe Street) in Chicago, Illinois. 
In order to be admitted to the meeting, you must bring documentation showing that you owned the Corporation's common stock at the close of business on the record date, February 25, 2019. Acceptable documentation includes an admission ticket, a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials or any other proof of ownership of the Corporation's common stock at the close of business on February 25, 2019. A brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker reflecting your holdings at the close of business on February 25, 2019 is an example of such other proof of ownership. Your admission ticket is located on the top portion of the rear side of your proxy card or on the left side of your voting instruction form if your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee in street name. You will be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. For safety and security reasons, cameras and recording devices will not be permitted in the meeting. 
ITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Stockholders will be asked to elect thirteen directors at the Annual Meeting. Each of the thirteen nominees is currently serving as a director of the Corporation and its principal subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (the "Bank"). Included in the incumbent directors nominated for re-election are Marcy S. Klevorn and Siddharth N. "Bobby" Mehta, each of whom was appointed by the Board as a director of the Corporation, effective January 22, 2019, in accordance with the Corporation's By-laws and pursuant to the recommendation of the Corporation's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Lead Director. John W. Rowe will not be standing for re-election, as he will be retiring from service as a director effective upon the conclusion of his current term at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Rowe has served as a member of the Board since 2002. 
Each of the thirteen director nominees has consented to serve as a director if elected at the Annual Meeting. Each nominee elected as a director will serve until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until his or her successor is elected and qualified. If any nominee is unable to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, your proxy may be voted for the election of another nominee proposed by the Board or the Board may reduce the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting. 
As discussed further under "Corporate Governance—Director Nominations and Qualifications," in evaluating director nominees, the Corporate Governance Committee considers a variety of factors, including relevant business and industry experience; professional background; age; current employment; community service; other board service; and ethnic and gender diversity. Accordingly, the thirteen director nominees possess a wide variety of experience, qualifications and skills, which equip the Board with the collective expertise to perform its oversight function effectively. Each of the candidates also has a reputation for, and long record of, integrity and good business judgment; has experience in leadership positions with a high degree of responsibility; is free from conflicts of interest that could interfere with his or her duties to the Corporation and its stockholders; and is willing and able to make the necessary commitment of time and attention required for effective Board service. 
A summary of certain key experience, qualifications and skills represented by the nominees for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting, collectively, is set forth below.

Director Independence 
To be considered independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that a director has no relationship with the Corporation which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of the directors serving on the Board meet the criteria for "independence" under NASDAQ listing standards. 
To assist the Board in making its independence determinations, the Board has adopted categorical standards. Under these standards, the following persons shall not be considered "independent": 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a director who is or was an employee or executive officer of the Corporation, or whose Family Member (as defined below)  is or was an executive officer of the Corporation, at any time during the past three years;  
[END TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a director who receives or has received, or whose Family Member receives or has received, compensation from the  Corporation in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the past three years, other than director and committee fees, benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan or other  forms of nondiscretionary compensation; provided, however, that compensation received by a Family Member of a director for service as an employee (other than as an executive officer) of the Corporation need not be considered in determining  independence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a director who is, or whose Family Member is, a current partner of the Corporations outside auditor, or who was a  partner or employee of the Companys outside auditor who worked on the Corporations audit at any time during any of the past three years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a director of the Corporation who is, or has a Family Member who is, employed as an executive officer of another entity  where at any time during the past three years any of the executive officers of the Company serve on the compensation committee of such other entity; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a director who is, or whose Family Member is, a partner in, a controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of,  any organization to which the Corporation made, or from which the Corporation received, payments for property or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the recipients  consolidated gross revenue for that year, other than payments arising solely from investments in the Corporations securities or payments under nondiscretionary charitable contribution matching programs.  
[END TABLE]
"Family Member" means a person's spouse, parents, children and siblings, whether by blood, marriage or adoption, or anyone residing in such person's home. 
The Board has determined that each director serving during 2018 was, and each current director is, independent of the Corporation in accordance with the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines and categorical standards, except for Frederick H. Waddell, who retired from his role as Chairman of the Board effective January 23, 2019, and had previously served as the Corporation's CEO through December 31, 2017, and Mr. O'Grady, who currently serves as the Corporation's Chairman, President and CEO. 
In addition to the categorical standards, the Board considered that the Corporation or its subsidiaries provided financial services to each of its directors, or persons or entities affiliated with such directors, except for Mr. Tribbett, including trust and related services, brokerage services, investment management, asset servicing, asset management, credit services and other banking services. These transactions were undertaken in the ordinary course of business and were made on substantially the same terms (including interest rates and collateral for loan transactions) as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons not related to the Corporation or any affiliated entities involved in the transactions. None of these transactions involved more than the normal risk of collectability or presented other unfavorable features, and any extensions of credit to directors and executive officers of the Corporation were permitted under the provisions of Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). None of these transactions or any transactions in which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries sold or purchased products and services to or from any of the Corporation's directors, or persons or entities affiliated with its directors, were material to the Corporation or any affiliated entities involved in the transactions. With respect to Mr. Henderson, the Board also considered the related party transaction reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the Corporation's Related Person Transactions Policy described below. In each case, the Board determined that these relationships did not affect any director's ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. 
Related Person Transactions Policy 
The Board, through its Audit Committee, has adopted a written Related Person Transactions Policy to govern the review, approval, and ratification of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which the Corporation or its subsidiaries are party, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related persons have a direct or indirect material interest. "Related persons" means the Corporation's directors, nominees for director, executive officers, greater than five percent beneficial owners, members of their immediate family and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing their household. 
Any related person proposing to enter into a potential related party transaction with the Corporation or its subsidiaries must notify the Corporate Secretary of the facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction. If the Corporate Secretary finds that the transaction would constitute a related party transaction, it must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chair. In considering related person transactions, the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chair will consider all relevant facts and circumstances and approve only those related person transactions that are in, or otherwise not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Kathleen Finley, Mr. Henderson's daughter, has been employed by the Bank since 2005, currently serving as Chief Administrative Officer of the Wealth Management National Services team of the Bank. In such role, Ms. Finley earned compensation in excess of $120,000 in 2018, and received retirement, health and wellness benefits, all on comparable terms as those provided for other employees of the Bank. Pursuant to the Related Person Transactions Policy, our Audit Committee considers and approves Ms. Finley's employment on an annual basis. 
Executive Sessions 
The independent directors of the Corporation met in executive sessions separate from management six times during 2018. The Lead Director or, in his absence, another independent director designated by the Lead Director, presides at executive sessions of the independent directors. The standing committees of the Board also regularly held executive sessions during 2018. These sessions were led by the respective independent committee Chairs. 
Board Evaluations 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines charge the Corporate Governance Committee with oversight of the Board's annual self-evaluation to determine whether the Board and its standing committees are functioning effectively and in compliance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and applicable committee charters. Each year the Committee considers the process through which such self-evaluation is conducted to ensure it remains an efficient and effective means by which to assess, and foster the continual enhancement of, the Board. In recent years, this self-evaluation process has been led by the Lead Director, on behalf of the Corporate Governance Committee, through a series of one-on-one discussions with each of our directors, guided by a list of topics considered and approved by the Committee. The Lead Director then provides a summary of these discussions to the Board for its consideration in executive session. Each standing committee also meets in executive session to provide an opportunity to discuss the key takeaways from the evaluation process as they may apply to such committee's effectiveness. As a result of this evaluation process, certain enhancements have been made in recent years to Board and committee practices and meeting materials to further their effectiveness. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The current leadership structure of the Board consists of a combined Chairman and CEO position and a separate Lead Director who is appointed annually by the Corporation's independent directors. 
Effective January 1, 2018, Mr. O'Grady succeeded Mr. Waddell as CEO of the Corporation. In connection with this transition, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders for Mr. Waddell to continue to serve as Chairman of the Board to allow for continuity of Board leadership and strategic oversight and facilitate a smooth transition of the CEO role. The Board also determined that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders for Mr. Rowe, who had reached the retirement age for directors contemplated by the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, to continue to serve as the Corporation's Lead Director during this period of transition. 
Throughout 2018, Messrs. Waddell, Rowe and O'Grady worked closely together to ensure a successful transition of leadership of the Corporation. In connection with Mr. Waddell's retirement as Chairman of the Board effective January 23, 2019, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders to recombine the positions of Chairman and CEO, consistent with the Corporation's historical practice, with Mr. O'Grady serving in such combined role. Having one person serve as Chairman and CEO provides unified leadership and direction to the Corporation and strengthens the ability of the CEO to develop and implement strategic initiatives and respond effectively in crisis situations. 
Pursuant to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors of the Board appoint a Lead Director whenever the position of Chairman is not held by an independent director. The Lead Director's role with respect to the Corporation is a significant one, with primary responsibilities including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● approving Board meeting schedules and agendas to ensure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all Board  agenda items and overseeing the information provided to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● calling at any time deemed necessary or advisable by the Lead Director a special meeting of the Board or a special  executive session of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● adding items to the agenda of any regular or special meeting of the Board deemed necessary or advisable by the Lead  Director;  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
● presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● presiding at all regular and any special executive sessions of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● serving as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and CEO;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● conducting, by means of an interview with each director, including the Chairman and CEO, the Boards annual  self-evaluation of its performance and then providing a summary report to the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● being available for consultation and direct communication with major stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Rowe currently serves as the Corporation's Lead Director and has provided strong, independent leadership during his tenure in such role. The independent directors have selected Mr. Slark to succeed Mr. Rowe following Mr. Rowe's retirement from the Board upon the conclusion of his term at the Annual Meeting. 
Taking into account the prominence of the Lead Director role at the Corporation, the Board has determined that the Corporation's current Board leadership structure provides significant independent leadership of the Board and is most appropriate for the Corporation at this time. The Corporation has a strong independent Board, with all current directors except for Mr. O'Grady having been determined to be independent under NASDAQ listing standards and all standing committees of the Board except for the Executive Committee being composed solely of independent directors. The significant and meaningful responsibilities of the Corporation's independent directors, together with those of the Lead Director, also foster good governance practices and provide for substantial independent oversight of critical matters related to the Corporation. 
Risk Oversight 
General 
The Board provides oversight of risk management directly as well as through its Audit, Business Risk, Capital Governance and Compensation and Benefits Committees. The Board approves the Corporation's risk management framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement, which reflects the expectation that risk be consciously considered as part of the Corporation's strategic decisions and in its day-to-day activities. The Corporation actively monitors employees using programs, policies, and other tools that are designed to ensure that they work within established risk frameworks and limits. The Business Risk Committee assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, market and liquidity risk, fiduciary risk, operational risk, compliance risk and strategic risk. The Audit Committee provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk, while the Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees the development and operation of the incentive compensation program of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews management's assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of the incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with the safety and soundness of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether these incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation and Benefits Committee is required to have at least one member who is a member of the Business Risk Committee and at least one member who is a member of the Audit Committee. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees the processes and activities of the Corporation and its subsidiaries related to resolution planning and capital adequacy assessments, forecasting and stress testing, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to the linkage of the Corporation's material risks to the capital adequacy assessment and resolution planning processes. The charters for the Audit, Business Risk, Capital Governance and Compensation and Benefits Committees provide that the Committees may meet with the individuals who supervise day-to-day risk management responsibilities of the Corporation and other members of management, consultants or advisors, as each committee deems appropriate. 
Information Security and Technology Risk Oversight 
As a financial services company entrusted with the safeguarding of sensitive information, the Board believes that a strong information security and technology risk management program is crucial to the Corporation's success in an environment of increasing cyber threats. Accordingly, the Board and the Business Risk Committee play meaningful roles with respect to the oversight of information security and technology risk management at the Corporation. Specifically, in conjunction with its oversight of overall operational risk, the Business Risk Committee oversees management's actions to identify, assess, mitigate and remediate material issues related to information security and technology risk; annually reviews and approves the Corporation's information security and technology risk management policy and program; and receives 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
regular updates from management, including the Chief Information Security Officer, on the Corporation's information security and technology risk management program and cyber risk profile. The Board also plays a role with respect to the oversight of such risks, meeting periodically with management and third-party experts to discuss its role in crisis management and to review tabletop exercises designed to evaluate the Corporation's cybersecurity program. 
For a further description of the risk management policies and practices of the Corporation's management, including those related to information security and technology risk, see the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Management" in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Corporation has had Corporate Governance Guidelines in place since 2000. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines at least annually and recommends any changes to the Board for approval. The Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines embody many of the Corporation's long-standing practices and incorporate policies and procedures that strengthen its commitment to corporate governance best practices. A copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is available on the Corporation's website at www.northerntrust.com. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Board of the Corporation has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● promote honest and ethical conduct, including fair dealing and the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of  interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable public disclosure about the Corporation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules, codes and regulations wherever the Corporation does  business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● ensure the protection of the Corporations legitimate business interests; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● deter wrongdoing.  
[END TABLE]
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics satisfies applicable SEC and NASDAQ requirements and applies to all directors, officers (including the Corporation's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporation intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors and executive officers by posting such information on its website. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Corporation's website at www.northerntrust.com. 
Management Development and Succession Planning 
The Board is responsible for succession planning for the position of CEO. The Board, led by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, annually conducts a formal management development and succession planning review with respect to the position of the CEO and other senior officers. This review focuses on CEO succession planning, as well as developing internal candidates for advancement within the Corporation. The Compensation and Benefits Committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning management development and succession planning. These recommendations reflect the Board's annual management development and succession planning review, as well as Committee discussions with and without the CEO. The Corporate Governance Committee discusses succession planning in the event of the unexpected death, incapacity, or resignation of the CEO and recommends to the Board, after consultation with the Chairman of the Compensation and Benefits Committee, an appropriate successor under such circumstances. 
Director Nominations and Qualifications and Proxy Access 
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for considering, evaluating, and recommending candidates for director. The Committee will consider persons nominated by stockholders in accordance with the nomination procedures specified in the Corporation's By-laws and described further under "Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting" on page 69. Stockholders also may recommend candidates for director by following the procedures for communicating with directors described below under "Communications with the Board and Independent Directors." 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
In its evaluation of director candidates, including persons recommended by stockholders, the Corporate Governance Committee considers the factors specified in the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines to ensure the Board has a diversity of perspectives and backgrounds, including the nature of the expertise and experience required for the performance of the duties of a director of a corporation engaged in the Corporation's business and such matters as relevant business and industry experience, professional background, age, current employment, community service and other board service. The Committee also considers the ethnic and gender diversity of the Board in assessing candidates. The Committee seeks to identify as candidates for director persons with a reputation for, and record of, integrity and good business judgment who: (i) have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility and are leaders in the organizations with which they are affiliated; (ii) are free from conflicts of interest that could interfere with a director's duties to the Corporation and its stockholders; and (iii) are willing and able to make the necessary commitment of time and attention required for effective Board service. The Committee also takes into account a candidate's level of financial literacy, and monitors the mix of skills and experience of the directors in order to ensure the Board has the necessary collective expertise to perform its oversight function effectively. Following its evaluation process, the Committee recommends director nominees to the full Board, and the Board makes the final determination of director nominees based on its consideration of the Committee's recommendation. 
The Corporation's By-laws also include a proxy access right, providing eligible stockholders the right to include, along with the candidates nominated by the Board, their own nominees for election to the Board in the Corporation's proxy materials. This proxy access right permits any stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, who has maintained continuous qualifying ownership of 3% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock for at least the previous three years, and continues to own the required common stock through the date of the applicable annual meeting, to include in the Corporation's proxy materials such stockholder's own nominees for election to the Board constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the total number of directors, provided that such stockholder and its nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Corporation's By-laws. 
Stockholder Engagement 
The Corporation recognizes the importance of engaging with stockholders and other key constituents. Open and constructive dialogue with stockholders helps further their understanding of our performance and strategies and allows us to receive direct feedback on issues relating to the Corporation. Accordingly, it is the Corporation's long-standing practice to engage proactively and routinely with stockholders throughout the year. This practice continued in 2018, with our CEO and/or CFO engaging with stockholders representing approximately 45% of our outstanding shares regarding matters pertaining to the Corporation's performance, strategies and governance. 
Communications with the Board and Independent Directors 
Stockholders and other interested persons may communicate with any of the Corporation's directors, including the Lead Director or the independent directors as a group, by writing a letter addressed to the applicable director(s), c/o Northern Trust Corporation, 50 South La Salle Street, M-9, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Any stockholder or other interested person who has a particular concern regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or other audit matters that he or she wishes to bring to the attention of the Audit Committee may communicate those concerns to the Audit Committee or its Chairman, using the address indicated above. The Corporation's Corporate Secretary will review and forward communications to the appropriate member or members of the Board. The Corporate Secretary need not forward or retain any communications determined to be mass mailings, routine solicitations for business or contributions, or communications determined not to be relevant to the performance of the duties of the Board. 
Securities Transactions Policy and Procedures and Policy Against Hedging 
Our Securities Transactions Policy and Procedures prohibits directors, employees, including our named executive officers, and certain of their family members from purchasing or selling any type of security, whether issued by us or another company, while such persons are aware of material nonpublic information relating to the issuer of the security and from providing such material nonpublic information to any person who may trade while aware of such information. This policy also prohibits directors, employees, and certain of their family members from engaging in short selling, margining, pledging or hypothecating the Corporation's securities, and from trading in options, warrants, puts, calls or similar instruments on the Corporation's securities.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Corporation's directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Corporation's stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of any equity securities of the Corporation. Based solely on the Corporation's review of the reports that have been filed by or on behalf of such reporting persons in this regard and written representations from such reporting persons that no other reports were required, the Corporation believes that all reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were made on a timely basis during or with respect to 2018, except (i) one form 4 filed for Dean M. Harrison which related to the purchase of 18 shares and 1,000 shares, as well as the sale of 2 shares, all held by him indirectly, on February 25, 2015, December 15, 2015, and May 1, 2017, respectively; and (ii) one form 4 filed for Wilson Leech related to the withholding of 729 shares on July 15, 2018, and 1,055 shares on July 21, 2018, in each case as payment of tax liabilities upon the vesting of certain restricted stock units.

ITEM 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC, the Corporation is required to include in this Proxy Statement a separate resolution, subject to an advisory vote, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement (commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote). In a nonbinding, advisory vote on the frequency of Say-on-Pay votes held at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders voted in favor of conducting Say-on-Pay votes annually. In light of this result, and other factors considered by the Board, the Corporation will continue to hold Say-on-Pay votes on an annual basis. Accordingly, the Board is requesting that stockholders vote FOR approval of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to the Corporation's named executive officers, as disclosed in its Proxy Statement dated March 12, 2019, pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the Corporation. Although the vote is nonbinding, the Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and, consistent with past practice, will consider the outcome of the vote when determining compensation policies and making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
The Corporation's executive compensation program and the framework used in evaluating and making 2018 compensation decisions for our named executive officers are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that begins on page 23 of this Proxy Statement. 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

Effective January 1, 2018, Mr. O'Grady succeeded Mr. Waddell as CEO of the Corporation. In connection with this transition, Mr. Waddell continued to serve as Chairman of the Board to allow for continuity of Board leadership and strategic oversight and facilitate a smooth transition of the CEO role. Upon Mr. Waddell's retirement from his role as Chairman of the Board effective January 23, 2019, the Board recombined the positions of Chairman and CEO, with Mr. O'Grady now serving in the combined role. Further discussion with respect to this leadership transition is set forth in the "Board Leadership Structure" section beginning on page 16. Additionally, Ms. Schreuder retired from her role as Chief Operating Officer on August 31, 2018. As discussed further under "2018 Performance Considerations" below, following her retirement Ms. Schreuder provided certain consulting services to the Corporation through December 31, 2018. The titles for Mr. O'Grady, Mr. Waddell, Ms. Schreuder and each of our other named executive officers provided throughout this Proxy Statement, including the table above, reflect their current roles. 
Executive Summary 
2018 Financial Performance 
In 2018, we remained focused on the three pillars of our financial strategy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Achieve Growth across the business, as demonstrated by continued growth in revenue and trust, investment and  other servicing fees.  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Improve Productivity and Profitability, as demonstrated by the decrease in our noninterest expense as a  percentage of our trust, investment and other servicing fees, which in turn resulted in improvements in pre-tax margin, pre-tax income and net income. We remain focused  on efforts to continue to improve our productivity and profitability, including through our Value for Spend expense management initiative.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Increase Stockholder Returns, as demonstrated by improvement in our return on equity and increases in dividends.  During 2018, we returned an aggregate $1.4 billion in capital to common stockholders through quarterly dividends and the repurchase of 9.0 million shares.  
[END TABLE]
We achieved these financial results while continuing to maintain strong capital ratios, with all ratios exceeding those required for classification as "well capitalized" under federal bank regulatory capital requirements. 
Key Strategic Achievements 
Execution on our strategies also was demonstrated through various strategic achievements, including:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Guiding Principles for Executive Compensation 
Our compensation philosophy is to attract, reward and retain talent, including executive-level talent, who will contribute to our long-term success. With the goals of solid long-term financial performance and creating long-term stockholder value, our executive compensation program and compensation decisions are framed by the four guiding principles described below.

[END TABLE]
Risk Management 
A key objective of our compensation program is to ensure that the incentive compensation design does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking. We have considered our incentive compensation program in light of the guidance provided by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") with respect to sound incentive compensation policies at financial institutions. We believe our compensation arrangements are consistent with our safety and soundness and appropriately aligned with our overall risk profile. 
To reinforce the important role of effective risk management in our compensation framework, 65% of long-term incentive awards to named executive officers for 2018 performance were provided in performance stock units. Performance stock units, which contain meaningful performance targets for named executive officers and are payable in shares if those targets are attained, discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior because they can only be earned by attaining long-term performance goals and because the value of the award is less susceptible than stock options to short-term fluctuations in share value. All long-term incentive awards vest over a multi-year period and have an inherent risk adjustment factor based on changes in the value of our common stock. All long-term incentive compensation arrangements for named executive officers from February 14, 2012, through February 20, 2017, included forfeiture and recoupment provisions. On February 20, 2017, we adopted a Policy on Recoupment containing similar forfeiture and recoupment provisions applicable to long-term incentive compensation arrangements entered into on or after such date, which was subsequently amended to apply to all short-term incentive compensation amounts for named executive officers made on or after February 19, 2018, as well. Further information with respect to these forfeiture and recoupment provisions for our named executive officers can be found under "Other Compensation Practices—Forfeiture and Recoupment." 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews management's assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of our incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing risk-taking incentives that 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
are consistent with the safety and soundness of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether our incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. In connection with the Committee's assessment, the Corporation's Chief Risk Officer presents an annual incentive compensation risk performance review, discussing his observations and assessments of risk performance for the performance year for the Corporation and each of its significant businesses. The Committee will continue to monitor and, if necessary, revise our incentive compensation program to ensure that it continues to balance appropriately the objectives of stockholders, the needs of the business and risk concerns. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation and Benefits Committee is required to have at least one member who is a member of the Business Risk Committee and at least one member who is a member of the Audit Committee. This overlap in composition is intended to ensure that compensation decisions reflect the input of the Audit and Business Risk Committees. 
Executive Compensation Program Elements 
The table below provides a brief description of the elements of our compensation program and how each element helps address our guiding principles for executive compensation.

Additional information with respect to each of the four principal elements of our compensation program can be found beginning on page 33. 
Determining Awards 
Role of the Board of Directors 
The full Board of Directors sets the compensation of our CEO and our Chairman. In determining the appropriate level of compensation for the individuals in these roles, the Board gives substantial weight to the recommendations of the Compensation and Benefits Committee, but retains ultimate oversight and responsibility for such compensation decisions. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Role of the Compensation and Benefits Committee 
During its February meeting each year, the Compensation and Benefits Committee determines the appropriate level of compensation for all executive officers. The Committee considers all elements of our executive compensation program holistically rather than each compensation element individually, and makes executive compensation decisions after careful review and analysis of financial and nonfinancial performance information, as well as historical and market compensation data. 
The Committee has the discretion to determine compensation in the context of individual performance in nonfinancial areas that are important to long-term growth and the enhancement of stockholder value. This flexibility allows the Committee to modify individual incentive payouts and long-term incentive awards to reflect: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● our business model and strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● prevailing market trends;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● evolution in the financial and regulatory environment; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● risk management objectives.  
[END TABLE]
As discussed under "2018 Performance Considerations" beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement, in considering the compensation for the roles of Chairman and CEO, the Committee also evaluates the performance of the individual(s) serving in such roles against established objectives for the year to which such compensation relates. The Committee shares this evaluation with the Board in order for the Board to set the compensation of the individual(s) serving in such roles. 
Role of the CEO 
The CEO presents the Compensation and Benefits Committee with recommendations on the total compensation for each of our other executive officers. These recommendations reflect performance against the past year's performance expectations, a mix of financial and nonfinancial performance factors, which are not formulaically weighted or scored, and competitive market data. These recommendations also reflect each of the other executive officer's performance with regard to business risks and individual adherence to risk and compliance policies and procedures. The Committee gives substantial weight to the recommendations of the CEO, but retains the ultimate oversight and responsibility to set compensation for all executive officers, except for the Chairman and the CEO, whose compensation is set by the Board with consideration given to the recommendations of the Committee. 
Role of Human Resources 
The Human Resources function provides materials to assist the Compensation and Benefits Committee in making executive compensation decisions, including current and historical compensation data for executive officers. Our Chief Human Resources Officer attends and participates in all Committee meetings. The Human Resources function also assists the CEO in formulating his compensation recommendations for all other executive officers. 
Role of the Compensation and Benefits Committee's Independent Compensation Consultant 
In July 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"), a nationally recognized executive compensation consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant. Prior to July, Compensation Advisory Partners LLC ("CAP") advised the Compensation and Benefits Committee as its independent compensation consultant. The Committee confers with its independent compensation consultant to ensure that decisions and actions are consistent with stockholders' long-term interests and compensation-related best practices within the financial services industry. The Committee also references market data provided by its independent compensation consultant when considering compensation for executive officers. At least one representative of the Committee's independent compensation consultant attended all meetings of the Committee during 2018. The Committee's independent compensation consultant provides insights into compensation trends and market practices, presents views on the compensation proposed by the Committee and participates in Committee meeting discussions and executive sessions. The Corporation does not engage the Committee's independent compensation consultant for additional services outside of providing executive compensation consulting to the Committee. The Committee conducted assessments of potential conflicts of interest and independence issues with respect to each of Meridian and CAP pursuant to applicable SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards and no such conflicts or issues were identified. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Use of Peer Group and Market Data 
To help to inform its decision-making, the Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews peer group data regarding competitive pay levels in the market place. The peer group utilized by the Committee consists of the Corporation's two most comparable trust and custody peers—The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and State Street Corporation—as well as certain other banking, wealth management and asset management firms similar to the Corporation in certain respects, but not necessarily representing direct business competitors. This peer group, reflected below, was originally developed by the Committee, working with CAP and management's executive compensation consultant, Towers Watson, in 2015. In July 2017, the Compensation and Benefits Committee, working with CAP, reviewed the peer group and determined that it continues to provide the Committee with a representative view of the market for executive talent and reflects our business mix, complexity and global footprint. Data related to this peer group was used when setting 2018 and 2019 base salaries and determining the size of short-term annual cash incentive awards and long-term incentive grants made in 2019 and 2018 based on 2018 and 2017 performance, respectively.

When making compensation decisions, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considers how the recommended compensation levels will compare to the median compensation for comparable positions among the peer group companies. The Committee also considers market data for comparable positions reported in certain financial services industry surveys. However, the Committee recognizes that the compensation levels may vary from market median compensation levels based on our performance or specific individual circumstances, including the executive's tenure in the role, the nature of the responsibilities of the executive and the executive's individual performance. 
The Committee regularly reviews the composition of the Corporation's peer group to ensure that it continues to provide the Committee with a representative view of the market for executive talent and will make updates, as appropriate, based on changes within the peer group companies, industry consolidation and the Corporation's own business mix, complexity and global footprint. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Prior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") limited the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to "covered employees" (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code) of the Corporation, unless the compensation satisfied an exception, such as the exception for performance-based compensation. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted, which, among other things, repealed the performance-based compensation exception and expanded the definition of covered employee. The changes to Section 162(m) are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, all compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1.0 million paid to covered employees (as defined in the Act) during the 2018 tax year and each year thereafter will no longer be deductible by the Corporation, except with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. For and prior to the 2017 taxable year, our covered employees included the CEO and other named executive officers (but not the CFO) who were executive officers as of the last day of our fiscal year. For 2018 and thereafter, our covered employees will generally include anyone who (i) was the CEO or CFO at any time during the fiscal year, (ii) was one of the other named executive officers who were serving as executive officers as of the last day of the fiscal year or (iii) was a covered employee for any prior fiscal year after 2016. As was the case prior to the enactment of the Act, the Committee will continue to monitor issues concerning the deductibility of executive compensation. Since corporate objectives may not always be consistent with the requirements for deductibility, the Committee may, when it deems appropriate, enter into compensation arrangements under which payments will not be deductible for tax purposes. 
2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Our 2017 named executive officer compensation was approved on an advisory basis by our stockholders at our April 17, 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Approximately 97% of the votes present and entitled to vote at the meeting, 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
including abstentions, supported approval of 2017 named executive officer compensation. Although such advisory votes are nonbinding, the Board reviews and thoughtfully considers the voting results when determining compensation policies and making future compensation decisions for named executive officers. Additionally, as mentioned under "Stockholder Engagement" beginning on page 19 of this Proxy Statement, it is our practice to engage proactively and routinely with stockholders throughout the year to help further their understanding of our performance and strategies and to allow us to receive direct feedback on issues relating to the Corporation. The decisions made by the Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee with respect to compensation in 2018 reflect the Board and the Committee's belief, based on the results of the advisory vote on 2017 named executive officer compensation and our ongoing dialogue with stockholders, that our stockholders generally support our overall executive compensation program. 
2018 Compensation Decisions and Design 
2018 Performance Considerations 
In determining total compensation for the named executive officers, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considered the Corporation's 2018 financial performance, the performance of the Corporation's leadership team as a whole, and how well each officer performed in his or her role. Further detail with respect to performance factors for each of the named executive officers is set forth below. 
Michael G. O'Grady 
As the Corporation's CEO for the entirety of 2018, Mr. O'Grady was primarily responsible for leading the development and implementation of our corporate strategies; managing and developing our senior leaders; and embodying our guiding principles of service, expertise and integrity. To determine Mr. O'Grady's 2018 compensation, the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the Board considered the performance of the Corporation under Mr. O'Grady's leadership, the performance of the Corporation's leadership team as a whole, and how well Mr. O'Grady fulfilled his specific individual performance objectives. Mr. O'Grady's individual performance objectives were set in February 2018 at the direction of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the full Board. In January 2019, the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the Board evaluated Mr. O'Grady's performance against the individual objectives established in February 2018. The Compensation and Benefits Committee and the Board considered not only whether Mr. O'Grady satisfied each of his individual performance objectives, but also how he satisfied such objectives. 
Mr. O'Grady's achievements and contributions to the Corporation's performance in 2018, many of which correlate to the individual performance objectives established for Mr. O'Grady in February 2018, are reflected in:

Jana R. Schreuder 
As the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer until her retirement on August 31, 2018, Ms. Schreuder was primarily responsible for business operations and enabling the Corporation's businesses to grow faster, more efficiently and more profitably. To determine Ms. Schreuder's 2018 compensation for her service as the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considered how well Ms. Schreuder fulfilled these responsibilities through the date of her retirement. Following her retirement, the Corporation entered into a consulting agreement with Ms. Schreuder to facilitate the transition of her responsibilities and allow the Corporation to continue to benefit from her extensive experience with respect to its businesses and operations during such period of transition. Pursuant to such agreement, Ms. Schreuder provided certain consulting services and contributed to various special projects at the direction of the Corporation's President and CEO through December 31, 2018, for which she received aggregate fees of $1.5 million.

Base Salary 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee believes that base salaries should provide a fixed level of annual income consistent with an executive officer's position and responsibilities, competitive pay practices and internal equity among executive officers. 
The Committee uses discretion in determining base salaries, considering the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● targeted base salary levels that balance market pay practices with internal equity principles;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● experience and qualifications of the individual executive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the executive officers tenure in the position or a position of similar level;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● significant changes in assignment or scope of responsibility; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● individual performance over the prior year relative to established goals and expectations for the position.   
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For new and recently promoted executives, the Committee's approach is to increase incrementally base salary to the appropriate target pay level as the executive officer gains experience and tenure in the new position. 
Effective January 1, 2018, Mr. O'Grady's base salary increased from $800,000 to $900,000 in conjunction with his appointment as CEO. In February 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee approved an increase in Mr. Cherecwich's 2018 base salary from $600,000 to $625,000. No other action was taken in 2018 to increase the base salary of any other named executive officer. 
Short-Term Annual Cash Incentive 
Annual cash incentives provide an opportunity for our executive officers to receive additional cash compensation based on our financial performance, as well as each executive officer's individual performance. The overall annual bonus pool is funded based on a targeted percentage of pre-tax income. Pursuant to the terms of the Corporation's Management Performance Plan, under which the annual cash incentive awards to our named executive officers are made, the maximum funding for each officer's annual cash incentive award is a percentage of the consolidated net income generated by us in the applicable year. The annual cash incentive maximums for our named executive officers are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual cash incentives for the Chairman and the CEO may not exceed 0.6% of consolidated net income;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual cash incentives for the President (if not serving as CEO) and Chief Operating Officer may not exceed 0.4% of  consolidated net income;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual cash incentives for the other named executive officers may not exceed 0.3% of consolidated net income; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● no annual incentives can be paid in the absence of positive net income.  
[END TABLE]
The final determination of individual annual cash incentives is not tied to any specific formula, rather the process that the Compensation and Benefits Committee uses to determine incentives relies on a discretionary assessment of quantitative and qualitative performance criteria for Northern Trust as a whole, specific businesses and individual executive officers. In setting 2018 short-term annual cash incentives in February 2019, the Committee gave consideration to our overall performance, the individual executive officer's performance, internal equity principles and peer group compensation levels. Factors with respect to performance taken into consideration included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our overall financial performance, with a focus on key metrics, including:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Pre-tax income relative to plan and prior year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Return on equity.

● Risk management.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the performance considerations discussed under "2018 Performance Considerations" above, in February 2019, the named executive officers were awarded the 2018 short-term annual cash incentives shown in the table below. Prior-year annual cash incentive awards are also provided for comparative purposes.

 Jana R.  Schreuder   Former Chief Operating Officer (Retired August 2018)      —        1,000,000   
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Committee believes that its use of discretion in setting short-term annual cash incentives for the named executive officers is appropriate as it allows the Committee to assess performance holistically across multiple dimensions of performance; provides for a year-end assessment of how challenging the operating environment was and how well we performed relative to our direct peers; and ensures that the Committee has the ability to adjust incentives for how results were achieved (i.e., degree of risk taken, sustainability of results). 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
Long-term incentive compensation is the most significant element of overall compensation and is designed to reward the performance of executive officers over time. Long-term incentive awards made in February 2019 for performance in 2018 were granted to named executive officers as a mix consisting of 65% performance stock units and 35% restricted stock units. 
The table below summarizes the long-term incentive awards established by the Compensation and Benefits Committee for our named executive officers in February 2019 and February 2018. In establishing long-term incentive award opportunities for our named executive officers, consideration is given to each executive's performance, his or her potential for future contributions to the organization and internal equity principles. As discussed under "Total Direct Compensation for 2018 and Overall Pay Mix" below, changes in the roles and responsibilities of our named executive officers are reflected in their long-term incentive awards to the extent such changes impact a named executive officer's potential for future contributions to the organization.

Performance Stock Units. Performance stock units make up 65% of the long-term incentive award opportunity provided to our named executive officers for performance in 2018 and are generally the largest portion of the total compensation mix for our named executive officers. Our performance stock units are earned based on our average return on equity performance over a three-year period relative to pre-established goals. Return on equity is the primary financial performance metric used internally and externally to assess our long-term performance. The following tables illustrate the vesting requirements for the performance stock unit grants to named executive officers in 2018 and 2019.

[END TABLE]
As it is possible that there will be no payout under the performance stock units, these awards are completely "at-risk" compensation. Since performance stock units were reintroduced as an element of the Corporation's long-term incentive compensation program in 2012, the average annual rate of return on equity required for awards to become 100% vested has doubled from 8.0% to 16.0%. These increases emphasize the "at-risk" element of these awards. 
On January 22, 2019, shares of common stock underlying performance stock units granted in 2016 were distributed. The number of shares distributed was equal to 113.8% of target based on the Corporation's adjusted average annual return on equity of 12.8% during the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018, as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
In determining this average annual return on equity, the Committee adjusted the Corporation's 2018 net income to exclude the effect of certain net tax benefits resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and certain other one-time charges in accordance with the terms and conditions of the performance stock units. No such adjustments were made to the net income for any other year within the three-year performance period. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the net income and return on equity for each year within the three-year performance period applicable to performance stock units granted in 2016 prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to the adjusted net income and adjusted return on equity determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units are an effective tool to align executives with stockholder interests by making them owners of our stock. Another critical aspect of our restricted stock unit design is that they generally vest ratably over four years, which is effective in helping us to retain critical talent and ensuring that executives have significant outstanding unvested equity value over the course of their careers.

Total Direct Compensation for 2018 and Overall Pay Mix 
The table below provides a comprehensive summary of each named executive officer's total direct compensation for 2018 and 2017 and may be useful in reviewing key incentive compensation decisions made for 2018 and 2017 performance. It should be noted that certain amounts in the table below are different than the amounts in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. The most significant difference is that the long-term incentive awards included in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 and 2017 were granted in February 2018 and February 2017, respectively, for 2017 and 2016 performance, while the awards shown below for 2018 and 2017 were granted in February 2019 and February 2018, 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
respectively, for 2018 and 2017 performance. It also should be noted that the long-term incentive awards shown below reflect consideration of each named executive officer's performance in the year prior to grant, as well as his or her potential for future contributions to the organization.

(1) Represents the applicable named executive officer's salary, as determined in February 2018 and 2017, respectively, except for Mr. O'Grady's 2018 base salary, which was increased in October 2017, effective January 1, 2018, in connection with his appointment as CEO of the Corporation. 
(2) Represents the short-term incentive award received by the applicable named executive officer in February 2019 for 2018 performance and February 2018 for 2017 performance, respectively. 
(3) Although Mr. Cherecwich was not a named executive officer in 2017, his 2017 total direct compensation is provided for comparative purposes. 
(4) Ms. Schreuder's 2018 salary is prorated through her retirement on August 31, 2018. Other compensation includes amounts paid for certain consulting services that Ms. Schreuder provided to the Corporation following her retirement and for unused accrued vacation time. 
The increase in Mr. O'Grady's total direct compensation for 2018 and decrease in Mr. Waddell's total direct compensation for 2018 reflect the changes in their respective roles and responsibilities, with Mr. O'Grady succeeding Mr. Waddell as CEO of the Corporation effective as of January 1, 2018, and Mr. Waddell continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board until his retirement from such role on January 23, 2019. The increase in the short-term incentive compensation granted to each other named executive officer in February 2019, aside from Ms. Schreuder, who retired from the role of Chief Operating Officer as of August 31, 2018, reflects the strength of the Corporation's financial performance in 2018, as well as each officer's individual performance in his role during 2018. Further information with respect to the performance factors impacting each named executive officer's compensation for 2018 can be found under "2018 Performance Considerations" beginning on page 30. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The chart below illustrates the pay mix of the compensation awarded to Mr. O'Grady for 2018 performance. Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy and his appointment to serve as CEO, effective January 1, 2018, Mr. O'Grady's pay mix heavily emphasizes incentive compensation, with approximately 68% of the total direct compensation awarded to Mr. O'Grady delivered in long-term incentive compensation. Our long-term incentive mix emphasizes performance-based pay, with 65% of the long-term incentives being awarded in performance stock units earned based on our return on equity over a three-year period and 35% being awarded in restricted stock units. 
Other Compensation Practices 
Retirement, Health and Welfare Benefits 
Retirement benefits are generally designed with our entire workforce in mind and are not specifically structured for the executive officers. The design of our retirement program for employees is market competitive. We target total retirement benefits at approximately the median level of retirement benefits of peer group companies. Our executive officers also participate in our health and welfare benefits, including medical, retiree medical, dental, disability and life insurance programs, on the same terms as other employees. 
Severance Benefits and Employment Security Arrangements 
We provide a severance plan to provide reasonable benefits to U.S. employees who are involuntarily terminated without cause due to a reduction in force, job elimination or similar reasons specified in the severance plan. We believe that the availability of severance benefits allows us to compete with our peer group companies in attracting and retaining talent. Executive officers in the United States participate in this plan on the same terms as all other similarly situated employees and may be eligible to receive severance benefits that include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a lump sum payment of two weeks of base salary for each year of completed service up to but less than 25 years, or 52  weeks of base salary for 25 years or more of completed service to us; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a COBRA subsidy based on their length of service to help cover the costs of continuation coverage under the  employers medical and dental plans, full vesting under TIP, the Northern Trust Corporation Supplemental Thrift-Incentive Plan (Supplemental TIP), The Northern Trust Company Pension Plan (the Pension Plan), and the  Northern Trust Corporation Supplemental Pension Plan (the Supplemental Pension Plan), enhanced early retirement eligibility under the Pension Plan for employees who have reached age 54 with 14 years of credited service and outplacement  assistance.  
[END TABLE]
These benefits are contingent upon execution of a release, waiver and settlement agreement with us. These benefits are also limited to the lesser of two times the applicable executive officer's salary or two times the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17). In 2017 and 2018, these limits effectively capped benefits at $540,000 and $550,000, respectively. Further, these severance payments would be reduced by any severance payments made under employment security agreements or any other benefit plan, program or individual contract. 
In addition to the severance benefits discussed above, we have entered into employment security agreements with certain executive officers of the Corporation, including each named executive officer currently employed with the Corporation. The purpose of these agreements is to provide an executive with sufficient security to remain focused on his or her responsibilities during and after a change in control transaction without undue concern for his or her personal circumstances. In 2017, we issued to each of the executive officers party to an employment security agreement a termination notice with 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
respect to the agreement. Under the terms of the employment security agreements, such a notice must be provided at least two years in advance of the effective date of such termination. Following the effective date of the termination of the employment security agreements on June 1, 2019, each named executive officer remaining employed with the Corporation at that time will become a participant in the Northern Trust Corporation Executive Change in Control Severance Plan ("Change in Control Plan"), providing participants with certain benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years following a change in control. We believe the employment security agreements and Change in Control Plan are critical to our ability to attract and retain key executives in light of the fact that all named executive officers are employed at will and change in control benefits for executives are a standard element of a competitive compensation program at peer group companies. 
Further discussion with respect to our employment security agreements and Change in Control Plan, including disclosure of potential change in control benefits payable to each named executive officer, assuming a change in control of the Corporation and termination of employment on December 31, 2018, is set forth in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or a Change in Control of the Corporation" section beginning on page 54 of this Proxy Statement. 
Perquisites 
We provide a limited number of perquisites intended to assist executive officers in the performance of their duties on behalf of the Corporation. We provide financial consulting and tax return preparation services and personal use of company automobiles as perquisites to our executive officers. If circumstances warrant and if pre-approved by our CEO, we permit personal use of private aircraft on a limited basis. We also reimburse executive officers for the payment of personal income taxes in connection with the use of company vehicles in certain circumstances and taxable relocation expenses. The Compensation and Benefits Committee periodically reviews the types and costs of perquisites to ensure they remain aligned with our compensation philosophy. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Supporting our guiding principle of alignment with stockholders' interests, we have a long-standing practice of emphasizing stock ownership and maintaining robust stock ownership guidelines for named executive officers. In 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee worked with its independent compensation consultant to refine these guidelines and the methodology pursuant to which certain forms of stock ownership are counted toward satisfying the minimum ownership levels. The Committee believes the revised guidelines and the methodology for calculating ownership better align with market practice while retaining the cultural importance of executive officer equity ownership at the Corporation and the alignment of the interests of executive officers with those of the Corporation's stockholders. The stock ownership guidelines to which the Corporation's executive officers currently are subject are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chairman /  CEO      8x   
 President      5x   
 Chief Operating Officer  / Chief Financial Officer / Business Unit Heads      4x   
 Chief Accounting  Officer      1x   
 Other Executive Officers      3x   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  *  If an individual holds multiple positions subject to these stock ownership guidelines, he or she will be subject to the  highest stock ownership guideline associated with his or her positions.    
[END TABLE]
Each executive officer is expected to meet his or her respective minimum ownership level by the fifth anniversary of becoming an executive officer or assuming a new position with a higher stock ownership guideline. If the minimum ownership level requirement is not met upon or at any time after such date, he or she will be required to retain 100% of the net, after-tax shares received upon vesting of equity awards or stock option exercises until the minimum is met. As of December 31, 2018, each of our named executive officers met or exceeded our stock ownership guidelines. 
Forfeiture and Recoupment 
All awards granted to named executive officers since 2012 under our long-term incentive compensation program are subject to forfeiture or recoupment in the event of misconduct resulting in a restatement of the Corporation's financial statements and certain other types of misconduct. Such awards also are subject to forfeiture and recoupment provisions relating to "ex-post" risk, meaning risk resulting from the recipient's inappropriate risk-taking that does not materialize until after the performance period in which such inappropriate risk-taking takes place. Additionally, since 2013, all restricted stock 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
units awarded to named executive officers are subject to forfeiture or recoupment if it is determined that the applicable named executive officer has engaged in inappropriate risk-taking which resulted in certain events deemed to be "significant risk outcomes." An analysis of significant risk outcomes is completed annually to determine if such significant risk outcomes were tied to inappropriate risk-taking. The results of this analysis are reviewed by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. 
With respect to long-term incentive compensation awards made prior to February 21, 2017, the foregoing forfeiture and recoupment requirements are contained in the individual award agreements between the Corporation and our named executive officers. Forfeiture and recoupment requirements applicable to long-term incentive compensation awards made on or after such date are contained in the Policy on Recoupment adopted by the Compensation and Benefits Committee on February 20, 2017. Effective February 19, 2018, the Policy on Recoupment was amended to provide that awards under our short-term incentive compensation programs made on or after such date are also subject to each of the forfeiture and recoupment requirements described above. 
Hedging and Pledging Policy 
We maintain a Securities Transactions Policy and Procedures which, among other things, prohibits directors, employees, and certain of their family members from engaging in short selling, margining, pledging or hypothecating our securities, and from trading in options, warrants, puts, calls or similar instruments on our securities. 
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee is responsible for providing oversight of the compensation of the directors and executive officers of the Corporation. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Proxy Statement.

(1) Titles in this column reflect current positions. Mr. O'Grady succeeded Mr. Waddell as CEO of the Corporation, effective January 1, 2018. Following such date, Mr. Waddell continued to serve as Chairman of the Board until his retirement from such role, effective January 23, 2019, at which time the Board recombined the positions of Chairman and CEO, with Mr. O'Grady now serving in such combined role. Further discussion with respect to this leadership transition is set forth in the "Board Leadership Structure" section beginning on page 16. Additionally, Ms. Schreuder retired from her role as Chief Operating Officer on August 31, 2018. As discussed further under the "2018 Performance Considerations" section above, following her retirement Ms. Schreuder provided certain consulting services to the Corporation through December 31, 2018. 
(2) Amounts in this column represent the grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). See "Note 23—Share-Based Compensation Plans" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of the assumptions made by the Corporation in the valuation of these stock unit awards. This column includes the following amounts in 2018 with respect to performance stock units, which are based on achievement of target performance levels: Mr. O'Grady: $3,152,596; Mr. Waddell: $2,600,093; Mr. Bowman: $1,365,025; Mr. Fradkin: $1,495,087; Mr. Cherecwich: $1,430,056; and Ms. Schreuder: $1,950,096. If the maximum level of performance were attained, the value of the performance stock units would be as follows: Mr. O'Grady: $4,728,946; Mr. Waddell: $3,900,192; Mr. Bowman: $2,047,590; Mr. Fradkin: $2,242,684; Mr. Cherecwich: $2,145,084; and Ms. Schreuder: $2,925,144. See the narrative under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2018" beginning on page 44 of this Proxy Statement for more information on these awards.

The Corporation discontinued the use of stock options beginning with the long-term incentive awards made in February 2018. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(4) Amounts in this column represent the annual cash incentives earned by the named executive officers in the applicable years under the Management Performance Plan. 
(5) Amounts in this column represent the aggregate increase in actuarial present values of accumulated benefits under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the applicable discount rate decreased to 4.46% and 3.79%, respectively, resulting in an increase in the present value of benefits under the Traditional Formula. At December 31, 2018, the applicable discount rate increased to 4.47%, resulting in a decrease in the present value of benefits under the Traditional Formula for each named executive officer relative to December 31, 2017, except for Messrs. O'Grady and Cherecwich, whose benefits are accrued under the Pension Plan's "Pension Equity Plan (PEP) Formula." The decrease in present value of benefits for each named executive officer experiencing a decrease is as follows: Mr. Waddell: $1,711,510; Mr. Bowman: $30,226; Mr. Fradkin: $199,315; and Ms. Schreuder: $2,173,941 (of which $2,159,205 is due to payments received in 2018).

(1) These columns show information regarding payouts under the Management Performance Plan. The amount set forth under the Maximum column represents the highest potential payout under the plan based on the Corporation's 2018 performance. Although the plan does not provide for a target or threshold, the amount set forth under the Target column represents the amount actually awarded to the named executive officer in 2018 in respect of 2017 performance. 
(2) The amounts set forth under the Threshold, Target and Maximum columns represent the number of shares of common stock that would be paid out under the performance stock units granted in February 2018 if the Corporation achieves a three-year return on equity of 9.375%, 15.0% or 18.75% or greater, respectively. 
(3) This column shows the number of restricted stock units granted to the named executive officers in 2018. 
(4) Represents the grant date fair value of each equity award, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (using the target level of performance for performance stock unit awards), disregarding any estimated forfeitures. 
Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2018 
Performance Stock Units 
Each performance stock unit constitutes the right to receive a share of the Corporation's common stock and vests over a three-year performance period, subject to satisfaction of specified performance targets ("performance conditions") that are a function of return on equity, and continued employment until the end of the vesting period. Dividend equivalents granted to named executive officers in 2018 are deferred into a cash account and paid at the time the award vests only with respect to the portion of the cash account attributable to performance stock units that actually vest upon satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions. 
For awards granted to named executive officers in 2018, if during the performance period the executive's employment is terminated under certain circumstances entitling the executive to benefits under the Corporation's severance plan, such executive's performance stock units will be eligible for full vesting and distribution at the end of the performance period, subject to certain conditions, including satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions. Upon the death or disability of an executive during the performance period, or if an executive retires after satisfying applicable age and service 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
requirements, such executive's performance stock units will be eligible for full vesting and distribution at the end of the performance period, subject to certain conditions, including satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions. 
Upon a change in control of the Corporation, a pro rata portion of each performance stock unit award (based on actual performance during the portion of the performance period that has elapsed as of the change in control) will be converted into an award with respect to the acquirer of an equal economic value. The remainder of the performance award converts at the target level of performance specified in the performance stock unit agreement into an award with respect to the acquirer of an equal economic value. Both the portion of each performance stock unit award that is based on actual performance and the portion that is based on the target level of performance vest subject only to the continued employment of the recipient through the remainder of the applicable performance period, and are paid out at the end of the performance period, subject to acceleration of vesting upon a qualifying termination, in which event the units are distributed within sixty days. In the event that a change in control occurs and the acquirer refuses or is unable to agree to the foregoing conversion and vesting provisions, the award will be vested at the time of the change in control. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers in 2018 vest 25% each year for four years. Each restricted stock unit award entitles an executive to receive one share of common stock when the award vests, subject to continued employment until the end of the vesting period. Dividend equivalents on these restricted stock units are deferred into a cash account and paid at the time the awards vest only with respect to the portion of the cash account attributable to restricted stock units that actually vest. 
For awards granted to named executive officers in 2018, if during the vesting period an executive's employment is terminated under certain circumstances entitling the executive to benefits under the Corporation's severance plan, such executive's restricted stock units will continue to vest in accordance with their terms. In addition, if an executive retires after satisfying applicable age and service requirements, such executive's restricted stock units will continue to vest in accordance with their terms. Upon the death or disability of an executive during the vesting period, such executive will be entitled to the full vesting and distribution of any unvested restricted stock units. 
Upon a change in control of the Corporation, all restricted stock units granted to executive officers will, under the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements, be converted into units of the acquirer having the same value and continue to vest over a period no longer than the original vesting schedule; provided, however, that they become fully vested in connection with a change in control if the executive experiences a qualifying termination of employment following the change in control (in which case they are distributed within sixty days). In the event that a change in control occurs and the acquirer refuses or is unable to agree to the foregoing conversion and vesting provisions, the award will be vested at the time of the change in control.

(1) Amounts presented for Ms. Schreuder reflect payments made during 2018 following her retirement from the Corporation, effective August 31, 2018. The remaining balance of Ms. Schreuder's Supplemental Pension Plan account will be paid out as a five-year certain annuity, payable in annual installments through October 1, 2022. 
Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan 
Defined benefit pension benefits are provided generally to employees under the Pension Plan and to certain employees (including the named executive officers) under the Supplemental Pension Plan. The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified retirement plan that provides a retirement benefit as described below, which is subject to various limitations of the Internal Revenue Code and the Pension Plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan is a nonqualified retirement plan that provides the portion of an employee's benefit that cannot be paid under the Pension Plan due to Internal Revenue Code and Pension Plan limits. The material terms and conditions of the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan as they relate to the named executive officers include the following. 
Eligibility 
Eligible employees participate in the Pension Plan beginning the first day of the month following the completion of six months of vesting service. Employees with six months of vesting service who would have a portion of their benefit from the Pension Plan limited due to Internal Revenue Code or Pension Plan restrictions also participate in the Supplemental Pension Plan. 
Benefit Formula—Traditional Formula 
Prior to April 1, 2012, the benefits of the named executive officers, except for Messrs. O'Grady and Cherecwich, were determined under the Pension Plan's "Traditional Formula." To determine a participant's benefit, the Traditional Formula first multiplies 1.8% by the average of the participant's highest sixty consecutive calendar months of eligible pay. This amount is further multiplied by the participant's years of credited service (up to a maximum of thirty-five years). The Social Security offset is then determined by multiplying 0.5% by (i) the lesser of the participant's Social Security covered compensation limit or the average of the participant's eligible pay for the three consecutive calendar years prior to retirement, with calendar year compensation not to exceed the Social Security taxable wage base in effect for a given calendar year, by (ii) the participant's years of credited service (up to thirty-five years). This offset is subtracted from the benefit amount previously calculated to determine the annual benefit amount produced by the Traditional Formula. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
For purposes of the Traditional Formula: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Eligible pay means base salary (including any before-tax payroll  deductions), shift differentials, overtime and certain types of performance-based incentive compensation, including cash, Northern Performance Incentives under the Northern Partners Incentive Plan (NPIP), compensation under the  Management Performance Plan, payments from the former Annual Performance Plan and the cash value of stock options which were specifically paid in lieu of cash incentives from January 1, 2002 through April 30, 2004. Cash incentives deferred  under the Northern Trust Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Compensation Plan) are not included in eligible pay under the Pension Plan but are included in eligible pay under the Supplemental Pension Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Social Security covered compensation means the average of the Social Security taxable wage base for each of  the thirty-five calendar years ending in the year in which the participant attains Social Security retirement age. In determining Social Security covered compensation as of a certain year, the taxable wage base for any subsequent year is assumed to  be the same as for the determination year.  
[END TABLE]
Benefit Formula—PEP Formula 
Effective June 1, 2001, the Pension Plan was amended to provide that benefits of all newly hired employees of the Corporation and its affiliates would be calculated under the Pension Plan's "Pension Equity Plan (PEP) Formula." Because Mr. O'Grady commenced employment on August 15, 2011, and Mr. Cherecwich commenced employment on July 9, 2007, their respective benefits under the Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan are calculated entirely under the PEP Formula. Under the PEP Formula, each year a participant earns a specific pension credit "percentage," determined in accordance with a schedule in the Pension Plan that varies directly with his or her total number of years of credited service. Participants currently earn a 4% pension credit percentage for each of their first ten credited years of service, with the pension credit percentage increasing by one percentage point for the eleventh year of service and every fifth year thereafter through the end of their thirty-fifth year of service (after which no additional pension credit percentages are earned). A participant's PEP Formula lump sum amount is equal to the sum of his or her pension credit percentages multiplied by the average of the participant's highest sixty consecutive calendar months of eligible pay. Prior to April 1, 2012, eligible pay was defined the same for the PEP Formula as for the Traditional Formula, except that eligible pay under the PEP Formula also included cash sales and technical incentives under the NPIP up to 50% of the participant's prior year's base pay. Effective April 1, 2012, eligible pay under the PEP Formula includes all cash incentives under the NPIP. A participant's annual benefit under the PEP Formula is equal to a single life annuity commencing at age 65 that is the actuarial equivalent of his or her PEP Formula lump sum amount. The single life annuity is calculated using interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in the Pension Plan. 
Benefit Formula—Changes 
As noted above, effective June 1, 2001, the Pension Plan was amended to provide that benefits of all newly hired employees of the Corporation and its affiliates would be calculated under a version of the PEP Formula. All employees already employed by the Corporation and its affiliates prior to such time were provided the opportunity to elect whether to accrue future benefits under such PEP Formula or the Traditional Formula. Effective April 1, 2012, the Pension Plan was further amended to provide that for credited service earned after March 31, 2012, all employees, including those who had previously elected the Traditional Formula, will accrue benefits pursuant to the revised PEP Formula described above. Accordingly, the named executive officers, other than Messrs. O'Grady and Cherecwich, will be (or in the case of Mr. Waddell and Ms. Schreuder upon their respective retirements from the Corporation, became) entitled to an annual benefit equal to the sum of their accruals: (i) under the Traditional Formula for periods of credited service before April 1, 2012; and (ii) under the amended PEP Formula for their periods of credited service after March 31, 2012. Each such executive's pre-April 1, 2012 Traditional Formula benefits will be (or was, as the case may be) based on credited service and average compensation calculated as of March 31, 2012, provided that the executive's average compensation as of March 31, 2012, will be indexed at a rate of 1.5% per year for any period on and after April 1, 2012, during which the executive earns credited service under the Pension Plan. 
Although the April 1, 2012 changes made to the Pension Plan are anticipated to moderate any future pension value increases, the present value of benefits under the Traditional Formula is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The increase in discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension benefits from 3.79% at December 31, 2017 to 4.47% at December 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in the present value of benefits under the Traditional Formula for each of the named executive officers, except for Messrs. O'Grady and Cherecwich, whose benefits are all accrued under the PEP Formula. The other primary factors influencing pension values include an increase in the highest average pay calculation and the application of the highest average pay across years of credited service under the Pension Plan. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Benefit Formula—Supplemental Pension Plan 
Pension benefits are first calculated under the combined Traditional Formula and PEP Formulas or solely under the PEP Formula, as applicable, without regard to Internal Revenue Code limits and including in eligible pay the amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. They are then recalculated applying Internal Revenue Code limits and excluding Deferred Compensation Plan deferrals from eligible pay to determine the amount of the benefit that is payable from the Pension Plan. The difference between the total benefit calculation and the Pension Plan calculation is paid from the Supplemental Pension Plan. 
Benefit Entitlement 
A participant is eligible to receive a benefit under the Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan after completing three years of vesting service. 
Retirement 
A participant is generally eligible for a normal retirement benefit based on the combined Traditional and PEP Formulas or based solely on the PEP Formula, as described above, if his or her employment terminates on or after age 65 and he or she has completed at least five years of vesting service. Mr. Waddell was eligible for normal retirement benefits at the time of his retirement. A participant is eligible for an early retirement benefit if his or her employment terminates on or after age 55 and he or she has completed fifteen years of credited service. Mr. Bowman and Mr. Fradkin are eligible for early retirement benefits, as was Ms. Schreuder at the time of her retirement. A participant who terminates employment with three years of vesting service but prior to becoming eligible for a normal or early retirement benefit is eligible for a "vested terminee" benefit commencing any time after termination. 
Under the Traditional Formula, the early retirement benefit is equal to the normal retirement benefit described above, reduced by 0.5% for each month payments are received prior to age 62 (or prior to age 60 under certain circumstances). Participants eligible for a "vested terminee" benefit are entitled to benefit payments that are reduced by 0.5% for each month up to 120 months that payments are received prior to age 65, then actuarially reduced for each month that payments are received prior to age 55. 
Under the PEP Formula, both the early retirement benefit and "vested terminee" benefit are equal to the normal retirement benefit (in the form of a monthly single life annuity as described above), adjusted for early commencement prior to age 65. The adjustment is made using interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in the Pension Plan. 
Form of Benefit Payment 
The normal form of benefit payment under the Pension Plan is a single life annuity in the case of an unmarried participant and a 50% joint and survivor annuity in the case of a married participant, although optional forms of payment are available, depending on marital status and age and years of service. A lump sum option is available in all cases. All optional forms are the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of payment. The normal form of benefit under the Supplemental Pension Plan is a five-year certain annuity, payable to the participant in five annual installments; if the participant dies prior to receiving full benefits, payments will continue for the remainder of the five years to a designated beneficiary. Any installment payments are credited with interest pursuant to a market-based formula set forth in the Supplemental Pension Plan. If the value of the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit is $125,000 or less, the benefit is paid in a single lump sum. 
Assumptions 
The assumptions used in calculating the present value of the accumulated benefit are set forth in "Note 22—Employee Benefits" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Corporation does not grant extra years of credited service under the Pension Plan, other than as noted below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or a Change in Control of the Corporation."

(3)  The aggregate earnings in this column are not "above-market" and therefore are not included in the "Summary Compensation Table." 
(4)  All amounts in this column have previously been included in each named executive officer's compensation reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" to the extent that compensation data for each such officer, generally, has been included in such table. 
(5)  Amounts presented for Ms. Schreuder reflect payments made during 2018 following her retirement from the Corporation, effective August 31, 2018. The remaining balances presented at December 31, 2018 were subsequently distributed to Ms. Schreuder on March 1, 2019 following the six-month delay of the payment of such amounts in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Corporation provides certain highly compensated employees, including the named executive officers, the opportunity to defer up to 100% of their short-term incentive awards that would otherwise be payable in a specified calendar year into the Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred amounts represent general unsecured obligations of the Corporation. The Corporation has established a grantor trust (referred to as a "rabbi" trust), under which the assets of the Deferred Compensation Plan are held and invested, to assist the Corporation in satisfying its obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan when a distribution event occurs. The Corporation does not provide any matching contributions or guaranteed rates of return with respect to deferred amounts. Earnings credited with respect to amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are based on the performance of a variety of investment alternatives made available under the plan and selected by the participant. Participants are fully vested in the amounts they defer at all times. 
Each participant in the Deferred Compensation Plan makes an annual irrevocable election prior to the beginning of each performance year. Awards are generally deferred until retirement, with the option to elect a short-term deferral of at least three years. At the time the participant makes a deferral election, he or she must also elect whether retirement deferrals 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
will be distributed in a lump sum or in five- or ten-year installments. If the participant's employment ends for any reason other than retirement before the short-term deferral distribution date, the participant's account balance will be distributed in a lump sum. If the participant is deemed to be a "key employee," as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, any short-term incentive award that was deferred after December 31, 2004 and is payable due to separation from service will be delayed for six months following the date of the separation. 
Supplemental TIP 
Supplemental TIP is a nonqualified retirement plan that provides the portion of an employee's benefit that cannot be paid under TIP due to the Internal Revenue Code's limit on the amount of a participant's compensation that can be taken into account in determining TIP benefits. Account information provided for Supplemental TIP also includes account balances in the Northern Trust Corporation Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which was frozen effective January 1, 2005, when the qualified Northern Trust Employee Stock Ownership Plan was merged into TIP. The material terms and conditions of Supplemental TIP as they relate to the named executive officers include the following. 
Eligibility 
An employee is eligible to participate in Supplemental TIP for any calendar year if he or she participates in TIP and as of the prior November 30 his or her base salary exceeded the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit. Employees are eligible to participate in TIP and elect salary deferrals immediately upon their hire, and are eligible for employer matching contributions beginning the first day of the month following the completion of six months of vesting service. All named executive officers participated in both plans in 2018. 
Contributions 
Each participant must make an election prior to the beginning of a calendar year to contribute to Supplemental TIP a portion of his or her base salary that exceeds the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit. The Corporation makes a matching contribution under Supplemental TIP using the formula in TIP, which is 50% of the first 6% of deferred salary, for a maximum matching contribution of 3% of salary. 
Vesting 
Each participant generally vests in the employer contributions under TIP and Supplemental TIP on a graduated basis of 20% per year over five years and is fully vested after completing five years of service. The named executive officers are fully vested in their TIP and Supplemental TIP accounts. 
Investments 
Each participant's Supplemental TIP account is credited with earnings or losses based on various mutual fund investment alternatives made available under Supplemental TIP and selected by the participant (which are generally similar to the investment alternatives available to participants under TIP). On a daily basis, participants can change their Supplemental TIP investment alternatives among the alternatives offered in Supplemental TIP. 
Distributions 
No withdrawal or borrowing of Supplemental TIP assets is permitted during a participant's employment. Distribution of the entire Supplemental TIP account balance generally is made to a participant within ninety days after the participant's termination of employment. If the participant is deemed to be a "key employee," as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, the portion of his or her Supplemental TIP account accruing after December 31, 2004 is distributed as a single lump sum following the six-month anniversary of the termination of employment. 
Deferred Stock Units 
Certain restricted stock units granted prior to 2010 were required to be deferred until the earlier of: (i) the year in which the Compensation and Benefits Committee reasonably anticipates that, if the payment is made during that year, the deduction of the payment will not be barred by Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m); or (ii) the period beginning with the date of the participant's separation from service (as defined in the Corporation's Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan) and ending on the later of the last day of the Corporation's taxable year in which the participant incurs a separation from service or the fifteenth day of the third month following such separation from service. "Aggregate Earnings in Last FY" in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table above represent the change in the value of deferred stock units, which is based 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
on the change in the value of the underlying shares of common stock into which the stock units convert. As noted in the notes to such table, the deferred stock units held by Ms. Schreuder were distributed to her on March 1, 2019, in connection with her retirement from the Corporation in August 2018. Deferred stock units held by Mr. Waddell are expected to be distributed to him on August  1, 2019, in connection with his retirement from the Corporation in January 2019. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or a Change in Control of the Corporation 
In addition to benefits to which the Corporation's employees would be entitled upon a termination of employment generally, the Corporation provides certain additional benefits to eligible employees upon certain types of termination of employment, including a termination of employment involving a change in control of the Corporation. Described below are the benefits that the named executive officers would receive upon certain types of termination of employment, upon a change in control of the Corporation and upon a termination following a change in control of the Corporation. 
Equity Compensation Plans and Agreements 
As described above under "Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2018" beginning on page 44, the Corporation's equity compensation plans and agreements provide enhanced benefits to named executive officers upon a termination of employment with the Corporation or a subsidiary due to death, disability, or retirement (when such termination is not a termination described in his or her employment security agreement as discussed below). 
In the case of a termination of a named executive officer's employment due to death, disability or severance, stock options previously granted under equity compensation plans will accelerate. In the case of a termination of a named executive officer's employment due to retirement (after satisfying applicable age and service requirements), stock options previously granted under equity compensation plans will continue vesting. In the case of a termination of a named executive officer's employment due to death or disability, equity award agreements for restricted stock units and performance stock units granted prior to February 17, 2015 provide for prorated vesting of units, while agreements for awards granted on or after February 17, 2015, provide for the full vesting of such units. In the case of a termination of a named executive officer's employment due to severance, equity award agreements for restricted stock units and performance stock units granted prior to February 20, 2018 provide for prorated vesting of units, while agreements for awards granted on or after February 20, 2018 provide for continued vesting. In the case of a termination of a named executive officer's employment due to retirement (after satisfying applicable age and service requirements), equity award agreements for restricted stock units and performance stock units granted prior to February 21, 2017 provide for prorated vesting of units, while agreements for awards granted on or after February 21, 2017 provide for continued vesting. 
Employment Security Agreements 
As discussed above under "Severance Benefits and Employment Security Arrangements" beginning on page 38, the Corporation has employment security agreements with each of its currently employed named executive officers and certain other executive officers. The Corporation's decision to enter into these employment security agreements and the determination of the level of benefits under these agreements, as well as under various termination of employment scenarios were exercises in judgment, informed by: (i) the recognition that all named executive officers are employed at-will; (ii) the Corporation's desire to provide the named executive officers with sufficient security to ensure they are not distracted and remain focused on maximizing stockholder value during and after a change in control; (iii) the Corporation's goal of providing executive compensation at levels that are competitive with similar positions to those in its peer group companies; (iv) the nature and scope of the job responsibilities undertaken by the named executive officers; and (v) the terms of other types of compensation paid by the Corporation to the named executive officers. In particular, in setting the terms of the benefits payable to the named executive officers under various termination scenarios, the Compensation and Benefits Committee was guided in large part by a desire to be sufficiently responsive to market forces and the environment in which the Corporation seeks to attract, motivate and retain its named executive officers by providing benefits consistent and competitive with those of the peer group companies with which it competes for top executive talent. In initially establishing the form and level of post-termination benefits, the Committee received and reviewed relevant peer group company information provided by its independent compensation consultant at the time. In particular, this competitive peer group data influenced the decision of the Committee to provide for employment security agreements, to set the level of lump sum payments equal to three years of salary and bonus and to provide for the vesting of equity compensation awards, the continuation of coverage under certain health and welfare plans and other protections afforded in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Under the employment security agreements currently in place, the benefits provided to a named executive officer upon the occurrence of an actual change in control of the Corporation would consist of the following, even if there is no termination of employment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Full vesting of all stock options.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● All outstanding nonqualified stock options remain exercisable for five years following termination of employment (or  until the end of the option term, if earlier).

● Full vesting of all outstanding restricted stock units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Full vesting and immediate distribution of all outstanding performance stock units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Full vesting in benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan and Supplemental TIP. All named executive officers  are already vested in these benefits.  
[END TABLE]
The employment security agreements also provide benefits upon the occurrence of the following terminations of employment that are in connection with an actual or pending change in control of the Corporation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a termination of the executives employment by the Corporation or a subsidiary without good cause that  occurs either within two years after a change in control of the Corporation or during the one-year period pending a change in control of the Corporation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● an executives voluntary termination of employment with the Corporation or a subsidiary for good  reason that occurs either within two years after a change in control of the Corporation or during the one-year period pending a change in control of the Corporation.  
[END TABLE]
The benefits provided to a named executive officer upon such a termination of employment would consist of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A lump sum payment equal to three times the sum of: (i) the named executive officers annual salary in effect  on the date of employment termination, or if higher, the date of the change in control; and (ii) the average of the named executive officers awards under the Corporations cash incentive plans for the last three fiscal years of  participation in such plans prior to the date of termination, or, if higher, the date of the change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A lump sum payment of a prorated portion of the average amounts paid to the named executive officer under the  Corporations cash incentive plans for the last three fiscal years of participation in such plans prior to the date of termination, or, if higher, the date of the change in control, less any amounts paid to the named executive officer under  those plans with respect to completed performance periods occurring in the year the named executive officers employment terminates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Continued coverage under the Corporations health, dental, life, accident, disability, and other welfare benefit  plans for three years or, if earlier, until the executive becomes covered under similar plans maintained by another entity that provides at least equal benefits. If the named executive officer cannot be covered under any plan of the Corporation due  to legal or contractual restrictions, the Corporation would provide the executive with substantially similar benefits and coverage.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Up to an additional three years of age and/or service credits for purposes of determining eligibility and subsidy for  participation in the Corporations retiree medical plans and an additional three-year age and service credit for benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Fradkin would be entitled to an additional cash payment equal to an amount that would offset any excise tax  liability arising under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of any payment or benefit arising under an employment security agreement. Since 2011, the Corporation has discontinued inclusion of tax  gross-up payments in new employment security agreements for executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
The foregoing notwithstanding, payments to Messrs. O'Grady, Bowman and Cherecwich may be subject to a reduction in benefits received to the extent it would cause them to receive an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) unless the change in control payments, less the amount of any excise taxes payable by them, is greater than the reduced payment. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Change in Control Plan 
In 2017, we issued to each of the executive officers party to an employment security agreement, including each of the named executive officers, a termination notice with respect to the agreement. Under the terms of the employment security agreements, such a notice must be provided at least two years in advance of the effective date of such termination. Following the effective date of the termination of the employment security agreements on June 1, 2019, each named executive officer remaining employed by the Corporation at that time will become a participant in the Change in Control Plan, providing participants with certain benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment within two years following a change in control. The Change in Control Plan will align better the change in control severance benefits provided to our named executive officers with market practice and will eliminate the use of individual employment security agreements. Significant changes to the change in control severance benefits provided to our named executive officers upon the termination of their employment security agreements and participation in the Change in Control Plan include: (i) the reduction of the lump sum severance multiple from three times to two times for all participants in the Change in Control Plan except the CEO; (ii) the elimination of extra age and service credits for the pension plan; (iii) the elimination of all excise tax gross-ups (including those previously grandfathered); and (iv) the elimination of the single-trigger vesting of any equity award upon a change in control, such that all equity awards will be subject to double-trigger vesting in connection with an actual change in control in accordance with the provisions set forth in the terms and conditions of such awards. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Except as otherwise noted, the following table quantifies the additional amounts described above that each named executive officer would receive upon the related triggering event assuming such event took place on December 31, 2018. As our named executive officers will not participate in the Change in Control Plan until the effective date of the termination of their employment security agreements on June 1, 2019, amounts provided below do not reflect participation in such plan.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Note: The value of each equity award included in this table is based on a price of $83.59 per share (the closing market price of the Corporation's common stock on December 31, 2018). 
(1) Upon retirement, death or disability each named executive officer remains eligible to receive a termination year bonus under the Management Performance Plan at the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits Committee. 
(2) Performance stock unit award values are based upon the target number of shares underlying 2016, 2017 and 2018 awards outstanding as of December 31, 2018. 
(3) The amount presented is an estimate of the difference between the amount the individual would receive at termination in connection with a change in control and the amount the individual would have received if the termination were not in connection with a change in control. The assumptions used in calculating the present value of this benefit enhancement associated with the additional age and service credits are the September 2018 Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) lump sum segment rates and the 2019 Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) lump sum mortality table. 
(4) The value of this continued benefit coverage for three years is derived by multiplying the Corporation's annual cost of providing such coverage in 2018 by three. 
(5) Amounts presented for Mr. Waddell and Ms. Schreuder reflect the value of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units which vested upon their retirement from employment with the Corporation in January 2019 and August 2018, respectively. 
(6) Messrs. Bowman and Cherecwich are entitled to a twelve-month enhancement to the pro-rata severance calculations for outstanding restricted stock units granted in 2015. Mr. Cherecwich is also entitled to a twelve-month enhancement to the pro-rata severance calculations for restricted stock units and performance stock units granted in 2016 and all named executive officers are entitled to a twelve-month enhancement to pro-rata severance calculations for restricted stock units and performance stock units granted in 2017. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
The table below sets forth an estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than the CEO, for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Our median employee was identified originally as of October 1, 2017, using the total cash compensation paid to all full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees in all jurisdictions for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, with the exception of approximately 230 employees who joined Northern Trust in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration business in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on September 30, 2017. 
In determining whether it would be appropriate to use the previously identified median employee when presenting the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the median of all of our employees for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "2018 CEO pay ratio disclosure"), we considered whether the inclusion of the previously excluded employees noted above, or any other changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements, would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure and concluded that they would not. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the previously identified median employee departed Northern Trust in 2018, an employee with substantially similar compensation based on the compensation methodology used to identify the 2017 median employee was selected for our 2018 CEO pay ratio disclosure. The annual total compensation of such employee reflected above was calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the compensation of our named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee is responsible for reviewing non-employee director compensation and making a recommendation with respect thereto to the Board. In doing so, the Committee works with its independent compensation consultant to periodically review non-employee director compensation data for the same peer group utilized by the Committee to inform its decision-making with respect to executive compensation and has access to such other resources as it deems appropriate. Under the current plan design, non-employee directors are compensated for their services with cash compensation and equity awards in the form of restricted stock units. Directors who are employees of the Corporation receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board or on any Board committee. 
Annual Retainer and Other Fees 
Non-employee directors of the Corporation received an annual retainer of $220,000 for their service on the Board in 2018, paid 50% in cash and 50% in the form of restricted stock units. In addition to the annual retainer, directors serving as the Chair of any Board committee were entitled to an additional $15,000 annually and the Corporation's Lead Director was entitled to an additional $25,000 annually. Directors serving on the Audit, Business Risk and Capital Governance Committees (including the Chairs thereof) were entitled to an additional $10,000 annually. All fees that are in addition to the annual retainer noted above are paid in cash. 
Restricted stock units granted to directors for their service on the Board were made in April 2018 and will vest on April 23, 2019, the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Stock units do not have voting rights. Dividend equivalents on the non-employee directors' stock units are subject to the same vesting, forfeiture and distribution provisions as the underlying stock units. Each stock unit entitles a director to one share of common stock at vesting, unless a director elects to defer receipt of the shares. 
Deferral of Compensation 
Non-employee directors may elect to defer payment of their cash compensation and stock units until termination of their service as directors. Any deferred cash compensation is converted into stock units representing shares of common stock. The value of each such stock unit is based upon the price of the stock at the end of the calendar quarter for which the cash compensation would have been paid. Dividends on all stock units deferred prior to January 1, 2018 (including stock units representing deferred cash compensation) are paid quarterly to a cash account and accrue interest at an interest rate determined from time to time by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Dividends on all stock units deferred on or after January 1, 2018 (including stock units representing deferred cash compensation) are converted into additional stock units representing shares of common stock based upon the closing price of the stock on the day such dividend would have been paid. For compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2018, the value of stock units representing deferred cash compensation, as well as all dividends on stock units representing deferred compensation of any form, will be paid out in cash, and stock units representing deferred stock unit compensation will be distributed in stock, in each case in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments at the election of the director. For compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2018, the value of all stock units (including stock units representing deferred cash compensation, as well as all dividends on stock units representing deferred compensation of any form) will be distributed in stock in a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments at the election of the director. 
Other Director Compensation 
Directors are eligible to participate in the Corporation's matching gift program, under which the Corporation matches gifts made by employees and directors to eligible nonprofit organizations, on the same terms as employees. The maximum gift total for a non-employee director participant in the program is $2,000 in any calendar year. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
By the fifth anniversary of election to the Board, non-employee directors are required to hold shares of the Corporation's common stock equal to five times the annual cash retainer provided to directors. If the minimum ownership level requirement is not met upon or at any time after such date, he or she is expected to retain 100% of the net, after-tax shares received upon vesting of equity awards or exercises of stock options until the minimum is met. 
As of December 31, 2018, all non-employee directors met or exceeded the stock ownership guidelines to which they were subject.

Director Compensation Table 
The following table sets forth all compensation earned by each non-employee director of the Corporation in 2018. Ms. Klevorn and Mr. Mehta were each appointed to the Board effective January 22, 2019, and therefore did not earn any compensation in 2018 relating to their Board service.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee is responsible for providing oversight of the Corporation's financial reporting functions and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's function is one of oversight, recognizing that: (i) management is responsible for the complete and accurate preparation of the Corporation's financial statements, including internal control over financial reporting; and (ii) KPMG LLP, the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an audit on such financial statements and expressing an opinion as to whether they are free of material misstatement and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. KPMG LLP is also responsible for expressing an opinion as to whether the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 
Consistent with its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG LLP the Corporation's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the firm's assessment of the Corporation's internal controls and the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standards No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." The Audit Committee has also received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence" and has conducted a discussion with KMPG LLP regarding its independence. The Audit Committee also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by KPMG LLP to the Corporation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 is compatible with maintaining KPMG LLP's independence. 
Based on the above-mentioned reviews and discussions, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Corporation's audited consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

[END TABLE]
Audit Fees include fees for professional services rendered for the annual integrated audit of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year (including services relating to the audit of internal control over financial reporting) audits of subsidiary financial statements and reviews of the financial statements included in the Corporation's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
Audit-Related Fees include fees for services that were reasonably related to performance of the audit of the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, other than Audit Fees, such as comfort letters, employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, and other attestation services. 
Tax Fees include fees for tax return preparation, tax compliance and tax advice. 
All Other Fees include fees for all services other than Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, and Tax Fees, including various advisory and assurance services. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has in place a policy regarding the engagement of independent public accounting firms to provide auditor services to the Corporation. The purpose of the policy is to establish procedures for Audit Committee pre-approval of all auditor services to be provided to the Corporation by its independent registered public accounting firm. Auditor services include audit services, audit-related services, and non-audit services, including tax services. The policy provides that the Audit Committee, the Chairman, or any Audit Committee member delegated the authority (a "Designated Member") has the authority to grant pre-approvals of auditor services. In addition, the policy provides that the independent registered public accounting firm may be engaged to provide only those non-audit services: (i) that are permitted by SEC rules; and (ii) that, in the judgment of the Audit Committee, maintain the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Corporation. In evaluating whether a proposed engagement of the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for a specific permitted non-audit service maintains the firm's independence from the Corporation, the Audit Committee or a Designated Member thereof must consider whether the proposed engagement would cause the independent registered public accounting firm to: (a) audit its own work; (b) perform management functions; or (c) act as an advocate for the Corporation. The independent registered public accounting firm shall in no event be engaged to perform any prohibited services, as set forth in the policy. 
All audit, audit-related, tax and other services provided by KPMG LLP in 2018 were pre-approved in accordance with the Audit Committee's policy regarding the engagement of independent public accounting firms to provide auditor services to the Corporation. 
ITEM 3—RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The independent registered public accounting firm is appointed annually by the Corporation's Audit Committee. For the year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee has authorized the engagement of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm. KPMG LLP served as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they wish and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm is not required. However, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders for ratification because it believes it is a governance best practice to do so. If the stockholders fail to ratify KPMG LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee will reassess its appointment, but in such event it may elect to retain KPMG LLP nonetheless. Further, even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of KPMG LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
ITEM 4—STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING 
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
Information regarding a stockholder proposal is set forth below. The Corporation disclaims any responsibility for the content of this proposal and statement of support, which is presented as received from the stockholder. The Unitarian Universalist Association, 24 Farnsworth Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, the owner of 1,002 shares of our common stock, has given the Corporation notice that its representative intends to present this proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Stockholder Proposal 
Resolved, that the shareholders of Northern Trust Corporation ("Northern Trust" or "Company") hereby request that the Company provide a report, updated semiannually, disclosing the Company's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or  indirect) to (a) participate or intervene in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and  indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a.  The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b.  The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making.  
[END TABLE]
The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending. 
Stockholder Supporting Statement 
As long-term shareholders of Northern Trust, we support transparency and accountability in corporate political spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates. 
Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, "[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages." 
Publicly available records show Northern Trust has contributed at least $70,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com; National Institute on Money in State Politics, www.followthemoney.org). 
However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's political spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its political spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including State Street Corporation, U.S. Bancorp, and Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, which present this information on their websites. 
The Company's board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets. We urge your support for this critical governance reform. 
Statement of the Board of Directors in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal 
The Board of Directors believes that the proponent's proposal is not in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders and unanimously recommends a vote against the proposal. 
The Corporation makes no direct political contributions. The Corporation's public advocacy activities primarily consist of its sponsorship of two political action committees ("PACs") that accept voluntary contributions from its employees and membership in a limited number of trade associations supporting public policy positions aligned with the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. 
The two PACs sponsored by the Corporation fully comply with all disclosure requirements pertaining to political contributions under applicable law, including federal laws requiring that they report all contributions made by them to the U.S. Federal Election Commission. These reports are publicly available on the U.S. Federal Election Commission's website and a direct link to such website is included in the Corporation's "Statement Regarding Government Relations and Political Contributions" publicly available on the Corporation's website. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, cumulative political contributions made by these PACs totaled $47,300, $66,900, and $50,500, respectively. 
The Corporation does not control how the limited number of trade associations of which it is a member make use of its dues and expects that such associations comply with all requirements pertaining to their political activities under applicable law. Information with respect to the principal trade associations of which the Corporation is a member is provided in the Corporation's "Statement Regarding Government Relations and Political Contributions," publicly available on the Corporation's website. 
The Corporation has implemented an appropriate governance structure with respect to its public advocacy activities. This governance includes oversight by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, which, in accordance with its written charter, receives periodic reports from management on the political, lobbying, and other public advocacy activities of the Corporation. 
In light of the foregoing, the Board believes that the additional reporting sought in the proponent's proposal would be an unnecessary and imprudent use of the Corporation's time and resources and would not provide any appreciable benefit to its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
ITEM 5—STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING THE RIGHT OF NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION'S STOCKHOLDERS TO CALL A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE STOCKHOLDERS 
Information regarding a stockholder proposal is set forth below. The Corporation disclaims any responsibility for the content of this proposal and statement of support, which is presented as received from the stockholders. James McRitchie and Myra K. Young, 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, California 95758, the owners of 45 shares of our common stock, have given the Corporation notice that their representative intends to present this proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Stockholder Proposal 
ITEM 5 – Provide Right to Call Special Shareholder Meetings 
RESOLVED: The shareholders of Northern Trust Corp ('Company') hereby request the Board of Directors take the steps necessary to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders with an aggregate of 15% net long of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting. 
Stockholder Supporting Statement 
Delaware law allows 10% of company shares to call a special meeting. A shareholder right to call a special meeting is a way to bring an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. This is important because there could be 15-months between annual meetings. 
Currently, 64% of S&P 500 companies have adopted company bylaws, articles of incorporation, or charter provisions to allow shareholders to call a special meeting. Even 56% of all S&P 1500 companies allow shareholders this right. 
In 2018, the topic of providing shareholders a right to call a special meeting or to reduce the threshold to call such meetings won 50%+ at Neflix [sic], Lincoln National, Omnicom Group, Cummins, and Sprint [sic] Aerosystems Holdings, as well as 94% at Nuance Communications. 
Large funds such as Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, BlackRock and SSgA Funds Management, Inc. (State Street) <https://www.proxyinsight.com/members/FMProfile.aspx?cmpid=216> support the right of shareholders to call special meetings. 
It may be possible to adopt this proposal by simply incorporating this text into our governing documents: 
"Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or President or Secretary upon the order in writing of a majority of or by resolution of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning 15% net long of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote." 
Please vote for: Provide Right to Call Special Shareholder Meetings – Proposal 5 
Statement of the Board of Directors in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal 
The Board of Directors believes that the proponent's proposal is not in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders and unanimously recommends a vote against the proposal. 
The Board regularly reviews the Corporation's governance practices and believes that the Corporation has solid and efficient mechanisms in place to allow stockholders to communicate with the Board and bring items to its attention. These mechanisms include the meaningful right for stockholders holding a net long position in 25% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock to request a special meeting. For this reason and the other reasons outlined below, the Board believes that the proponent's proposal is not in the best interests of the Corporation or its stockholders. 
The Corporation's stockholders already have a meaningful right to call special meetings. 
The Corporation's By-laws currently provide stockholders holding a net long position in 25% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock with the right to request a special meeting, subject to qualifications designed to prevent duplicative and unnecessary meetings. The Board adopted this right on February 19, 2019, after careful consideration and with the benefit of input from several of the Corporation's largest stockholders, and it continues to believe that the 25% threshold provided for in the By-laws is most appropriate for the Corporation. 
Special meetings require substantial resources, and the provisions of the Corporation's By-laws granting stockholders the right to call such meetings strike the right balance between providing stockholders a forum to address important matters and the conservation of corporate resources.
The Board recognizes the importance of providing stockholders with the right to call special meetings in appropriate circumstances. However, convening a special meeting of stockholders is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial commitment of time and financial resources on the part of the Corporation. Special meetings also require the Board and senior management to divert time from the Corporation's business to prepare for and conduct the meetings. Accordingly, special meetings of stockholders should be extraordinary events that occur only when there are urgent and important strategic matters or profound fiduciary concerns. 
The current provisions of the Corporation's By-laws providing stockholders holding a net long position in 25% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock with the right to call special meetings strike the appropriate balance, as such provisions allow for stockholders to call a special meeting when extraordinary matters arise without enabling a small minority of stockholders to call unnecessary or duplicative meetings for less significant matters. If the 15% net long ownership threshold suggested by the proponent's proposal were adopted, a small minority of stockholders—potentially with narrow, short-term interests—could call special meetings any time to present proposals with little likelihood of success, without regard to how the costs and other burdens might impact the Corporation's future success or the interests of the vast majority of stockholders. 
The Corporation is committed to stockholder engagement and sound governance practices. 
Members of senior management meet regularly with stockholders to discuss the Corporation's performance, strategies and governance, as discussed under "Stockholder Engagement" beginning on page 19 of this Proxy Statement. The Board strongly believes that this commitment to ongoing dialogue with stockholders and the Corporation's strong corporate governance practices—such as the declassified structure of the Board, the proxy access right provided to eligible stockholders, the lack of supermajority voting requirements or a "poison pill," and stockholders' existing rights to call special meetings and act by written consent—protect stockholder rights without the expense and risk associated with the terms of the proponent's proposal. 
For these reasons, the proponent's proposal regarding the right of the Corporation's stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders is neither necessary nor in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
Any stockholder proposals for the Corporation's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (other than proxy access nominations) must be received by the Corporation, directed to the attention of the Corporation's Corporate Secretary, no later than November 13, 2019 in order to be eligible for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. Director nominations for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the proxy access provision in the Corporation's By-laws must be received by the Corporation's Corporate Secretary no earlier than October 14, 2019 and no later than November 13, 2019. All proposals and director nominations submitted by stockholders must comply in all respects with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Corporation's By-laws. 
Under the Corporation's By-laws other proposals that are not eligible for inclusion in the proxy statement will be considered timely and may be eligible for presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders if they are received by the Corporation in the form of a written notice, directed to the attention of the Corporation's Corporate Secretary, no earlier than November 25, 2019 and no later than December 26, 2019. If the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is called for a date that is not within thirty days before or after the anniversary date of this Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be received within ten days after notice of the 2020 Annual Meeting is mailed or public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting is made, whichever occurs first. The notice must contain the information required by the Corporation's By-laws.
