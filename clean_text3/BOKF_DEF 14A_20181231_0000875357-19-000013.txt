PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
To be held April 30, 2019 
General
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of BOK Financial Corporation for use at our annual meeting of shareholders.  The annual meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at 2:30 p.m. local time via live webcast at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/BOKF2019.  
These proxy materials will be mailed on or about March 15, 2019 to holders of record of common stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2019.
Voting by Proxy
If you are the "record holder" of your shares (shares owned in your own name and not through a bank or brokerage firm), you may vote by phone, by mail, over the Internet, or in person (via live webcast) at the annual meeting. We encourage you to vote by phone, mail, or on the Internet in advance of the meeting even if you plan to attend the live webcast of the meeting.    
If not revoked, your proxy will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with your instructions marked on the proxy card. If you fail to mark your proxy with instructions, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors: (1) FOR the election of the twenty three (23) nominees for director listed in this Proxy Statement, (2) FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and (3) FOR the approval of the named executives' compensation. If you are voting shares held in the BOK Financial Thrift Plan and you fail to mark your proxy with instructions, your shares will be voted by the Trustee of the Thrift Plan in the same ratio as those shares credited to the account of the Thrift Plan members who do give instructions to the Trustee.
If you hold your shares in "street name" (shares held in the name of a bank or broker on a person's behalf), you must vote by following the instructions on the form that you receive from your broker or nominee. Without your instructions, your broker or nominee is permitted to use its own discretion and vote your shares on certain routine matters (such as Item 2), but is not permitted to use discretion and vote your shares on non-routine matters (such as Items 1 and 3). We urge you to give voting instructions to your broker on all voting items. 
As to any other matter that may properly be brought before the annual meeting, your proxy will be voted as the Board of Directors may recommend. If the Board of Directors makes no recommendation, your proxy will be voted as the proxy holder named in your proxy card deems advisable. The Board of Directors does not know of any other matter that is expected to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting.
Any shareholder executing a proxy retains the right to revoke it any time prior to exercise at the annual meeting.  A proxy may be revoked by (i) delivery of written notice of revocation to Frederic Dorwart, Secretary, at 124 East Fourth Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103, (ii) execution and delivery of a later proxy to the address indicated on the proxy card, or (iii) voting the shares electronically at the annual meeting. If not revoked, all shares represented by properly executed proxies will be voted as specified therein.
Voting and Quorum Requirements at the Meeting
Only holders of shares of common stock of the Company at the close of business on March 1, 2019 (the "record date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. On the record date, there were 71,708,000 shares of common stock entitled to vote.  
You will have one vote for each share of common stock of the Company held by you on the record date.
BOK Financial | 5
In order to have a meeting it is necessary that a quorum be present. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as having voted either for or against a proposal.  
The affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the shareholders present or represented at the meeting in which a quorum is present and entitled to vote is required for approval of all matters other than election of directors. Directors are elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the shareholders present or represented at the meeting in which a quorum is present and entitled to vote for the election of directors, but if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (i.e. a contested election), the shareholders shall instead elect the directors by plurality vote of the shares present in person or by proxy.   
George B. Kaiser currently owns approximately 53.6% of the outstanding common stock and plans to vote all of his shares.
Solicitation of Proxies
We are paying for all our costs incurred in soliciting proxies for the annual meeting. In addition to solicitation by mail, we may use our directors, officers and regular employees to solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise.  These personnel will not be specifically compensated for these services. We will pay persons holding shares of common stock for the benefit of others, such as nominees, brokerage houses, banks, and other fiduciaries, for the expense of forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owner.
Annual Report
Our Annual Report to Shareholders, covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including audited financial statements, is enclosed. No parts of the Annual Report are incorporated in this Proxy Statement or are deemed to be a part of the material for the solicitation of proxies.

COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
RECOMMENDATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
ü The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which added a new section 14A to the Securities Exchange Act, shareholders can vote to approve, not less frequently than once every three years, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Proxy Statement. This is commonly known as a "say on pay" vote. This allows our shareholders the opportunity to communicate annually to the Board of Directors their views on the compensation of our named executive officers through the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
We are asking you to vote for the above resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers.  This vote is advisory in nature and non-binding; however, the Board of Directors will consider the shareholder vote when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Our "say on pay" vote is included in our Proxy Statement every year, and the vote on the frequency of the "say on pay" proposal is held every six years.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy, voted at the meeting, is required for the advisory approval of this resolution.

Attendance of Meetings 
The entire Board of Directors of BOK Financial met four times during 2018.  All directors of BOK Financial attended at least 75% of all meetings of the Board of Directors and committees on which they served. Although BOK Financial does not have a policy with respect to attendance by the directors at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, directors are encouraged to attend. Twenty-two of the twenty-two members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board of Directors intends to meet at least four times in 2019.
Director Nominations
While the Board of Directors does not have a standing nomination committee, director candidates identified by management and members of the Board of Directors are discussed regularly at Board of Directors meetings. The Board has adopted a written policy on qualifications of directors, which states that directors will have all of the following characteristics: (i) impeccable integrity, (ii) strong sense of professionalism, and (iii) capability of serving the interests of stockholders, along with several of the following characteristics: (i) prominence in the community, (ii) ability to represent the views of under-represented constituencies in the Company's market areas, (iii) financial analytical skill and expertise, and (iv) vision for social trends.
While the policy on director qualifications does not formally require diversity on the Board and the Company does not have a diversity policy, the policy states that the Board should encompass a diverse range of skill and expertise sufficient to provide prudent guidance to the Company, and have the right mix of characteristics and talents for the optimal functioning of the Board in its oversight of the Company. In considering a particular nominee, the Board will consider, in addition to the qualifications and characteristics described above, whether the potential director assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of background, perspective, and experience, including with respect to age, gender, race, place of residence, and specialized expertise.
The Board of Directors will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders if provided with the following: (i) evidence in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of compliance with stockholder eligibility requirements, (ii) the written consent of the candidate(s) for nomination as a director and verification as to the accuracy of the biographical and other information submitted in support of the candidate, (iii) a resume or other written statement of the qualifications of the candidate(s) for nomination as a director, and (iv) all information regarding the candidate(s) and the submitting stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement filed with the SEC if the candidate(s) were nominated for election to the Board of Directors. Any recommendations received from stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner that potential nominees suggested by Board members, management or other parties are evaluated. The Board of Directors encourages stockholder director candidate recommendations. 
Any stockholder that wishes to present a director candidate for consideration should submit the information identified above pursuant to the procedures set forth below under "Communication with the Board of Directors".

Director Independence 
The Board of Directors has determined that BOK Financial is a "controlled company," as defined in Rule 5615(c)(1) of the NASDAQ listing standards, based on Mr. Kaiser's beneficial ownership of approximately 53.6% of the outstanding common stock. Accordingly, BOK Financial is exempt from certain requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards, including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on the Company's Board of Directors and the requirements regarding the determination of compensation of executive officers and the nomination of directors by independent directors. Nevertheless, the Company maintains a substantial majority of independent directors, determines upper level management compensation through an independent board committee, and nominates new board members through board consensus. Further, the Audit Committee is comprised solely of independent board members. Further discussion regarding determination of independence may be found in the sections entitled "Audit Committee" and "Independent Compensation Committee".
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No voting member of the Compensation Committee has served as an officer of the Company, including its affiliates, at any time. None of our executive officers serve as a member of the Compensation Committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. None of our executive officers serve as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board's Compensation Committee.

Independent Director Meetings
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy of regularly scheduled executive sessions where independent directors meet separately from management. The independent directors plan to meet in executive session after all regularly scheduled Board of Directors meetings. The independent directors held four executive sessions during 2018.

Stockholders of the Company may communicate their concerns to the non-management directors in accordance with the procedures described below under "Communication with the Board of Directors." 
Communication with the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of BOK Financial believes that it is important for stockholders to have a process to send communications to the Board. Accordingly, stockholders who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors, or a particular director, may do so by sending a letter to the Director of Investor Relations of BOK Financial at P.O. Box 2300, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74192. The mailing envelope should contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Stockholder-Board Communication" or "Stockholder-Director Communication." Such letters should identify the author as a stockholder and state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board of Directors or certain specified individual directors. The Director of Investor Relations and the General Counsel will independently review the content of the letters. Communications which are constructive suggestions for the conduct of the business or policies of the Company will be promptly delivered to the identified director or directors. Communications which are complaints about specific incidents involving banking or brokerage service will be directed to the appropriate business unit for review. Director nominations will be reviewed for compliance with the requirements identified in the section of this proxy entitled "Director Nominations," and if meeting such requirements, promptly forwarded to the director(s) identified in the communication.

Report of the Audit Committee    
In 2018, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") oversaw the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Company's management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee discussed and reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting policies, reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
The Committee reviewed the Ernst & Young LLP opinion on the conformity of the audited consolidated financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles with Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm. This discussion included their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting policies, and other matters as required to be discussed with the Committee by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable regulations.  In addition, the Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the firm's independence from the Company, including matters in the firm's independence letter required by the PCAOB, and considered the compatibility of any non-audit services with the firm's independence.  
The Committee also reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP the results of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and the firm's audit of internal control over financial reporting. The Committee meets at least quarterly with the Company's internal auditors and Ernst & Young LLP, with and without management present, regarding the overall scope and plans for their respective audits and the results of those audits, including their evaluations of internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
The Committee is governed by a charter which is available for review at www.bokf.com.  Each of the members of the Committee qualifies as an "independent" Director under the current NASDAQ listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Board of Directors has appointed E. Carey Joullian IV as the "audit committee financial expert".  
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements and management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
The Committee and the Board have also recommended, subject to shareholder approval, the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

Audit Fees.  Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") for the audit of the annual consolidated financial statements included in BOK Financial's Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the review of the consolidated financial statements included in BOK Financial's Forms 10-Q for the quarters included in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and various subsidiary audits were $2,201,225 and $2,076,375 respectively.
Audit-Related Fees.  Fees paid to EY for SOC 1 reports and other audit-related functions were $506,325 and $296,575 respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The Audit Committee has a policy on auditor independence requiring the approval by the Committee of all professional services rendered by BOK Financial's independent auditor prior to the commencement of the specified services.  100% of the services described in "Audit Fees", "Audit-Related Fees", "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with BOK Financial's policy on auditor independence and approval of fees. 
Board Leadership Structure
The positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board are not held by the same person. Mr. Bradshaw, the President and Chief Executive Officer, brings Company-specific experience and expertise to the role, while Mr. Kaiser, the Chairman of the Board, brings experience, oversight, and expertise from outside the Company and industry. Mr. Kaiser is also the majority shareholder of BOK Financial, giving him additional incentive to ensure the success of the Company. Keeping the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman separate allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business, while allowing the Chairman to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and independent oversight of, management. The Board believes that having separate Chief Executive Officer and Chairman positions and having an outside director serve as Chairman is the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time, given the characteristics and circumstances of the Company, and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. It provides the appropriate balance between strategy development and independent oversight of management. 
Board Role in Oversight of Risk
The Board has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level (as disclosed in the descriptions of the committees in this Proxy Statement), in overseeing management of the Company's risks. The full Board maintains responsibility for general oversight of strategic risks, and regularly reviews information regarding the Company's credit, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Company's Independent Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company's compensation policies and programs. The Risk Committee manages enterprise-wide risk management programs including capital planning, liquidity, interest rate, and operations risk as well as compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  The Audit Committee manages risks associated with accounting and financial reporting and internal controls.  The Credit Committee manages risks associated with the Company's credit portfolio and credit-related policies.  While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors oversees overall strategic and reputational risks, and is regularly informed through committee reports and reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of various risks within the Company.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Compensation Program Overview
The BOK Financial executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain executives whose judgment, leadership abilities and special efforts result in successful operations for the Company and an increase in shareholder value. Various components of the program work together to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Reward sustained, above peer performance 
▪ Encourage both individual performance and teamwork 
▪ Link compensation to operational and strategic results  
▪ Align executive interests with shareholder interests 
▪ Discourage inappropriate risk taking 
▪ Keep BOK Financial compensation competitive with peer banks 
▪ Create long-term commitment to the Company 
[END TABLE]
The BOK Financial executive compensation program includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Salary 
▪ Executive Incentive Compensation (annual and long-term) 
▪ 401(k) Plan 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") has responsibility for establishing, implementing and approving the Company's general compensation philosophy with regard to the senior executive officers who participate in the Company's Executive Incentive Plan (referred to as the "Executive Incentive Plan" or the "Plan"). The Committee receives guidance from the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"), who assists in evaluating employee performance, recommending business performance targets and objectives and suggesting salary levels and awards for executives (other than himself). 
Throughout this proxy statement, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), and the three most highly compensated executive officers other than the CEO and CFO who were serving as executive officers at the end of the last completed fiscal year are referred to as the "named executives" or the "named executive officers".
2018 Executive Compensation Summary
No material changes were made to Executive Compensation in 2018.  In 2018, the Committee considered the results of the advisory vote by shareholders on the "say-on-pay" proposal presented to shareholders at the April 24, 2018 annual meeting. As reported in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 27, 2018, there was significant support by shareholders for the compensation program offered to the Company's named executive officers. Accordingly, the Committee made no direct changes to the Company's executive compensation program as a result of the say-on-pay vote. The Company's executive compensation program continued to focus on pay for performance, aligning executive interests with those of the Company's shareholders, achieving a balance between annual and long-term incentives and monitoring for the creation of incentives that create an excessive amount of risk.

Promoting Long-Term Growth and Discouraging Excessive Risk Taking
Review and Oversight of Risk
In 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and other regulatory agencies issued Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (the "Compensation Guidance"). In response, Company management formed a review committee consisting of members from human resources, audit, risk management, accounting, finance, legal, compliance and the various business lines (the "Incentive Risk Review Committee"). The Incentive Risk Review Committee undertook review of all the compensation plans of the Company in accordance with the Compensation Guidance. The Compensation Guidance required the Company to assess the balance of risk and reward in all compensation plans, the effectiveness of controls and risk management and the effectiveness of corporate governance, including Board of Director oversight. The Incentive Risk Review Committee reported to the Committee that the Company plans had a satisfactory balance of risk and reward and that controls, risk management and corporate governance were adequate. The Incentive Risk Review Committee reviews all new plans and any material changes to existing plans in accordance with the Compensation Guidance to continually assess the balance of risk and reward in the Company's compensation plans. The Incentive Risk Review Committee reports the results of this review to the Committee on an annual basis.   
Significant Equity Ownership
The stock ownership guidelines for executive management were reviewed and revised by the Committee in December 2014 from a fixed-share guideline to a multiple of base salary guideline. The purpose of the ownership guidelines is to encourage executive investment in the enterprise and to align the interest of the executive with those of long-term Company shareholders. Under the revised guidelines, each named executive is encouraged to retain ownership of shares equaling the following amount of his base salary:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive Name Multiple of Base Salary 
Steven G. Bradshaw 6 X base salary 
Steven E. Nell 5 X base salary 
Scott B. Grauer 4 X base salary 
Stacy C. Kymes 4 X base salary 
Norman P. Bagwell 4 X base salary 
[END TABLE]
The named executives were encouraged to comply with the BOKF Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines by April 1, 2018. All 5 named executives met the annual guidelines as of April 1, 2018. The Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines calculate stock ownership using a first quarter, 90-day average. The 90-day average per share price for the first quarter of 2018 was $96.39. The Committee reviews compliance with the Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines annually.  Unvested service shares, performance shares, and stock options do not count towards ownership.  For a further accounting of BOK Financial named executive equity ownership see the beneficial ownership table on page 7. Base salary may be found in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42.
Shareholder and President and Chief Executive Officer Emphasis on Long-Term Success
George B. Kaiser, the largest BOK Financial shareholder and Chairman of the BOK Financial Board, and Steven G. Bradshaw, BOK Financial President and Chief Executive Officer, emphasize a long-term approach to management, reducing pressure on executives to realize short-term gains to the detriment of overall long-term success.   
BOK Financial | 30
Recoupment of Incentive Compensation
Under the Plan, in the event incorrect financial information or results were used as a basis for calculation of incentive compensation under the Plan, the Board of Directors may direct remedial action including the forfeiture of unpaid incentive compensation and/or the restitution of paid incentive compensation. The Board of Directors may require forfeiture or restitution from any executive who is accountable for the incorrect financial information or results, as well as any executive who erroneously benefits from the incorrect financial information or results.
Evaluating Executive Compensation Relative to Peer and Overall Earnings Performance 
By basing the Executive Incentive Plan on peer bank comparison, the Company avoids penalizing executives for general industry and economic downturns and encourages executives to produce the best possible results in good and bad economic times. All of the named executives receive a percentage of their annual incentive based on the per share earnings growth ("EPS Growth") of the Company compared to peer banks' EPS Growth. In 2018, Bradshaw was eligible to receive 80% of his annual incentive based on EPS Growth, Nell - 60%, Bagwell - 40%, Kymes - 40% and Grauer - 40%, as more fully described under "Annual Incentive Bonus" on page 33. Long-term target compensation, as more fully described under "Long Term Incentive Compensation" on page 36, is based on comparison to the peer bank median, adjusted by the Committee, and is paid in restricted stock, which by the terms of the Plan are performance based. The Committee's goal has always been to provide competitive remuneration to executives to enable BOK Financial to hire and retain top talent. The Committee has reviewed previous years' earnings per share performance relative to the peer banks and compensation paid to named executives relative to compensation paid for similar positions at the peer banks.  
Factors Used for Establishing Executive Compensation
The following is an explanation of the primary data, metrics and criteria used by the Committee to determine compensation as more fully described in "Components of Compensation" below: 
Earnings Per Share Growth Compared to Peers
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EPS Growth is a component of the annual and long term incentive under the Executive Incentive Plan.   
• The Committee views EPS Growth as an important variable used in public markets to measure profitability and determine the Company's stock price and, thus, shareholder value. 
[END TABLE]
Business Performance
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Business  Performance" is determined by comparing the two year average actual financial contribution of a business unit of the Company to its planned performance. Business Performance targets are established using standard Company methodologies and approved annually by the Committee. 
• Linking compensation to Business Performance motivates executives to achieve superior results in their particular business units, contributing to Company-wide profitability. 
[END TABLE]
Strategic Objectives
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At the beginning of each year, the President and CEO meets with each of the named executives to establish individual strategic objectives. 
• Strategic Objectives focus the executive team on effectively managing risk and building organizational capability. 
• Progress is discussed with each executive periodically throughout the year. 
[END TABLE]
BOK Financial | 31
Peer Group Compensation Data
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's internal compensation group completes an annual peer review of executive compensation using publicly available information, including proxy statements.   
• The Committee uses this information to assist in setting salary and to establish annual and long-term compensation targets in accordance with the Plan.  
• The Committee annually updates the peer group of bank holding companies in accordance with the following guidelines that were updated at the end of 2015:  
• The peer banks will include only publicly-traded, SEC registered, United States bank holding companies (BHCs) with assets ranging from $10 billion smaller to $10 billion larger than BOKF, per the most recently filed annual report. 
• The peer group size will not be less than 14 nor greater than 24.  If asset range causes a group of less than 14 peers, the next BHC, greater or smaller in asset size, will be included in the peer group. 
• The Committee uses the peer group for determining comparable executive compensation and relative EPS Growth. 
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the Committee determined the "Peers" for the period ending December 31, 2018:

Components of Executive Compensation 
Comparable Executive Position
For purposes of determining salary and setting targets for both annual and long-term incentive, each named executive's position is compared to the Peers' executive positions, based upon information reported in shareholder proxy statements or third party compensation survey data (McLagan peer survey data for top corporate banking executives), as follows (each a "Comparable Executive Position"): the Company's CEO is compared against the chief executive officers of the Peers; the CFO is compared against the chief financial officers of the Peers; and Bagwell, Kymes, and Grauer are compared to highest paid positions (excluding the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer) of the Peers.
Salary 
In determining base salary, the Committee is directed by the Plan to compare the median base salary of each named executive to that of the Comparable Executive Position from either shareholder proxy statements of the Peers, or from a nationally recognized executive compensation survey in the case of a named executive whose Comparable Executive Position is not contained in the proxy statements of the Peers. Adjustments to base salary of a named executive may occur based upon a named executive's experience, scope and scale of position, performance history and effectiveness in building organizational capabilities. For 2018, the BOK Financial base salary for each of the named executives compared to the median of his Peer was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive Name BOKF Base Pay Compared to Peer Median for Comparable Executive Position
Executive Name BOKF Base Pay Compared to Peer Median for Comparable Executive Position
Steven G. Bradshaw 105% 
Steven E. Nell 115% 
Scott B. Grauer 103% 
Stacy C. Kymes 102% 
Norman P. Bagwell  101% 
[END TABLE]
Executive Incentive Compensation 
The Executive Incentive Plan allows the named executives, and certain executives that report directly to, or are designated by, the CEO, to earn (1) an annual cash incentive, which has historically been paid in the first quarter of the year following that to which the service relates, and (2) long-term incentive, which may be paid through the award of stock options, service-based restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, or a combination of service-based and performance-based restricted stock, or stock options, as determined by the Committee.  For 2018, the Committee elected to award long-term incentive in the form of restricted shares. No annual cash incentive for any one named executive may exceed $2,000,000. No more than 150,000 shares of restricted stock and 250,000 stock options may be issued to a single named executive in any one year. Share-based compensation is awarded on the second business Friday in January.

Annual Incentive Bonus
The "Annual Incentive Bonus" is determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) The target Annual Incentive Bonus for each named executive is determined annually by the Committee and is a percentage of base salary. The Committee reviews the median Annual Incentive Bonus for named executives' Comparable Executive Position and adjusts the target Annual Incentive Bonus based upon factors determined by the Committee such as years in the position, responsibilities and performance (the "Annual Incentive Target"). A named executive is entitled to 200% of his Annual Incentive Target if the Company's earnings per share for the performance period equals or exceeds $1.00 per share. The Committee may decrease the payout of the Annual Incentive Bonus based upon Earnings per Share Performance (described below) and Business Performance (described below) or such other factors as determined by the Committee. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii) "Earnings Per Share Performance" is the percentile ranking of the Company after (a) calculating the two year average earnings per share growth ("Average Growth") for each Performance Peer and for the Company and (b) ranking the Company's Average Growth compared to the Peers Average Growth, starting with the highest Average Growth and ending with the lowest Average Growth. A named executive shall earn that portion of his or her Annual Incentive Bonus based upon Earnings Per Share Performance (an "EPS Bonus") using a linear interpolation pursuant to which 0% of the EPS Bonus shall be earned if the Earnings Per Share Performance is below the 30th percentile, 33% of the EPS Bonus shall be earned if the Earnings Per Share Performance is at the 30th percentile, 100% of the EPS Bonus shall be earned if the Earnings Per Share Performance is at the 50th percentile, and 200% of the EPS Bonus shall be earned if the Earnings Per share Performance is at the 80th percentile or above, as illustrated in the following matrix: 
[END TABLE]
BOK Financial | 34
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii) A named executive shall earn that portion of his Annual Incentive Bonus based upon Business Performance (the "Business Performance Bonus") using a linear interpolation pursuant to which 0% of the Business Performance Bonus shall be earned if Business Performance is below 80%, 33% of the Business Performance Bonus shall be earned if 80% of Business Performance is achieved, 100% of the Business Performance Bonus shall be earned if 100% of Business Performance is achieved, and 200% of the Business Performance Bonus shall be earned if 120% or more of Business Performance is achieved as illustrated in the following matrix: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv) Each named executive is eligible to receive 20% of his Annual Incentive Bonus based on the Strategic Objective goal achievement.  The Strategic Objectives are established by the Chief Executive Officer and were reviewed and approved by the Committee on February 27, 2018 for service performed in 2018.  Strategic Objectives recognize the importance of focus by the named executive on effectively managing risk and building organizational capability.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(v) For 2018, the Annual Incentive Targets and payouts for the named executives are as follows:

(1) For 2018, BOKF Earnings per Share performance percentile rank was 92.8% based on the 2017 peer group.  This is above the 80th percentile maximum, resulting in a 200% payout. 
(2) Nell's Business Performance is based on overall Company performance; Grauer's Business Performance is based on the Wealth Management business unit performance; Kymes' Business Performance is based on the Commercial Banking business unit performance; and Bagwell's Business Performance is based on the Regional Banking unit performance.  Targets are established annually by standard Company methodologies. 
(3) At the February 26, 2019 Compensation Committee meeting, Bradshaw presented his detailed assessments of the executives' performance against the strategic objectives established by the Committee, and the Committee approved those achievement percentages.  Bradshaw's achievement percentage was determined by the Committee on that date. 
(4) Final payouts were approved by the Committee on February 26, 2019.

Long Term Incentive Compensation
"Long Term Incentive Compensation" is determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) The Long Term Incentive Compensation target amount for each Comparable Executive Position at each Peer is calculated based upon such Peers' latest proxy statements (the "Peer Long Term Incentive Compensation Amount").   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii) The Long Term Incentive Compensation awarded to each named executive is based upon the median of all the Peer Long Term Incentive Compensation Amounts corresponding to such Plan participant's Comparable Executive Position, adjusted by the Committee using such factors as years in the position, responsibilities, and performance. The amounts paid to the Executives as restricted stock awards may be found in column (e) of the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii) For 2018, the named executives were awarded the following percentage of Long Term Incentive Compensation:   
Executive Name 2018 LTI Target  (as a% of base)Performance-Based  (as a% of target)Service-Based  (as a% of target)
Executive Name 2018 LTI Target  (as a% of base)Performance-Based  (as a% of target)Service-Based  (as a% of target)
Steven G. Bradshaw 200% 100% - 
Steven E. Nell 110% 70% 30% 
Scott B. Grauer 110% 70% 30% 
Stacy C. Kymes 115% 70% 30% 
Norman P. Bagwell  105% 70% 30% 
[END TABLE]
Long Term Incentive Compensation is paid through the award of service-based restricted stock, performance-based restricted stock, or a combination of service-based and performance-based restricted stock, as determined by the Committee annually prior to March 15 of the applicable year. Service-based and performance-based restricted stock is issued pursuant to, and subject to the additional terms of (including restrictions and forfeiture), the BOK Financial Corporation 2009 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"). Performance-based restricted stock vests once such performance-based restricted stocks are earned as described in paragraph (ii) below and generally may not be transferred by the named executive until two years after vesting. Service-based restricted stock vests once such service-based restricted stocks are earned as described in paragraph (iv) below, and generally may not be transferred by the named executive until two years after vesting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) "Long Term Incentive EPS Performance" is the percentile ranking of the Company after (a) calculating the trailing three-year period earnings per share growth (determined as of the second anniversary of the end of the year in respect of which the performance-based restricted stocks were awarded) (the "Three Year EPS Average Growth") for each Performance Peer and for the Company and (b) ranking the Company's Three Year EPS Average Growth compared to the Peers' Three Year EPS Growth Average, starting with the highest Three Year EPS Average Growth and ending with the lowest Three Year EPS Average Growth.  
[END TABLE]
BOK Financial | 36
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii) Each annual award of performance-based restricted stocks is reviewed for performance as of the second year-end anniversary of the year in respect of which the performance-based restricted stocks were awarded (the "Reviewed Restricted Stocks"). A named executive shall earn Reviewed Restricted Stocks using a linear interpolation pursuant to which 0% of the Reviewed Restricted Stocks shall be earned if the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is below the 30th percentile, 33% of the Reviewed Restricted Stocks shall be earned if the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is at the 30th percentile, 100% of the Reviewed Restricted Stocks shall be earned if the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is at the 50th percentile, and 200% of the Reviewed Restricted Stocks shall be earned if the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is at the 80th percentile or above as illustrated in the following matrix: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii) In the event that the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is such that performance exceeds the target grant (e.g. 120% of target), the named executive receives an additional grant of performance-based restricted stock that equals the difference between the number of performance-based restricted stock that was granted at target and that which was earned pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph (ii) (e.g. 20%) (the "Shares Exceeding Target"). The vesting and transfer restrictions on the Shares Exceeding Target shall be equal in duration to the Reviewed Restricted Stock. In the event that the Long Term Incentive EPS Performance is such that performance does not exceed the target grant, the named executive shall forfeit the performance-based restricted stock received in accordance with the preceding paragraph (ii) but not earned by the named executive. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv) To the extent the Company's earnings per share for the year  in which service-based restricted stock are granted (the "Service-Based Performance Year") does not equal or exceed $1.00 per share (adjusted for stock dividends or distributions, recapitalizations, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, stock splits or the like), the named executive shall forfeit all the service-based restricted stock granted to him in such Service-Based Performance Year on or before March 15 of the year following the Service-Based Performance Year. To the extent the Company's earnings per share for the year following the grant of service-based restricted stock equal or exceed $1.00 per share (adjusted for stock dividends or distributions, recapitalizations, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, stock splits or the like), the named executive retains all the service-based restricted stock granted to him or her the previous year and such shares shall be earned and vest three years following the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
401(k) Plan 
Executives may contribute to the BOKF 401(k) Plan. Employee contributions are matched by the Company up to 6% of base compensation based on years of service and subject to 401(k) Plan limits. Named executives may direct the investments of their accounts in a variety of options, including BOK Financial common stock.

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Other than participation in the plans and programs described above, benefits which are very immaterial in nature and disclosed in footnote 4 to the Summary Compensation Table on page 42, or benefits which are provided to employees generally such as health and dental insurance, the Company does not provide perquisites or other personal benefits to named executive officers.  
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The BOK Financial executive compensation program has many objectives, all of which are designed to enhance Company value. Because no single type of compensation award or performance criteria could achieve all objectives, several types of compensation performance criteria and awards are used to achieve the maximum benefit from executive compensation.  
There is no pre-established policy or target for allocating executive compensation between cash and equity, long-term and short-term. Rather, the Committee considers its varied objectives, personal performance, Company performance and data regarding peer bank compensation to establish the appropriate level and mix of incentive compensation. The Committee has generally chosen not to consider the benefits to named executives from previously awarded compensation other than to establish a baseline for future compensation.
Company executive compensation objectives include:
Sustained, Above Peer Performance - BOK Financial rewards sustained above peer performance through the Executive Incentive Plan which uses comparative EPS Growth as a metric.
Individual Performance and Teamwork - Annual incentive compensation promotes individual performance with a percentage of annual incentive compensation being based on Business Performance (except for the CEO) and a percentage being based on EPS Growth, with potential downward adjustments for failure to meet individual performance goals. Long-term compensation, which is awarded entirely as equity, promotes teamwork by aligning all executives' interests with the success of the Company as a whole.   
Link Compensation to Operational Results - By using EPS Growth and Business Performance as the metrics for performance, both annual and long-term compensation are directly tied to financial performance of the Company. The Committee also considers the financial success of the Company when determining salary.
Competition with Peer Banks - To attract and retain superior executives, BOK Financial strives to provide levels of compensation comparable to competitor banks. The Committee considers peer compensation data when establishing salary and incentive compensation targets. 
Align Executive Interests with Shareholder Interests - While BOK Financial does not have a specific policy or target for determining the allocation between equity and cash awards, the Company does promote equity ownership to align executive interests with shareholder interests. All long-term executive compensation is paid in restricted stock. Stock ownership guidelines as described on page 30 require executives to retain a Company stock. 
BOK Financial | 38
Change in Control and Termination Benefits
The Company has a limited number of change in control benefits for executive officers. If an executive, or any employee of BOK Financial, is terminated within one year after a "change in control" (as defined in footnote 3 on page 49), and such termination is other than "for cause" (as defined in footnote 4 on page 49), then all unvested performance shares and stock options he or she has been granted vest. Stock options must then be exercised within 90 days of the change in control.  
Executive officers receive the same severance benefits as other BOK Financial employees which are based upon the amount of time a person has been employed by the Company. The named executives are entitled to receive additional severance pursuant to their employment agreements as more fully described in Potential Payments upon Termination found on page 48. The Company believes that the severance and termination payments help recruit and retain senior executives by protecting them in the event their positions are adversely impacted by an unexpected change in circumstance and are consistent with those offered by competitors.
Equity Grant Policy  
In 2006, the grant date became and remains the second business Friday in January (the "Grant Date").  All stock options awarded by BOK Financial are priced at the market value for BOK Financial common stock on NASDAQ as of the Grant Date. There is no program or policy to coordinate the granting of options with the release of material non-public information as all grants occur on the Grant Date, including those made to new executive officers.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code 
Both annual incentive and long-term awards made pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan were designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits to $1 million the amount that a publicly-held company is allowed to deduct each year for the compensation paid to each of the corporation's chief executive officer and three most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief financial officer.  The Tax Reform Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, eliminated the performance-based exception to the $1 million per-executive annual limit on the deductibility of compensation for certain public company executives under Section 162(m), expanded the scope and duration of covered employees and made other various revisions to Section 162(m).  The Act provided a grandfathering rule under which this change would not apply to performance-based compensation payable under a written and binding contract that was in effect as of November 2, 2017, as long as those contracts are not materially modified.  The Compensation Committee continues to consider the changes to Section 162(m) and actions the Compensation Committee will take, if any.  
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
If an executive is entitled to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and such benefits do not comply with Section 409A, then the benefits are taxable in the first year they are not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. In such case, the Service Provider is subject to regular federal income tax, interest and an additional federal income tax of 20% of the benefit included in the income. The Company believes all deferred compensation benefits currently comply with 409A.

2018 Pay Ratio Disclosure
For purposes of calculating the 2018 ratio of the median annual total compensation of all Company employees to the total annual compensation of the Company's chief executive officer, the Company included in its calculation of compensation: base salary, commissions, annual bonus amounts, stock-based compensation, and other incentive payments (including sign-on bonuses). Because there has been no change in employee population or compensation arrangement that would significantly effect the pay ratio disclosure since the Company last calculated the median compensation, the Company used December 31, 2017 as its measurement date.  On December 31, 2017, the Company had 4,950 employees nationwide, excluding the chief executive officer. Compensation amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2017. Total 2018 compensation for Steven G. Bradshaw, the Company's Chief Executive Officer was determined to be $4,813,469 and was approximately 67 times the median annual compensation of all Company employees (excluding the chief executive officer) of $72,056.

Pension Benefits
The normal retirement age under the BOK Financial Pension Plan (the Plan) is age 65. At that time, a participant may receive a lump sum equal to his or her account balance. In lieu of a lump sum payment, the participant may elect to receive an annuity payment from the Plan based on different optional forms of payments defined in the Plan.  Active participants also have the option to withdraw from the Plan at age 62.  
The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits in the Plan for the named executive officers:

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION REVIEW AND APPROVAL POLICY
BOK Financial has a written related party transaction policy, approved by the Audit Committee, which requires that all related party transactions reportable pursuant to SEC regulation S-K, Item 404(a) must be submitted to the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") for review. The Audit Committee conducts appropriate review and oversight of non-credit related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations in accordance with NASDAQ Rule 5630(a), and the Credit Committee reviews and oversees related party credit transactions. 
The related-party transaction must be intended for the benefit of the Company and made on terms no less favorable than those terms for unrelated persons. The CFO must also consider whether the transaction is occurring at arm's length and the impact of the related party transaction on financial statement accounting and disclosure.
If the CFO determines that the transaction would be material, he must present the details and his conclusion to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee will submit the related party transaction to the Audit Committee for approval based upon the same criteria as considered by the CFO, in addition to such criteria as may be deemed relevant by the members.
The Company annually requires each of its directors and executive officers to complete a directors' and officers' questionnaire that elicits information about related person transactions. The Company's Office of General Counsel reviews all transactions disclosed in the officer and director questionnaires and discusses any transactions not previously identified with the CFO and verifies compliance with independence requirements under NASDAQ Rule 5605 and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
Certain principal shareholders, directors of the Company and their associates were customers of and had loan transactions with BOK Financial or its subsidiaries during 2018.  All such loans (i) were made in the ordinary course of business, (ii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company, and (iii) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. As of December 31, 2018, none of these loans were classified as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problem loans. 
Certain related parties are customers of the Company for services other than loans, including consumer banking, corporate banking, risk management, wealth management, brokerage and trading, or fiduciary/trust services. The Company engages in transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business and in compliance with applicable regulation.
BOK leases office space in the Copper Oaks and Lewis Center facilities located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which are owned by Mr. Kaiser and affiliates. Lease payments for both facilities totaled approximately $971 thousand in 2018.  During 2018, the Company invested an additional $3.1 million in QRC Valve Distributors, LLC, which is indirectly owned by Mr. Kaiser.
