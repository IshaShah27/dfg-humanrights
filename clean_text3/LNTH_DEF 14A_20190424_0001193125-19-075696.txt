Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners as of the record date identified below. The mailing of the Notice to our stockholders is scheduled to begin on or about March 15, 2019.

This Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card or voting instruction card and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are each available at http://www.proxydocs.com/lnth. 
In this proxy statement, unless the context requires otherwise, the words "Lantheus," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Lantheus Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"), and we are, therefore, permitted to, and we intend to rely on, exemptions from certain disclosure requirements applicable to other public companies. For example, we are not required to provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on certain executive compensation matters on a non-binding advisory basis.  We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020 unless, prior to that time, we (i) have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, (ii) have a market value for our common stock held by non-affiliates of more than $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year when a determination is made that we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer," as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or (iii) issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Below are answers to common questions stockholders may have about the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting. 
What are the Proxy Materials? 
The "Proxy Materials" consist of the Notice, this proxy statement, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and (if you request paper copies) a proxy card/voting instruction form. 
What items will be voted on at the Annual Meeting and how does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote? 
There are three proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  elect three Class I directors to the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  approve an amendment to the Lantheus Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares  of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder by 825,000 shares; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm  for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Our amended and restated bylaws require that we receive advance notice of any proposals to be brought before the Annual Meeting by our stockholders. We have not received any such proposals. We do not anticipate any other matters will come before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders appointed by the Board will have discretion to vote on those matters. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote 
"FOR" each of the nominees in Proposal 1 and 
"FOR" Proposals 2 and 3. 
Who may vote at the meeting? 
Holders of shares of our common stock ("Shares") as of the close of business on February 26, 2019 (the "Record Date") may vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many Shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 38,628,501 Shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many votes do I have? 
Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each Share held as of the Record Date. 
What vote is required for each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under Delaware law and our bylaws, if a quorum exists at the meeting, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the  votes cast at the meeting is required for the election of Class I directors. This means that the three nominees receiving the largest number of "FOR" votes will be elected as Class I directors. We do not have cumulative voting.  Also see "Proposal 1: Election of Directors – Majority Voting Policy to Take Effect at Next Meeting."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The approval of an amendment to the Lantheus Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of  Shares reserved for issuance will be determined by a majority of the votes cast.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will be determined by a  majority of the votes cast.  
[END TABLE]
How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted? 
Abstentions (that is, Shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy that are voted "ABSTAIN") and broker non-votes (explained below) are counted for the purpose of establishing the presence of a quorum, but are not counted as votes cast "FOR" or "AGAINST." 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of Shares held in street name? 
Stockholder of Record. If your Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, then you are a "stockholder of record." 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your Shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a "beneficial owner of Shares" held in "street name." In that case, the organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the organization holding your account on how to vote the Shares you hold in your account. 
How do stockholders of record vote? 
There are four ways for stockholders of record to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet. You may vote via the Internet until 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on April 23, 2019,  which is the day before the Annual Meeting, by visiting www.proxydocs.com/lnth and entering the unique control number for your Shares located on the proxy card/voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By telephone. You may vote by phone until 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on April 23, 2019, which is the  day before the Annual Meeting, by calling 866-240-5317. You will need the unique control number for your Shares located on the proxy card/voting instruction form.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail. You may vote by filling out, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the  envelope provided. The completed proxy card must be received by the close of business on April 23, 2019, which is the day before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. You may also vote your Shares in person by completing a ballot at the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
How do beneficial owners of Shares held in street name vote? 
If you hold your Shares through a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, please follow the instructions of the organization that holds your Shares. 
Can I change my vote after submitting a proxy? 
Stockholders of record may revoke their proxy before the Annual Meeting by delivering to Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, Attention: Corporate Secretary, a written notice stating that a proxy is revoked, by signing and delivering a proxy bearing a later date, by voting again via the Internet or by telephone or by attending and voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Street name stockholders who wish to change their votes should contact the organization that holds their Shares.  If I hold Shares in street name through a broker, can the broker vote my shares for me? 
If you hold your Shares in street name and you do not vote, the broker or other organization holding your Shares can vote on certain "routine" proposals but cannot vote on other proposals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1 (election of Class I directors) is not considered a "routine" proposal. If you  hold Shares in street name and do not vote on Proposal 1, then your Shares will be counted as "broker non-votes" for that proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2 (amendment of the Lantheus Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan) is not considered a  "routine" proposal. If you hold Shares in street name and do not vote on Proposal 2, then your Shares will be counted as "broker non-votes" for that proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3 (ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm) is considered  a "routine" proposal. If you hold Shares in street name and do not vote on Proposal 3, then your Shares may be voted by your broker or other organization holding your Shares.  
[END TABLE]
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
The Company is paying the costs of the solicitation of proxies. Members of the Board, officers and employees and, potentially, Alliance Advisors, a third party proxy solicitor, may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, fax, email or in person. We will not pay directors, officers or employees any extra amounts for soliciting proxies. If we decide to retain a third party proxy solicitor, we would not expect to pay it more than $10,000 for any proxy solicitation services it renders. We may, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms, banks or similar entities representing street name holders for their expenses in forwarding Proxy Materials to their customers who are street name holders and obtaining their voting instructions. If you choose to access the Proxy Materials or vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges that you may incur. 
What do I need to do if I want to attend the meeting? 
You will need to provide evidence that you are a stockholder as of the Record Date. This can be a copy of your proxy card or a brokerage statement showing your Shares as of the Record Date. You should also bring photo identification. If you hold your Shares in street name and wish to vote in person at the meeting, you will need to contact the organization that holds your Shares in order to obtain a legal proxy from that organization. 
Where can I find voting results? 
We will file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC to report the final voting results from the Annual Meeting within four business days of the Annual Meeting. 
I share an address with another stockholder. Why did we receive only one set of Proxy Materials? 
Some banks, brokers and nominees may be participating in the practice of "householding" Proxy Materials. This means that only one copy of the Proxy Materials may be sent to multiple stockholders in your household. If you hold your Shares in street name and want to receive separate copies of the Proxy Materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact the bank, broker or other organization that holds your Shares. 
Upon written or oral request, the Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Proxy Materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of any of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the Proxy Materials, you can contact our Investor Relations department at 978-671-8842 or ir@lantheus.com or by writing to Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, Attention: Investor Relations.  What are the implications of being an "emerging growth company"? 
We are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are, therefore, permitted to, and we intend to rely upon, exemptions from certain disclosure requirements applicable to other public companies. For example, we are not required to provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote on certain executive compensation matters on a non-binding advisory basis. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2020 unless, prior to that time, we (i) have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, (ii) have a market value for our common stock held by non-affiliates of more than $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year when a determination is made that we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer," as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. 
Who should I contact if I have additional questions? 
You can contact our Investor Relations department at 978-671-8842 or ir@lantheus.com or by writing to Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, Attention: Investor Relations. Stockholders who hold their Shares in street name should contact the organization that holds their Shares for additional information on how to vote.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board is currently comprised of ten directors. In accordance with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (our "Charter"), our Board consists of three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III, with terms expiring in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Ms. Mary Anne Heino, Mr. Samuel Leno and Dr. Derace Schaffer are the Class I directors whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting. Our Board has nominated, and stockholders are being asked to elect, Ms. Heino, Mr. Leno and Dr. Schaffer for three-year terms expiring at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If elected, each of the nominees will hold office until our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and a successor is duly elected and qualified or until her or his earlier death, resignation or removal. 
The persons named as proxies will vote to elect each of these three nominees, unless a stockholder indicates that his or her Shares should be withheld with respect to any one or more of these nominees. 
In the event that any nominee for director becomes unavailable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote the proxies in their discretion for any nominee who is designated by the current Board to fill the vacancy. We do not expect that any of the nominees will be unavailable or will decline to serve. 
In determining that each director should be nominated for election, the Board considered her or his service, business experience, prior directorships, qualifications, attributes and skills described in the biography set forth below under "Corporate Governance—Executive Officers and Directors" and the criteria and diversity policy described under "Director Nomination Process and Diversity Policy." 
Vote Required 
Under Delaware law and our bylaws, if a quorum exists at the meeting, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting is required for the election of Class I directors. This means that the three nominees receiving the largest number of "FOR" votes will be elected as Class I directors. We do not have cumulative voting. 
Majority Voting Policy To Take Effect at Next Annual Meeting 
On October 18, 2018, upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board adopted a majority voting policy, providing that in the case of an uncontested election of directors in which a director nominee does not receive votes affirmatively cast "FOR" his or her election or re-election in excess of 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that nominee's election or re-election, that director will contingently tender his or her resignation, which, in accordance with the majority voting policy, the Board may in its sole discretion elect to accept. The majority voting policy will take effect beginning with the election of our Class II directors at our annual stockholders meeting in 2020. 
Board of Directors' Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE DIRECTOR

Board of Directors and Committee Meetings; Annual Meeting Attendance 
In 2018, the Board held seven meetings and acted by written consent in lieu of a meeting one time, the Audit Committee held six meetings, the Compensation Committee held six meetings and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held six meetings. During 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings held by the Board and those of its committees on which that director served. The non-employee directors of the Company regularly meet in executive session without management following adjournment of the meetings of the Board. Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles adopted by the Board, the independent Chairperson of the Board presides at those executive sessions, and those executive sessions must occur no less frequently than twice per year. 
We have no formal policy with respect to director attendance at our Annual Meetings of Stockholders, however, we encourage all directors to attend. All but one of our then-serving directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Director Independence 
The majority of the Board is comprised of independent directors. In addition, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are each comprised entirely of directors meeting the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Nasdaq audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committee independence requirements, as applicable. 
The Board has reviewed its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director and considered whether any director has a material relationship with the Company that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The Board has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Clemmer, Leno, Markison, Pruden and Pucel, Ms. McHugh and Drs. Robertson, Schaffer and Thrall is an "independent director" under the Nasdaq rules and Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(b)(1) and that none of those directors has relationships with the Company that would interfere with that director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director of the Company.  Board of Directors Leadership Structure and Over-Boarding Policy 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles, the Board currently requires the separation of the offices of the Chairperson of the Board and the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure and may make changes in the future. 
Also under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles, the Board currently prohibits a director from serving on more than five total public company boards (including our Board) and, if the director is the chief executive officer of a public company, then he or she may serve on no more than two other public company boards (other than his or her own). 
Our written Corporate Governance Guidelines and Principles adopted by the Board are available in the Corporate Governance section of our Investor Relations website at http://investor.lantheus.com. 
Board of Directors Role in Risk Oversight 
The Company's management is primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company. However, the Board believes that oversight of risk management is one of its fundamental responsibilities. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company's financial reporting process, internal controls over financial reporting and compliance programs. The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing compensation-related risks. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's corporate governance programs. The Financing and Strategy Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's capital structure and transactional-related risks. Management regularly reports to the Board and its committees on the risks that the Company may face and the steps that management is taking to mitigate those risks. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and discussing with our management our policies and processes with respect to risk assessment and risk management. With respect to cybersecurity risks, the Company has made and continues to invest in new services and technologies and provides employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cybersecurity risks, all in a manner reasonably intended to protect the Company against cybersecurity risks and security breaches. 
Board of Directors Committees 
The Board has the authority to appoint committees to perform certain management and administrative functions. Currently, the Board has four committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Financing and Strategy Committee.

Board of Directors and Committee Evaluations 
Each year, our Board and each committee conduct self-evaluations to evaluate their performance and effectiveness. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board the methodology for those evaluations and oversees their administration. Each member of the Board completes a questionnaire to assess that member's own performance and the performance of the Board and any applicable committee on which that member serves. The questionnaire seeks answers to questions based both on numerical ratings and qualitative comments. The collective comments and ratings are compiled for and reviewed by the Chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The results are discussed with the Board. 
Director Nomination Process and Diversity Policy 
Each year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends, and the Board proposes, a slate of director nominees to stockholders for election at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Stockholders may also nominate directors, as described below. 
The Board recognizes the value of appointing individual directors who bring a variety of diverse viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experiences and expertise to the Board. The Board believes that having a diverse board of directors fosters more productive and beneficial discussions and decision-making processes in support of the Company's strategic objectives. In 2018, as part of its review of best corporate governance practices, the Board adopted a formal diversity policy. A copy of our diversity policy is available on the Corporate Governance section of our Investor Relations website at http://investor.lantheus.com. Pursuant to our diversity policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, screening and recommending to the full Board for approval, potential director candidates. In selecting director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a range of matters of diversity, including race, gender, ethnicity, culture, thought, geography, education and competencies, with the goal of having a Board, which as a whole, reflects a range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the results of the Board and committee self evaluations described above, in making its nomination recommendations. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee values the input of stockholders in identifying director candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers recommendations for   Board candidates submitted by stockholders using substantially the same criteria it applies to recommendations from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, directors and members of management. The stockholder making the recommendation must follow the procedures and provide the information set forth in our amended and restated bylaws. 
Stockholders may submit recommendations by providing the person's name and appropriate background and biographical information by writing to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Stockholder nominations may be made at any time. However, in order for a candidate to be included in the slate of director nominees for approval by stockholders in connection with a meeting of stockholders and for information about the candidate to be included in the Company's proxy materials for such a meeting, the stockholder must submit the information required by our amended and restated bylaws and other information reasonably requested by the Company within the timeframe described in our amended and restated bylaws under "Additional Information—Procedures for Submitting Stockholder Proposals."

(1)  Mr. Marshall commenced employment with us on September 24, 2018. The amounts included in this table  include the amounts awarded to, earned by and paid to Mr. Marshall for the portion of 2018 during which he was employed by us.  
(2)  The dollar amounts in the stock awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value, calculated in  accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of restricted stock awards ("RSAs") subject to time-based vesting and RSAs subject to performance-based vesting ("PSAs"), excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures and, for PSAs, based  on the probable achievement of applicable performance conditions. The aggregate grant date fair value of PSAs granted in 2018, if applicable performance conditions were achieved at maximum levels, would be $1,900,013 for Ms. Heino, $394,494 for  Mr. Duffy, $404,954 for Dr. Orlandi and $461,265 for Mr. Crowley. The aggregate grant date fair value of PSAs granted in 2017, if applicable performance conditions were achieved at maximum levels, would be $1,315,516 for  Ms. Heino, $328,336 for Mr. Duffy, $212,861 for Dr. Orlandi and $297,804 for Mr. Crowley. The assumptions used to value these awards are described in Note 13 to our financial statements included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      This grant date fair value for stock awards granted in 2018 is higher than for 2017 due, in part, to a change in  assumptions used to value those awards and does not necessarily correspond to the actual value that will ultimately be realized by each named executive officer, which will likely vary based on a number of factors, including our financial  performance, stock price fluctuations and applicable vesting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      For 2018, the amount in the stock awards column for Mr. Crowley also includes the incremental fair value,  calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of RSAs that became vested in connection with his separation from the Company. See "Separation Agreement with Mr. Crowley" below for more information.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC ("Pearl Meyer"), an independent compensation consulting firm, to assist it in evaluating the Company's executive competitive compensation practices, including the identification of an appropriate peer group of publicly traded companies for executive compensation comparison purposes, reviewing data from peer group proxy statements and relevant market data from the Radford Life Sciences Survey on each element of executive and non-employee director compensation, developing guidance for each element, and reviewing the appropriateness of the recommendations submitted by management. Pearl Meyer received instruction directly from the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee.  We generally target the market fiftieth (50th) percentile for each element of compensation, as presented by Pearl Meyer in its market analysis based on the peer group and survey data described above. Our President and Chief Executive Officer assisted in developing, and presented to the Compensation Committee for its review and approval, management's recommendations for our compensation program and specific compensation for her direct reports, including our other named executive officers. 
Base Salary 
The base salaries of our named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:

 Mary Anne Heino    $ 675,000   
 Robert J. Marshall, Jr.    $ 405,000

 Cesare Orlandi    $ 418,000   
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentives 
Our 2018 Executive Leadership Team Incentive Bonus Plan, which the Compensation Committee adopted at the beginning of 2018, was intended to reward executive officers, including our named executive officers, for achieving corporate performance goals (i.e., a specified adjusted EBITDA target, which generally aligned to the Company's publicly announced financial guidance) and individual performance goals, unique to each executive's position. 
For 2018, each of our named executive officers had a target annual incentive payout amount, expressed as a percentage of that named executive officer's base salary. For 2018, these target annual incentive payout amounts were 85% for Ms. Heino, 55% for Mr. Marshall and 50% for Mr. Duffy and Dr. Orlandi, and was 55% for Mr. Crowley. The actual amount that each of our named executive officers received under our 2018 Executive Leadership Team Incentive Bonus Plan for 2018 is reported in the "Summary Compensation Table." 
For 2019, our Compensation Committee adopted the 2019 Executive Leadership Team Incentive Bonus Plan (the "2019 Executive Bonus Plan"), payouts under which are based on achievement of new corporate performance goals (i.e., specified Net Revenue, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow targets) and individual performance goals, again unique to each executive's position. For these compensation purposes, the corporate performance metrics are defined as follows, and are derived from the Company's financial statements, subject to any adjustments approved by the Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by "Net Revenue," we mean total revenue net of rebates and allowances;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by "Adjusted EPS," we mean consolidated net income of the Company, net of tax, but excluding  share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, asset impairment charges, restructuring charges, other charges associated with permitted acquisitions, charges and gains associated with product or business line  discontinuance, changes in contingent purchase price, legal settlements and other one-time, non-recurring charges which do not represent ongoing costs to the business;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by "Free Cash Flow," we mean cash provided by operating activities, less cash used for capital  expenditures.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee selected these particular measures of corporate performance to align our compensation program with our annual external financial guidance, and because the Compensation Committee believes that: (i) our long-term success depends on our ability to drive sustainable Net Revenue growth; (ii) Adjusted EPS is a key indicator of our operational performance and profitability and is the basis on which stockholders calculate growth expectations; and (iii) Free Cash Flow focuses management on generating cash, which can then be deployed in a disciplined manner to create shareholder value.  For 2019, the corporate performance metrics will be weighted as follows: Net Revenue, 40%; Adjusted EPS, 30%; and Free Cash Flow, 30%. Failure to attain a threshold level of any of the corporate performance metrics will preclude any payout for the corresponding portion of the bonus payable under the 2019 Executive Bonus Plan. Attainment of each performance metric is calculated independently. 
Cash LTIP 
Our Cash LTIP rewarded executive officers, including our named executive officers, for achieving certain specified, long-term financial, corporate and strategic performance goals, including certain annual revenue levels and operational goals. Achievement of performance goals under the Cash LTIP was measured as of September 1, 2017, and February 28, 2019, and cash payment was made after the Compensation Committee determined whether and the extent to which the applicable performance goals were achieved. 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee granted Cash LTIP awards to Ms. Heino, Mr. Duffy, Dr. Orlandi and Mr. Crowley with maximum cash payouts of $900,000, $220,000, $200,000 and $220,000, respectively. 
As a result of the achievement of certain performance goals in accordance with their terms under the Cash LTIP prior to September 1, 2017, the Company paid $270,000, $66,000, $60,000 and $66,000 to Ms. Heino, Mr. Duffy, Dr. Orlandi and Mr. Crowley, respectively, in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of the achievement of certain of the remaining performance goals in accordance with their terms under the Cash LTIP prior to February 28, 2019, the Company paid $360,000, $88,000 and $80,000 to Ms. Heino, Mr. Duffy and Dr. Orlandi, respectively, in the first quarter of 2019. Because Mr. Marshall joined the Company in 2018, he did not participate in our Cash LTIP. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
General 
The Board approved and adopted our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, each of which provides for grants of equity awards, including options to acquire Shares, RSAs, Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") subject to time-based vesting, PSAs and RSUs subject to performance-based vesting ("PSUs"). Since 2015, new grants of equity awards can only be made under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as it supersedes our previous plans. 
As described below, we have adopted Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines that impose retention requirements on equity grants made in and after 2019 to non-executive directors and executive officers, including our named executive officers, until that director or executive officer meets his or her required ownership stake. 
Time-Based and Performance-Based Annual Equity Awards 
Based on the recommendations by its independent consultant, Pearl Meyer, our Compensation Committee has adopted guidelines under which the Company grants annual equity awards to executives, including our named executive officers, consisting of 50% time-based equity awards and 50% performance-based equity awards (assuming target level achievement of applicable performance goals), with an aggregate grant date fair value determined commensurate with the executives' roles and in recognition of their individual performance during the prior year. In 2018, Ms. Heino was granted 60,126 RSAs and 60,127 PSAs (at target), Mr. Duffy was granted 12,483 RSAs and 12,484 PSAs (at target), Dr. Orlandi was granted 12,814 RSAs and 12,815 PSAs (at target) and Mr. Crowley was granted 14,596 RSAs and 14,597 PSAs (at target). These annual RSAs vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, and these annual PSAs cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, in an amount equal to a percentage of the target number of Shares determined in reference to the extent to which the Company has achieved specified performance goals. Both RSAs and PSAs are also generally subject to the recipient remaining employed at the Company on the vesting date. We believe that the cliff vesting of the PSAs also serves as a meaningful retention tool. This mix of time and performance-based equity incentives is   intended to keep us highly-competitive within the executive talent market, while ensuring executives are focused on longer-term organizational performance. In connection with his hire in September 2018, Mr. Marshall was granted 44,642 RSAs, which vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, generally subject to his continued employment with the Company on the applicable vesting date. 
In February 2018, in consultation with Pearl Meyer and based on its review of peer group of public companies and other survey data described above, the Compensation Committee changed the performance-based goals used in equity award grants, from revenue and EBITDA, to relative Total Shareholder Return ("rTSR") of the Company's common stock, as compared to other companies in the S&P SmallCap Healthcare Index over a three full calendar year performance period, starting with the calendar year in which the grant was made. The adoption of rTSR was intended to ensure management alignment and accountability towards long term shareholder value creation. The Compensation Committee utilized the same equity grant approach in 2019. 
The Compensation Committee granted executives rTSR PSAs as part of their annual equity grants in 2018 and rTSR PSUs as part of their annual equity grants in 2019, with each award giving the recipient the right to earn or receive one share of common stock of the Company with respect to each rTSR PSA or PSU (as applicable) awarded, generally subject to the holder's continued employment with the Company on the vesting date. The relative changes in share prices during the performance period will be measured using the average closing prices during the 30 days preceding the beginning and the end of the performance period. The percentage of the target number of Shares that can vest under the rTSR PSAs and rTSR PSUs, will be as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Company's TSR Percentile Rank    Vesting Percentage of Target No. of Shares 
 Below 25th Percentile    0% 
 25th Percentile    50% (threshold) 
 50th Percentile    100% (target) 
 75th Percentile or Above    200% (maximum) 
[END TABLE]
In the event that the Company's rTSR percentile rank for the performance period falls between any of the thresholds set forth above (to the extent greater than the threshold and lower than the maximum), the vesting percentage will be determined by linear interpolation between those thresholds. 
Treatment of Awards Upon a Change of Control 
A change of control of the Company would accelerate the vesting of the unvested equity awards under our plans in certain circumstances as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Unvested options, RSAs, RSUs and PSAs granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan vest in full  (i) immediately prior to a change of control transaction in which the proceeds are all cash and, (ii) if the acquirer assumes, or substitutes its own equity award for, any such award, upon termination of the grantee's employment  without cause or resignation for good reason within twelve (12) months of that change of control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to unvested rTSR PSAs or PSUs, upon a change of control transaction, the Compensation Committee will  determine the extent to which applicable performance criteria have been achieved as of the date of the change of control as if the performance period end date applicable to the rTSR PSAs or PSUs was the date of the change of control and will  determine the number of rTSR PSAs or PSUs that will be deemed earned. Earned rTSR PSAs or PSUs will vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. The earned rTSR PSAs or PSU will vest immediately if the acquirer assumes, or substitutes  its own equity award for, any such award, upon termination of the grantee's employment without cause or resignation for good reason within twelve (12) months of that change of control  
[END TABLE]
 Clawback Under 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
Under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, if a participant receives compensation pursuant to an award calculated by reference to financial statements that are subsequently required to be restated in a way that would decrease the value of that compensation, the participant will, upon our written request, forfeit and repay to us the difference between what the participant received and what the participant should have received based on the restated accounting, in accordance with (i) our compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy, as may be in effect from time to time, and (ii) any compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy made applicable by law, including the Dodd-Frank Act.

Retirement Plans 
We offer a 401(k) qualified defined contribution retirement plan in which our employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate, with a 75% employer match of each participant's contributions up to 6% of the participant's eligible compensation. We do not offer any other qualified or non-qualified retirement plans. 
Other Benefits 
Our welfare and employee-benefit programs are the same for all of our eligible employees, including our named executive officers, and our named executive officers do not receive additional benefits outside of those offered to our other employees. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

Employment Agreements; Severance and Potential Payments 
Upon Termination or Change of Control 
As of December 31, 2018, Ms. Heino, Mr. Duffy and Dr. Orlandi were each party to an employment agreement that provided severance payments and benefits in the event of a termination of the named executive officer's employment by the Company without cause (as defined in the applicable agreement) in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the executive's annual base salary on the date of termination of employment, (ii) a pro rata portion (based upon the percentage of the fiscal year elapsed through the date of the executive's termination of employment) of a specified percentage of the executive's base salary (85% for Ms. Heino, 50% for Mr. Duffy, 50% for Dr. Orlandi), which amounts described in clause (i) and (ii) would be payable in substantially equal installments over a 12-month period, and (iii) an amount equal to the Company's portion of the COBRA premiums for 12 months, in addition to any earned and unpaid bonus for the year preceding termination of employment, earned and unpaid base salary and unreimbursed business expenses. In the event of a termination of the named executive officer's employment by the Company without cause or resignation by the executive for good reason within 12 months following a change of control (each, as defined in the applicable agreement), the named executives officer would be entitled to the severance described in the preceding sentence, except that the amount described in clause (ii) would be the full bonus amount (i.e., not pro rated for the partial year). In addition, a change of control of the Company would result in the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested equity awards under our plans in certain circumstances, as described under "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" above. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee, working with Pearl Meyer, evaluated our executive compensation practices, including our severance arrangements in comparison to our peer group of public companies and the salary survey information referenced above. The Compensation Committee then recommended, and the Board subsequently authorized, management to implement, modifications to our severance arrangements, including for our current named executive officers. Effective as of January 25, 2019, these modifications have been implemented and apply to our President and Chief Executive Officer and her direct reports at the Senior Vice President level and above, including Mr. Marshall, Mr. Duffy and Dr. Orlandi. In exchange for being bound by certain restrictive covenants and providing a release and waiver in favor of the Company, in the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason, these new arrangements provide for the following severance payments and benefits: (i) one times annual base salary, plus a prorated portion of the target annual bonus in effect on the date of separation and an amount equal to the Company's portion of COBRA premiums for up to 12 months following such termination of employment, in the event that the senior executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason other than after a change of control; and (ii) two times annual base salary, plus two times the full-year target annual bonus in effect on the date of separation and an amount equal to the Company's portion of COBRA premiums for 24 months following such termination of employment, in the event that the senior executive is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months of a change of control with all unvested stock options and other equity-based awards also vesting in full (with performance-based equity awards vesting at target levels of achievement).  The table below quantifies the amounts that would have become payable under each named executive officer's employment agreement and equity award agreements if, on December 31, 2018, a change of control had been consummated and the named executive officer's employment was terminated without cause or the named executive resigned for good reason under the agreements in place on January 25, 2019, as described above. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events discussed above, any actual amounts paid may be different. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the cost of benefits, the named executive officer's base salary and our stock price.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Additional Amount for Ms. Heino consists of (i) $1,822,500 in cash severance and (ii) the  acceleration of RSAs and PSAs having a market value (based on a closing stock price of $15.65 as of December 31, 2018) of $6,912,699.  
(2)  The Additional Amount for Mr. Marshall consists of (i) $850,500 in cash severance and (ii) the  acceleration of RSAs and PSAs having a market value (based on a closing stock price of $15.65 as of December 31, 2018) of $698,647  
(3)  The Additional Amount for Mr. Duffy consists of (i) $814,000 in cash severance, (ii) the acceleration  of RSAs and PSAs having a market value (based on a closing stock price of $15.65 as of December 31, 2018) of $1,777,574.

[END TABLE]
No compensation is due to our named executive officers upon a change of control that is not followed by a qualifying termination of employment, other than as described above or as required by applicable law. 
In addition, each of the severance arrangements with our named executive officers provides for a modified cut-back in the event that adverse tax consequences are imposed on the receipt of parachute payments by the named executive officer pursuant to Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). If any payments or benefits from the Company in the nature of compensation that are paid to or for the named executive officer's benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to his or her employment agreement or otherwise (each, a "Payment"), would subject the named executive officer to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Payments will be reduced to the greatest amount of the Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax (the "Reduced Amount"). However, if the amount of the Payments the named executive officer would receive after payment of all applicable taxes, including any excise taxes, is greater than the Reduced Amount, then no such reduction will occur. 
Separation Agreement with Mr. Crowley 
In connection with his separation from the Company in September 2018, Mr. Crowley entered into a separation agreement with the Company under which Mr. Crowley received (i) a cash severance payment of $656,550, representing his annual base salary, target annual bonus and the portion of his cash long-term incentive plan award that had been achieved, (ii) reimbursement for COBRA premiums and up to $25,000 of outplacement benefits for up to twelve months following his separation date, and (iii) accelerated vesting of 40,838 unvested RSAs, subject to transfer restrictions through the original vesting dates of such awards or an earlier change in control, in addition to any amounts required by law or the terms of the Company's policies and benefit plans. The separation agreement included a confirmation of the restrictive covenants to which Mr. Crowley was subject, including confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, no-hire and invention assignment covenants, and a release of claims in favor of the Company, its affiliates and certain other persons.  Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved and adopted, Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines ("Guidelines"). Under these Guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO and the executive officers who directly report to her are required to acquire and hold (vested) shares of  our common stock in an aggregate value at least equal to a specified multiple of his or her base salary, as determined by his or her position. The multiple ranges from one times base salary for certain of our executive officers, to three times base  salary for our CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additionally, our non-employee directors are required to acquire and hold  (vested) shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to three times their annual Board cash retainer.  
[END TABLE]
Until a director or executive officer achieves his or her required ownership level, he or she is required to retain 50% of all after-tax Shares issued upon (i) exercise of any vested Company stock option award (calculated on a net exercise basis) or (ii) the vesting of any other Company stock incentive award (such as the RSAs, RSUs, PSAs and PSUs described above). These retention requirements apply to new equity award grants commencing in 2019. 
Our executive officers and non-employee directors are required to comply with the Guidelines within five years of when the Guidelines apply to them. As of February 26, 2019, Messrs. Markison, Clemmer and Leno, Ms. McHugh and Drs. Robertson and Schaffer, and Ms. Heino and Mr. Duffy each had already achieved the requirements under the stock ownership guidelines. 
A copy of our Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines is available on the Corporate Governance section of our Investor Relations website at http://investor.lantheus.com.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
For 2018, each of our non-employee directors was eligible to receive the following annual compensation in cash (which is paid quarterly in advance and prorated for partial periods of service) for services as a director and, as applicable, Board committee member: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each director receives an annual fee of $50,000, and the Chairperson of the Board receives an additional annual  fee of $62,500;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each member of the Financing and Strategy Committee receives an annual fee of $5,000, and the Chairperson of the  Financing and Strategy Committee instead receives an annual fee of $7,500.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee periodically engages Pearl Meyer to review the Company's outside director compensation program. The review covers the levels of cash and equity retainers that are provided to outside directors, as well as the overall structure of the program, against the same peer group of public companies used for executive compensation benchmarking purposes. The independent consultant makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee for consideration, and the Compensation Committee subsequently recommends any changes to the outside director compensation program for the Board's approval. After reviewing the results of a compensation study prepared by Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, an increase to the annual fee for each member of the Nominating and Governance Committee to $5,000 for 2019. 
Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive separate or additional compensation for their services as directors or committee members. 
In 2018, each non-employee director was granted 7,911 RSAs under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. These 2018 awards vested in full on March 5, 2019. On February 26, 2019, each non-employee director was granted 5,353 RSUs under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. These 2019 annual equity awards will vest in full on February 26, 2020, generally subject to continued service through that date. 
All directors are subject to the Company's Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines described above. 
Non-employee directors are also entitled to reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with rendering those services for so long as they serve as directors.  The following table shows compensation paid to the individuals who served as our non-employee directors in 2018:

(1)  Ms. Heino does not receive any additional compensation for her service as a director and is not listed in  the table above. For information regarding Ms. Heino's 2018 executive compensation, see "Summary Compensation Table" above.  
(2)  The amounts in the stock awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value, calculated in accordance  with FASB ASC Topic 718, of RSAs, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. The aggregate grant date fair value of RSAs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the our common stock on the date of grant, multiplied by the number of  Shares subject to the award granted, for each RSA grant made during the year. This grant date fair value does not necessarily correspond to the actual value that will ultimately be realized by each director, which will likely vary based on a number  of factors, including our financial performance, stock price fluctuations and applicable vesting.  
(3)  On March 5, 2018, Mr. Markison was granted 7,911 RSAs. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Markison  held (a) 7,911 unvested RSAs and (b) outstanding options to purchase 58,913 Shares, of which options to purchase 58,913 Shares were vested.

 STOCK OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock held by (i) each of our directors, (ii) each of our named executive officers, (iii) our directors and named executive officers as a group and (iv) each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock. For our directors and officers, the information is as of the Record Date, February 26, 2019. For other stockholders who own more than 5% of our common stock, the information is as of the most recent Schedule 13G filed by each of those stockholders with the SEC. 
Beneficial ownership of Shares is determined under rules of the SEC and generally includes any Shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Except as noted by footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe based on the information provided to us that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Shares shown as beneficially owned by them. 
Percentage of beneficial ownership is calculated in part based on 38,628,501 Shares outstanding as of February 26, 2019. Shares subject to RSAs that are currently vested or that will vest within 60 days of the date of this proxy statement, and stock options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this proxy statement, are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those RSAs and options for the purposes of computing the percentage of beneficial ownership of that person and any group of which that person is a member, but are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of beneficial ownership for any other person. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the address for each holder listed below is c/o Lantheus Holdings, Inc., 331 Treble Cove Road, North Billerica, MA 01862.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors, certain executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company's Shares, to file reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. These persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. We assist our directors and executive officers with their Section 16(a) filings. Based solely on a review of reports filed with the SEC and written representations from directors and executive officers, we believe that all required reports under Section 16(a) with respect to those persons were timely filed during 2018.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
This section describes certain relationships and related person transactions between us or our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and our directors, director nominees, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our voting securities and certain related persons of any of the foregoing, on the other hand, since January 1, 2018. 
Indemnification Agreements 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify each director and executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including indemnification of expenses, such as attorneys' fees, judgments, penalties, fines and settlement amounts, actually and reasonably incurred by the director or executive officer in any action or proceeding, including, without limitation, all liability arising out of negligence or active or passive wrongdoing by that officer or director, in any action or proceeding by or in right of us, arising out of the person's services as a director or executive officer, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. At present, we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, executive officers, employees or agents in which indemnification would be required or permitted. We believe these indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers. 
Policies for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
We have a written policy relating to the approval of related person transactions pursuant to which the Audit Committee reviews and approves or ratifies all relationships and related person transactions between us and (i) our directors, director nominees and executive officers, (ii) any 5% record or beneficial owner of Shares or (iii) any immediate family member of any person specified in (i) or (ii) above. Management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from our directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions, and the Audit Committee is primarily responsible for determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether we have, or a related person has, a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. 
As set forth in our related person transaction policy, in the course of its review and approval or ratification of a related person transaction, the Audit Committee will consider: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the material terms of the transaction, including, without limitation, the amount and type of transaction; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the importance of the transaction to us.  
[END TABLE]
Any member of the Audit Committee who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review will not be permitted to participate in the approval or ratification of the transaction. However, that member of the Audit Committee will provide all material information concerning the transaction to the Audit Committee.  PROPOSAL 2: 
Amendment to 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
We are seeking stockholder approval to amend the Lantheus Holdings, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended to date, the "2015 Equity Incentive Plan") to increase the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan by an additional 825,000 Shares. We are not seeking stockholder approval of any other changes to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. 
We believe that our continuing ability to offer equity incentive awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is critical to our ability to attract, motivate and retain key individuals who are critical to our long term success, particularly as we grow and in light of the highly-competitive market for talent in which we operate. 
The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to approve this proposal. As such, the Board has approved the amendment to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of Shares available thereunder, subject to stockholder approval, and recommends that stockholders vote in favor of this proposal at the Annual Meeting. Stockholder approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Shares that are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
If stockholders approve this proposal, the amendment to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of Shares available thereunder will become effective as of the date of stockholder approval. If stockholders do not approve this proposal, the amendment to 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will not take effect and our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will continue to be administered in its current form. Our executive officers and directors have an interest in this proposal by virtue of their being eligible to receive equity awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The remainder of this discussion, when referring to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, refers to the amended 2015 Equity Incentive Plan as if this proposal was approved by our stockholders, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise references the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan prior to this proposed amendment. 
Background 
The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan was initially adopted in June 2015 with an initial Share reserve of 2,415,277 Shares, which was increased by 2,140,000 Shares in April 2016 and by an additional 1,200,000 Shares in April 2017 following Board and stockholder approvals. In February 2019, in order to implement additional best corporate governance and compensation practices, our Compensation Committee approved another amendment to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prohibit the payment of dividends or other distributions accruing on unvested equity awards prior to the time the  underlying award vests; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a minimum 12-month period to elapse before any portion of  unvested equity awards can vest (subject to certain exceptions, including for a death, disability, change of control, terminations of employment in connection with a change of control and otherwise for up to 5% of the Shares reserved for issuance).   
[END TABLE]
The February 2019 amendment (a copy of which is included on page A-27 of Appendix A), which applies to all new equity awards granted after its adoption, is currently effective and not subject to stockholder approval. 
Any Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that expire or are otherwise forfeited to the Company (other than Shares withheld by the Company to satisfy exercise price or tax withholding payment obligations) become available again for future grant under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. 
As of March 1, 2019, taking into account our expected 2019 grants, approximately 1,341,200 Shares remain available for grant under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The Board believes that additional Shares are necessary to meet the Company's currently anticipated equity compensation needs for approximately the next two years following the Annual Meeting. This estimate is based on a forecast that takes into account the anticipated rate of growth in hiring, an estimated range of our stock price over time and our historical forfeiture rates.  Reasons for Voting for the Proposal 
Long-Term Equity is a Key Component of our Compensation Objective 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delivering competitive equity value to our management team is essential to attracting and retaining the quality  of talent required for us to achieve our financial, operating and strategic objectives. We compete for this talent with a significant number of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other life sciences companies in Massachusetts that offer substantial  equity grant programs. We strongly believe that hiring and retaining key talent is very much in the interests of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity awards incentivize our employees to manage our business as owners, aligning their interests with the  long-term interests of our stockholders. Equity awards, the value of which depend on our stock performance and which require continued service and/or performance over long periods of time before any value can be realized, help achieve these  objectives and are a key element of our compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity awards allow us to preserve our cash resources.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe that, for investors, a combination of equity and cash compensation optimizes the Company's  valuation and properly incentivizes executives by linking their pay to Company performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If we do not obtain stockholder approval to increase the available pool, the Company anticipates that it will  have an insufficient number of Shares to make equity-based compensation a meaningful part of our employees' and officers' overall compensation. As such, the Company believes its ability to retain and attract talented employees will be  adversely affected.  
[END TABLE]
Our Company is Committed to the Effective Utilization of Shares 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee has engaged Pearl Meyer, an independent compensation consulting firm, to assist us in  our periodic evaluation of market competitive practices and optimal share utilization.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In February 2018, following consultation with Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee changed the performance  metrics under our equity compensation program from specified revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance goals, to rTSR goals. This change was intended to better align management's interests with the long-term interests of stockholders and to  manage our limited share reserve under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, while taking into account competitive compensation practices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In determining the amount of Share increase requested by this proposal, our Board considered the historical  number of equity awards granted by the Company in the past three years, as described in the following table:  
[END TABLE]

 Our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is consistent with principles of good corporate governance 
The Board believes that the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will promote the interests of stockholders and is consistent with principles of good corporate governance, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Evergreen Share Pool. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan does not include an "evergreen" share  pool that would increase the number of Shares available without stockholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Discounted Stock Options or SARs. All stock option and stock appreciation rights awards under the 2015  Equity Incentive Plan must have an exercise or base price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Repricing. Other than in connection with a change of control or dilutive events, the 2015 Equity  Incentive Plan prohibits any repricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Share Recycling. Shares underlying stock options and other awards issued under the 2015 Equity  Incentive Plan will not be recycled into the Share pool if they are withheld in payment of the exercise price of the award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in respect of the award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimum Vesting Periods. New awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to a minimum 12-month vesting period (subject to certain exceptions, including for a death, disability, change of control, terminations of employment in connection with a change of control and otherwise for up to 5% of the  Shares reserved for issuance).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Dividends on Unvested Awards. Dividend and dividend equivalents may not be paid on a current basis on  unvested awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Single-Trigger Change of Control Acceleration. Awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan do not  automatically accelerate upon a change of control (except for awards granted to non-employee directors that have one-year time-based vesting).  
[END TABLE]
The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan Requires Additional Shares to Meet our Forecasted Needs 
We expect to grant equity awards representing approximately 631,000 Shares during 2019 (representing approximately 1.6% of our outstanding Shares as of March 1, 2019). We anticipate limited forfeitures and cancellations under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, consistent with our previous history. Forfeitures of awards under our previous equity plans cannot be credited to replenish the Shares available for grant under the 2015 Equity Plan. 
As a result, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, concluded that increasing the number of Shares available for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan would provide the Company with the ability to undertake the flexible and balanced approach of using equity and cash compensation as needed to help us retain and motivate employees, which furthers stockholder interests. 
Summary of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 
The following is a summary of the material features of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan as set forth in Appendix A. 
Administration 
The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or another committee of the Board, comprised of no fewer than two members of the Board who are appointed by the Board to administer the plan, or, subject to the limitations set forth in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, the Board (the appropriate body is referred to as the "Committee"). Subject to the limitations set forth in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, the Committee has the authority to determine the persons to whom awards are to be granted, prescribe the restrictions, terms and conditions of all awards, interpret the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and adopt sub-plans and rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan.  Reservation of Shares 
Subject to adjustments as described below, the maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, will be equal to 6,580,277 (including the 825,000 additional Shares proposed to be added pursuant to the amendment to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan as set forth in this Proposal 2); provided, that no more than 20% of the Shares may be granted as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. Any Shares issued under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will consist of authorized and unissued Shares or treasury shares. 
In the event of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to common stock, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, spin-off, stock purchase, or other similar corporate change or any other change affecting common stock, equitable adjustments will be made to the number and kind of Shares available for grant, as well as to other maximum limitations under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and the number and kind of Shares or other terms of the awards that are affected by the event. 
Share Counting 
Awards that are required to be paid in cash pursuant to their terms will not reduce the Share reserve. To the extent that an award granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is canceled, expired, forfeited, surrendered, settled by delivery of fewer Shares than the number underlying the award, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of the Shares, the Shares retained by or returned to us will (i) not be deemed to have been delivered under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, (ii) be available for future awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and (iii) increase the Share reserve by one Share for each Share that is retained by or returned to us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares that are (x) withheld from an award or separately surrendered by the participant in payment of the exercise or purchase price or taxes relating to such an award or (y) not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right will be deemed to constitute delivered shares, will not be available for future awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and will continue to be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining whether award limits have been attained. If an award is settled in cash, the number of Shares on which the award is based will not count toward any individual Share limit, but will count against the annual cash performance award limit. Awards assumed or substituted for in a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock or reorganization will not reduce the Share reserve. 
Eligibility 
Awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan may be granted to any of our employees, directors, consultants or other personal service providers or any of the same of our subsidiaries. The plan allows grants to consultants and other personal service providers, however, this has not been the Company practice. 
Stock Options 
Stock options granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan may be issued as either incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, or as nonqualified stock options. The exercise price of an option will be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of the grant of the option. The Committee will determine the vesting and/or exercisability requirements and the term of exercise of each option, including the effect of termination of service of a participant or a change in control. The vesting requirements may be based on the continued employment or service of the participant for a specified time period or on the attainment of specified business performance goals established by the Committee. The maximum term of an option will be 10 years from the date of grant. 
To exercise an option, the participant must pay the exercise price, subject to specified conditions, (i) in cash, or, to the extent permitted by the Committee, and set forth in an award agreement, (ii) in Shares, (iii) through an   open-market broker-assisted transaction, (iv) by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the stock option, (v) by combination of any of the above methods or (vi) by any other method approved by the Committee must pay any required tax withholding amounts. All options generally are nontransferable. 
Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions and the change in control provisions of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, without the prior approval of our stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board will (a) cancel a stock option in exchange for cash or another award when the exercise price per Share under such stock option then exceeds the fair market value of one Share, (b) cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a stock option that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of that stock option or (c) otherwise approve any modification to a stock option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by NASDAQ or other principal exchange on which our common stock is then listed. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
A stock appreciation right may be granted either in tandem with an option or without a related option. A stock appreciation right entitles the participant, upon settlement or exercise, to receive a payment based on the excess of the fair market value of a Share on the date of settlement or exercise over the base price of the right, multiplied by the number of Shares as to which the right is being settled or exercised. Stock appreciation rights may be granted on a basis that allows for the exercise of the right by the participant or that provides for the automatic payment of the right upon a specified date or event. The base price of a stock appreciation right may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. The Committee will determine the vesting requirements and the term of exercise of each stock appreciation right, including the effect of termination of service of a participant or a change in control. The vesting requirements may be based on the continued employment or service of the participant for a specified time period or on the attainment of specified business performance goals established by the Committee. The maximum term of a stock appreciation right will be ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may be payable in cash or in Shares or in a combination of both. All stock appreciation rights generally are nontransferable. 
Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions and the change in control provisions of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, without the prior approval of our stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board will (a) cancel a stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or another award when the base price per Share under that stock appreciation right then exceeds the fair market value of one Share, (b) cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a stock appreciation right that would have the effect of reducing the base price of that stock appreciation right or (c) otherwise approve any modification to a stock appreciation right that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by NASDAQ or other principal exchange on which our common stock is then listed. 
Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs) 
RSAs represent Shares that are issued subject to restrictions on transfer and vesting requirements. The vesting requirements may be based on the continued service of the participant for a specified time period or on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the Committee, and vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances, as determined by the Committee. RSA holders will not be entitled to dividends or other distributions, if at all, until underlying Shares have vested and, unless otherwise set forth in an award agreement, will not have any of the other rights of a stockholder (including, the right to vote), unless and until those Shares vest. Any dividends with respect to an RSA that is subject to performance-based vesting will be subject to the same restrictions on transfer and vesting requirements as the underlying RSA. Until the applicable restrictions are removed or have expired, all RSAs are generally nontransferable.  Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 
RSUs provide the participant the right to receive a payment based on the value of a Share. RSUs may be subject to vesting requirements, restrictions and conditions to payment. RSUs may vest based solely on the continued service of the participant for a specified time period. In addition, RSUs may be denominated as PSUs and may vest in whole or in part based on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the Committee. The vesting of RSUs and PSUs may be accelerated in certain circumstances, as determined by the Committee. RSU and PSU awards will become payable to a participant at the time or times determined by the Committee and set forth in the award agreement, which may be upon or following the vesting of the award. RSU and PSU awards are payable in cash or in Shares or in a combination of both. RSUs and PSUs may be granted together with a dividend equivalent right with respect to the Shares subject to the award. Dividend equivalent rights will be paid at such time as is determined by the Committee in its discretion (including without limitation at the times paid to stockholders generally or at the times of vesting or payment of the RSU or PSU. Dividend equivalent rights will be subject to forfeiture under the same conditions as apply to the underlying RSUs or PSUs. All RSUs and PSUs are generally nontransferable. 
Cash Performance Awards 
A performance award is denominated in a cash amount (rather than in Shares) and is payable based on the attainment of pre-established business and/or individual performance goals. The requirements for payment may be also based upon the continued service of the participant during the performance period, and vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances, as determined by the Committee. All cash performance awards are generally nontransferable. The maximum amount of cash compensation that may be paid to a participant during any one calendar year under all cash performance awards and all other awards that are actually paid or settled in cash is limited to $2.0 million. 
Effect of Change in Control 
Upon the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the plan as a "change of control event" under Section 409A of the Code, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable law, or unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of outstanding awards, including without limitation the following (or any combination thereof): (i) continuation or assumption of our outstanding awards (if we are the surviving company or corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same or comparable terms (including, with respect to economic value) for outstanding awards; (iii) accelerated exercisability, vesting and/or payment; and (iv) if all or substantially all of our outstanding Shares transferred in exchange for cash consideration in connection with that change in control: (A) upon written notice, provide that any outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights are exercisable during a reasonable period of time immediately prior to the scheduled consummation of the event or any other reasonable period as determined by the Committee (contingent upon the consummation of the event), and at the end of that period, those stock options and stock appreciation rights will terminate to the extent not so exercised within the relevant period; and (B) cancellation of all or any portion of outstanding awards for fair value, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. 
Forfeiture 
The Committee may specify in an award agreement that an award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including termination of service for "cause" (as defined in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan), violation of material Company policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the participant, or other conduct by the participant that is detrimental to our business or reputation. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an award agreement, if (i) a participant's service is terminated for "cause" or (ii) after termination   of service for any other reason, the Committee determines in its discretion either that, (A) during the participant's period of service, the participant engaged in an act which would have warranted termination from service for "cause" or (B) after termination, the participant engaged in conduct that violates any continuing obligation or duty of the participant set forth in any executive or restrictive covenant agreement to which the participant is a party in favor of us or any of our subsidiaries, that participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to that award may be subject to cancellation, forfeiture and/or recoupment. 
Right of Recapture; Parachute Payments 
If a participant receives compensation pursuant to an award calculated by reference to financial statements that are subsequently required to be restated in a way that would decrease the value of that compensation, the participant will, upon our written request, forfeit and repay to us the difference between what the participant received and what the participant should have received based on the accounting restatement, in accordance with (i) our compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy, as may be in effect from time to time and (ii) any compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy made applicable by law including the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, in the event the receipt of all payments or distributions by us in the nature of compensation to or for a participant's benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this plan or otherwise (a "Payment"), would subject the participant to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Payments will be reduced to the greatest amount of the Payments that can be paid and would not result in the imposition of the excise tax (the "Reduced Amount"), however, if the portion of the Payments the participant would receive after payment of all applicable taxes, including any excise taxes, is greater than the Reduced Amount, no such reduction will occur. 
Tax Withholding 
We have the power and the right to deduct or withhold automatically from any amount deliverable under an award or otherwise, or require a participant to remit to us, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. With respect to required withholding, participants may elect (subject to our automatic withholding right set out above) to satisfy the withholding requirement with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, in whole or in part, by the methods described in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan applicable to the payment of the exercise price in connection with stock option exercises. 
Starting in 2019, we are requiring certain senior executives to cover tax liabilities resulting from the vesting of their equity awards pursuant to sell-to-cover transactions under 10b5-1 plans to, among other things, conserve cash that the Company must remit to tax authorities that it would otherwise fund from cash on hand. 
Deferrals of Payment 
The Committee may in its discretion permit participants in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to defer the receipt of payment of cash or delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due by virtue of the exercise of a right or the satisfaction of vesting or other conditions with respect to an award or an election to receive Shares (in lieu of compensation otherwise payable in cash) on a deferred basis in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan; provided, however, that discretion will not apply in the case of a stock option or stock appreciation right. 
Trading Policy Considerations 
Stock option exercises and other awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is subject to our insider trading policy, Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines (as described above) and other trading or ownership policy related restrictions, terms and conditions as in effect, from time to time.  Term, Amendment and Termination 
The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended by the amendment described in this proxy statement, will be effective as of the date on which stockholders approve it. The Board may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan at any time. However, no termination or amendment of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will adversely affect any award granted beforehand without the consent of the participant or the permitted transferee of the award; except as otherwise provided in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan or determined by the Committee to be necessary to comply with applicable laws. The Board may seek the approval of any amendment by our stockholders to the extent it deems necessary or advisable for purposes of compliance with Section 162(m) or Section 422 of the Code, the listing requirements of NASDAQ or for any other purpose. 
Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences associated with certain awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The summary is based on the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement, and is, therefore, subject to future changes in the law, possibly with retroactive effect. The summary is general in nature and does not purport to be legal or tax advice. Further, the summary does not purport to cover federal employment tax or other U.S. federal tax consequences that may be associated with the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, nor does it cover state, local or non-U.S. taxes, except as may be specifically noted. 
Stock Options (other than incentive stock options). In general, a participant has no taxable income upon the grant of a non-qualifying stock option (an "NQSO") but realizes income in connection with the exercise of the NQSO in an amount equal to the excess (at the time of exercise) of the fair market value of the exercised shares over the exercise price. A corresponding deduction is generally available to the Company. Upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the shares, any recognized gain or loss is treated as a capital gain or loss for which the Company is not entitled to a deduction. 
Incentive Stock Options. In general, a participant realizes no taxable income upon the grant or exercise of incentive stock options (an "ISO"). However, the exercise of an ISO may result in an alternative minimum tax liability to the participant. Generally, a disposition of shares purchased pursuant to an ISO within two years from the date of grant or within one year after exercise produces ordinary income to the participant (and generally a deduction to the Company) equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise less the exercise price. Any additional gain recognized in the disposition is treated as a capital gain for which the Company is not entitled to a deduction. If the participant does not dispose of the shares until after the expiration of these one- and two-year holding periods, any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale of shares purchased pursuant to an ISO is treated as a long-term capital gain or loss for which the Company is not entitled to a deduction. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. The grant of a stock appreciation right (a "SAR") does not itself result in taxable income, nor does taxable income result merely because a SAR becomes exercisable. In general, a participant who exercises a SAR for shares of stock or receives payment in cancellation of a SAR will have ordinary income equal to the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any stock received. A corresponding deduction is generally available to the Company. 
RSAs. A participant who is awarded or purchases shares subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture generally does not have income until the risk of forfeiture lapses. When the risk of forfeiture lapses, the participant has ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at that time over the purchase price, if any, and a corresponding deduction is generally available to the Company. However, a participant may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed on restricted stock when it is acquired rather than later, when the substantial risk of forfeiture lapses. A participant who makes an effective 83(b) election will realize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares as of the time of acquisition less any price paid for the shares. A corresponding deduction will generally be available to the Company. If a participant makes an effective 83(b) election, no additional income results by reason of the lapsing of the restrictions.  For purposes of determining capital gain or loss on a sale of shares awarded under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, the holding period in the shares begins when the participant recognizes taxable income with respect to the transfer. The participant's tax basis in the shares equals the amount paid for the shares plus any income realized with respect to the transfer. However, if a participant makes an effective 83(b) election and later forfeits the shares, the tax loss realized as a result of the forfeiture is limited to the excess of what the participant paid for the shares (if anything) over the amount (if any) realized in connection with the forfeiture. 
RSUs. The grant of a restricted stock unit does not itself generally result in taxable income. Instead, the participant is generally taxed upon vesting and settlement (and a corresponding deduction is generally available to the Company), unless he or she has made a proper election to defer receipt of the shares (or cash if the award is cash settled) under Section 409A of the Code. If the shares delivered are restricted for tax purposes, the participant will instead be subject to the rules described above for restricted stock. 
Section 162(m). Compensation resulting from awards made under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and certain other current and former executive officers, to the extent such individual's aggregate compensation from the Company exceeds $1 million in a given year, generally will be non-deductible to the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code. While our Compensation Committee intend to consider the potential impact of Section 162(m) on awards granted under the plan, we will retain discretionary authority to provide compensation that is not deductible in whole or in part under Section 162(m). 
Certain Change in Control Payments. Under Section 280G of the Code, the vesting or accelerated exercisability of options or the vesting and payments of other awards in connection with a change in control of a corporation may be required to be valued and taken into account in determining whether participants have received compensatory payments, contingent on the change in control, in excess of certain limits. If these limits are exceeded, a substantial portion of amounts payable to the participant, including income recognized by reason of the grant, vesting or exercise of awards may be subject to an additional 20% federal tax and may be non-deductible to the Company. However, as described above, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan provides any Payment would be reduced so that no portion of the Payment is non-deductible under Section 280G of the Code unless, after payment of all applicable taxes, including any excise taxes, the amount the participant would receive is greater than the Reduced Amount. 
Plan Benefits 
Grants under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as proposed to be amended, will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Because we cannot presently determine the number of Shares underlying, or the timing, types, exercise/base prices or vesting and other provisions of, grants to be made to participants under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as proposed to be amended, it is not possible to determine the value of benefits that may be obtained by directors, executive officers and other employees under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. 
Vote Required and Board of Directors' Recommendation 
Approval of the amendment to the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of Shares reserved for issuance under that plan by 825,000 Shares requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Shares present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as shares voting on that matter and accordingly will have no effect on the approval of this Proposal 2. 
Board of Directors' Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT 
YOU VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE 2015 EQUITY  INCENTIVE PLAN 
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER BY 825,000 SHARES.  PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although stockholder ratification of the appointment of Deloitte is not required by law, we are submitting the appointment to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. 
Representatives of Deloitte are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Vote Required 
The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte, then the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. Even if stockholders ratify the appointment of Deloitte, the Audit Committee retains the discretion to appoint a different independent auditor at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Board of Directors' Recommendation 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT 
YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF DELOITTE AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.

The Committee shall have all powers and discretion necessary or appropriate to administer the Plan and to control its operation, including, but not limited to, the power to (i) determine the Eligible Persons to whom Awards shall be granted under the Plan and to grant Awards, (ii) prescribe the restrictions, terms and conditions of all Awards, (iii) interpret the Plan and terms of the Awards, (iv) adopt rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith, and interpret, amend or revoke any such rules, (v) make all determinations with respect to a Participant's Service and the termination of such Service for purposes of any Award, (vi) subject the provisions of Section 6 hereof, to extend at any time the period in which Stock Options may be exercised, (vii) to determine at any time whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances distribution or the receipt of Stock and other amounts payable with respect to an Award shall be deferred either automatically or at the election of the receiving Participant and whether and to what extent the 
Page A-5 
Company shall pay or credit amounts constituting interest (at rates determined by the Committee) or dividends or deemed dividends on such deferrals, (viii) correct any defect(s) or omission(s) or reconcile any ambiguity(ies) or inconsistency(ies) in the Plan or any Award thereunder, (ix) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan, to decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan, and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan, (x) to suspend the right to exercise or net exercise any Award during any blackout period that is necessary or desirable to comply with the requirements of applicable securities laws, and to extend the period for exercise of such Award by an equal period of time, (xi) subject to the terms of the Plan, amend the terms of an Award in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan, and (xii) adopt such procedures and subplans and Award Agreements as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the Plan by Eligible Person who are foreign nationals or employed outside of the United States or as otherwise are necessary or appropriate for the administration and application of the Plan. The Committee's determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by the Committee selectively among Participants and Eligible Persons, whether or not such persons are similarly situated. The Committee shall, in its discretion, consider such factors as it deems relevant in making its interpretations, determinations and actions under the Plan including, without limitation, the recommendations or advice of any officer or employee of the Company or such attorneys, consultants, accountants or other advisors as it may select. All interpretations, determinations, and actions by the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties. 
3.3 Delegation of Authority. The Committee shall have the right, from time to time, to delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority of the Committee to grant and determine the terms and conditions of Awards granted under the Plan, subject to the requirements of Section 157(c) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (or any successor provision) and such other limitations as the Committee shall determine. In no event shall any such delegation of authority be permitted with respect to Awards granted to any member of the Board or to any Eligible Person who is subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or is a "covered employee" under Section 162(m) of the Code (as determined in accordance with applicable guidance as of the applicable date of determination). The Committee shall also be permitted to delegate, to any appropriate officer or employee of the Company, responsibility for performing certain ministerial functions under the Plan. In the event that the Committee's authority is delegated to officers or employees in accordance with the foregoing, all provisions of the Plan relating to the Committee shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the foregoing by treating any such reference as a reference to such officer or employee for such purpose. Any action undertaken in accordance with the Committee's delegation of authority hereunder shall have the same force and effect as if such action was undertaken directly by the Committee and shall be deemed for all purposes of the Plan to have been taken by the Committee. 
4. Shares Subject to the Plan. 
4.1 Number of Shares Reserved. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5 hereof and subject to Section 15.10 hereof, the total number of shares of Common Stock that are reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be 2,415,277 (the "Share Reserve"); provided, that no more than twenty percent of the Share Reserve may be granted as Incentive Stock Options, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5 hereof and the provisions of Sections 422 or 424 of the Code and any successor provisions; provided, further, that nothing in this Plan requires any percentage of Awards (or Shares underlying Awards) to be granted as Incentive Stock Options. Each share of Common Stock subject to an Award shall reduce the Share Reserve by one share; provided, that Awards that are required to be paid in cash pursuant to their terms shall not reduce the Share Reserve. Any shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall consist of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. 
4.2 Share Replenishment. To the extent that an Award granted under this Plan is canceled, expired, forfeited, surrendered, settled by delivery of fewer shares than the number underlying the Award, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of the shares to the Participant, the shares of Common Stock retained by or returned to the Company will (i) not be deemed to have been delivered under the Plan, (ii) be available for future Awards under the Plan, and (iii) increase the Share Reserve by one share for each share that is retained by or returned to the Company; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, shares that are (x) withheld from an 
Page A-6 
Award or separately surrendered by the Participant in payment of the exercise or purchase price or taxes relating to such an Award or (y) not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right, shall be deemed to constitute delivered shares, shall count against the Share Reserve and not be available for future Awards under the Plan and shall continue to be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining whether any of the Award limits specified in Sections 4.3 or 4.4 have been attained. 
4.3 Awards Granted to Eligible Persons Other Than Non-Employee Directors. For purposes of complying with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject to (i) Stock Options, (ii) Stock Appreciation Rights, (iii) Restricted Stock Awards that vest in full or in part based on the attainment of Performance Goals, and (iv) Restricted Stock Units that vest in full or in part based on the attainment of Performance Goals that are granted to any Eligible Person other than a Non-Employee Director during any calendar year shall be limited to 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock for each such Award type individually (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5 hereof). If an Award is settled in cash, the number of shares of Common Stock on which the Award is based shall not count toward the individual share limit set forth in this Section 4.3, but shall count against the annual Cash Performance Award limit set forth in Section 10.7. 
4.4 Awards Granted to Non-Employee Directors.

If an Award is settled in cash, the number of shares of Common Stock on which the Award is based shall not count toward the individual share limit set forth in this Section 4.4, but shall count against the annual Cash Performance Award limit set forth in Section 10.7. 
4.5 Adjustments. If there shall occur any change with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other distribution with respect to the shares of Common Stock or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, spin-off, stock purchase or other similar corporate change or any other change affecting the Common Stock (other than regular cash dividends to shareholders of the Company), the Committee shall, in the manner and to the extent it considers equitable to the Participants and consistent with the terms of the Plan, cause an adjustment to be made to (i) the maximum number and kind of shares of Common Stock provided in Sections 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 hereof (including the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may become payable to a Participant provided in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 hereof), (ii) the number and kind of shares of Common Stock, units or other rights subject to then outstanding Awards, (iii) the exercise or base price for each share or unit or other right subject to then outstanding Awards, (iv) the maximum amount that may become payable to a Participant under Cash Performance Awards provided in Section 10.7 hereof, (v) issue additional Awards or shares of Common Stock, issue dividend equivalent rights or make cash payments to the holders of outstanding Awards, in each case, on such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee, and/or (vi) any other terms of an Award that are affected by the event; provided, that with respect to any Awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, no adjustment shall be made to the Performance Goals or the manner in which performance will be measured against the Performance Goals, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.6 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any such adjustments shall, to the extent necessary, be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, (b) in the case of Incentive Stock Options, any such adjustments shall, to the extent practicable, be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. 
5. Eligibility and Awards. 
5.1 Designation of Participants. Any Eligible Person may be selected by the Committee to receive an Award and become a Participant under the Plan. The Committee has the authority, in its discretion, to determine and designate from time to time those Eligible Persons who are to be granted Awards, the types of Awards to be 
Page A-7 
granted, the number of shares of Common Stock or units subject to Awards to be granted, the terms and conditions of such Awards consistent with the terms of the Plan, and to grant any such Awards. In selecting Eligible Persons to be Participants and in determining the type and amount of Awards to be granted under the Plan, the Committee shall consider any and all factors that it deems relevant or appropriate. Designation of a Participant in any year shall not require the Committee to designate such person to receive an Award in any other year or, once designated, to receive the same type or amount of Award as granted to the Participant in any other year. 
5.2 Determination of Awards. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of all Awards granted to Participants in accordance with its authority under Section 3.2 hereof. An Award may consist of one type of right or benefit hereunder or of two or more such rights or benefits granted in tandem. 
5.3 Award Agreements. Each Award granted to an Eligible Person under the Plan will be represented in an Award Agreement. The terms of all Awards under the Plan, as determined by the Committee, will be set forth in each individual Award Agreements as described in Section 15.2 hereof. 
5.4 Corporate Action Constituting Grant of Awards. Corporate action constituting a grant by the Company of an Award to any Participant will be deemed completed as of the date of such corporate action, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in the resolutions comprising such corporate action, regardless of when the instrument, certificate or letter evidencing the Award is communicated to, or actually received or accepted by, the Participant. In the event that the corporate records (e.g., Committee consents, resolutions or minutes) documenting the corporate action constituting the Award grant contain terms (e.g., exercise price, vesting schedule or number of shares) that are inconsistent with those in the Award Agreement or related grant documents as a result of a clerical error in the papering of the Award Agreement or related grant documents, the corporate records will control and the Participant will have no legally binding right to the incorrect term in the Award Agreement or related grant documents. 
6. Stock Options. 
6.1 Grant of Stock Options. A Stock Option may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee, except that an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to an Eligible Person satisfying the conditions of Section 6.7(a) hereof. Each Stock Option shall be designated on the Date of Grant, in the discretion of the Committee, as an Incentive Stock Option or as a Nonqualified Stock Option. 
6.2 Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of a Stock Option shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Date of Grant. The Committee may in its discretion specify an exercise price per share that is higher than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Date of Grant. 
6.3 Vesting of Stock Options. The Committee shall, in its discretion, prescribe the time or times at which or the conditions upon which, a Stock Option or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Option may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or a Subsidiary for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified Performance Goal(s) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion, all as set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Option, including, without limitation, upon a Change in Control or upon termination of Service under certain circumstances, in each case, as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Committee's subsequent resolutions. If the vesting requirements of a Stock Option are not satisfied, the Award shall be forfeited as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
6.4 Term of Stock Options. The Committee shall in its discretion prescribe in an Award Agreement the period during which a vested Stock Option may be exercised; provided, however, that the maximum term of a 
Page A-8 
Stock Option shall be ten (10) years from the Date of Grant. The Committee may provide that a Stock Option will cease to be exercisable upon or at the end of a specified time period following a termination of Service for any reason as set forth in the Award Agreement or otherwise. 
6.5 Stock Option Exercise; Tax Withholding. Subject to such terms and conditions as specified in an Award Agreement, a Stock Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the term thereof by notice in the form required by the Company, together with payment of the aggregate exercise price and applicable withholding tax. Payment of the exercise price shall be made: (i) in cash or by cash equivalent acceptable to the Committee, or, (ii) to the extent permitted by the Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the Award Agreement, (A) in shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date of exercise, (B) through an open-market, broker-assisted sales transaction pursuant to which the Company is promptly delivered the amount of proceeds necessary to satisfy the exercise price, (C) by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Stock Option by the number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price, (D) by a combination of the methods described above or (E) by such other method as may be approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. In addition to and at the time of payment of the exercise price, the Participant shall pay to the Company the full amount of any and all applicable income tax, employment tax and other amounts required to be withheld in connection with such exercise, payable by such of the methods described above for the payment of the exercise price as may be approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. 
6.6 Limited Transferability of Nonqualified Stock Options. All Nonqualified Stock Options shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. The Nonqualified Stock Options and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferable, except as otherwise provided in Section 15.3 hereof. 
6.7 Additional Rules for Incentive Stock Options. 
(a) Eligibility. An Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to an Eligible Person who is considered an employee for purposes of Treasury Regulation §1.421-1(h) with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary that qualifies as a "subsidiary corporation" with respect to the Company for purposes of Section 424(f) of the Code. 
(b) Annual Limits. No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to a Participant as a result of which the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Date of Grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code are exercisable for the first time in any calendar year under the Plan and any other stock option plans of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation, would exceed $100,000, determined in accordance with Section 422(d) of the Code. This limitation shall be applied by taking such incentive stock options into account in the order in which they were granted. 
(c) Additional Limitations. In the case of any Incentive Stock Option granted to an Eligible Person who owns, either directly or indirectly (taking into account the attribution rules contained in Section 424(d) of the Code), stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, the exercise price shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Date of Grant and the maximum term shall be five (5) years. 
(d) Termination of Employment. An Award of an Incentive Stock Option shall provide that such Stock Option may be exercised not later than (i) three (3) months following termination of employment of the Participant with the Company and all Subsidiaries (other than as set forth in clause (ii) of this Section 6.7(d)) or (ii) one year following termination of employment of the Participant with the Company and all Subsidiaries due to death or permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, in each case as and to the extent determined by the Committee to comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. 
Page A-9 
(e) Other Terms and Conditions; Nontransferability. No Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan may be granted more than ten (10) years following the date that the Plan is adopted or the date the Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders, whichever is earlier. The Award Agreement representing any Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as are deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee, which terms, together with the terms of the Plan, shall be intended and interpreted to cause such Incentive Stock Option to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. A Stock Option that is granted as an Incentive Stock Option shall, to the extent it fails to qualify as an "incentive stock option" under the Code, be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. An Incentive Stock Option shall by its terms be nontransferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of a Participant only by such Participant. 
(f) Disqualifying Dispositions. If shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of within two years following the Date of Grant or one year following the transfer of such shares to the Participant upon exercise, the Participant shall, promptly following such disposition, notify the Company in writing of the date and terms of such disposition and provide such other information regarding the disposition as the Company may reasonably require. 
6.8 Repricing Prohibited. Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.5 hereof and the provisions of Section 12 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board shall (a) cancel a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan in exchange for cash or another Award when the exercise price per share under such Stock Option then exceeds the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, (b) cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan that would have the effect of reducing the exercise price of such Stock Option or (c) otherwise approve any modification to a Stock Option previously granted under the Plan that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by The NASDAQ Global Market or other principal exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed. 
7. Stock Appreciation Rights. 
7.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted on a basis that allows for the exercise of the right by the Participant or that provides for the automatic payment of the right upon a specified date or event, in either case, as set forth in the Award Agreement representing such Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock Appreciation Rights and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferable, except as provided in Section 15.3 hereof. 
7.2 Stand-Alone Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted without any related Stock Option. The Committee shall in its discretion provide in an Award Agreement the time or times at which or the conditions upon which, a Stock Appreciation Right or portion thereof shall become vested and/or exercisable. The requirements for vesting and exercisability of a Stock Appreciation Right may be based on the continued Service of a Participant with the Company or a Subsidiary for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified Performance Goal(s) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion, all as set forth in the Award Agreement. If the vesting requirements of a Stock Appreciation Right are not satisfied, the Award shall be forfeited as set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any Stock Appreciation Right, including, without limitation, upon a Change in Control or upon termination of Service under certain circumstances, in each case, as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Committee's subsequent resolutions. A Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable or payable at such time or times as determined by the Committee as set forth in the Award Agreement; provided, that the maximum term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be ten (10) years from the Date of Grant. The Committee may provide that a Stock Appreciation Right will cease to be exercisable upon or at the end of a period following a termination of Service for any reason as set forth in the Award Agreement. The 
Page A-10 
base price of a Stock Appreciation Right granted without any related Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion; provided, however, that the base price per share of any such stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Date of Grant. 
7.3 Tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted in tandem with a Stock Option and constitute a single Award. A tandem Stock Option/Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder to elect, as to all or any portion of the number of shares subject to the Award, to exercise either the Stock Option or the Stock Appreciation Right, resulting in the reduction of the corresponding number of shares subject to the Award, including the tandem the Stock Appreciation Right or Stock Option, as a applicable, not so exercised. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option hereunder shall have a base price per share equal to the per share exercise price of the Stock Option, will be vested and exercisable at the same time or times that a related Stock Option is vested and exercisable, and will expire no later than the time at which the related Stock Option expires, in each case, as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
7.4 Payment of Stock Appreciation Rights. A Stock Appreciation Right will entitle the holder, upon exercise or other payment of the Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, to receive an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise or payment of the Stock Appreciation Right over the base price of such Stock Appreciation Right, by (ii) the number of shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Right is exercised or paid. Payment of the amount determined under the foregoing may be made, as approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, in shares of Common Stock valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or payment, in cash or in a combination of shares of Common Stock and cash, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements. 
7.5 Repricing Prohibited. Subject to the anti-dilution adjustment provisions contained in Section 4.5 hereof and the provisions of Section 12 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, neither the Committee nor the Board shall (a) cancel a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan in exchange for cash or another Award when the base price per share then exceeds the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, (b) cause the cancellation, substitution or amendment of a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan that would have the effect of reducing the base price of such Stock Appreciation Right or (c) otherwise approve any modification to a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the Plan that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by The NASDAQ Global Market or other principal exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed. 
8. Restricted Stock Awards. 
8.1 Grant of Restricted Stock Awards. A Restricted Stock Award may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. The Committee may require the payment by the Participant of a specified purchase price in connection with the issuance of any Restricted Stock Award as set forth in the Award Agreement representing such Restricted Stock Award, which may also include the manner in which payment of any specified purchase price may be made as prescribed by the Committee. 
8.2 Vesting Requirements. The restrictions imposed on shares granted under a Restricted Stock Award shall lapse in accordance with the vesting requirements specified by the Committee in the Award Agreement. The requirements for vesting of a Restricted Stock Award may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or a Subsidiary for a specified time period (or periods), on the attainment of a specified Performance Goal(s) designed to meet the requirements for exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee may accelerate the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award, including, without limitation, upon a Change in Control or upon termination of Service under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Committee's 
Page A-11 
subsequent resolutions, subject to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code (to the extent applicable). If the vesting requirements of a Restricted Stock Award shall not be satisfied or, if applicable, the Performance Goal(s) with respect to such Restricted Stock Award are not attained, the Award shall be forfeited and the shares of Stock subject to the Award shall be returned to the Company, as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
8.3 Transfer Restrictions. Shares granted under any Restricted Stock Award and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferable until all applicable restrictions are removed or have expired, except as provided in Section 15.3 hereof. Failure to satisfy any applicable restrictions shall result in the subject shares of the Restricted Stock Award being forfeited and returned to the Company. The Committee may require in an Award Agreement that certificates (if any) representing the shares granted under a Restricted Stock Award bear a legend making appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed, and that certificates (if any) representing the shares granted or sold under a Restricted Stock Award will remain in the physical custody of an escrow holder (which may be the Company or an officer of the Company) until all restrictions are removed or have expired. 
8.4 Rights as Stockholder. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, the provisions of Section 15.6 hereof, and to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, the Participant shall not have any rights of a stockholder with respect any of the shares granted to the Participant under a Restricted Stock Award (including, the right to vote or receive dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto) unless and until such shares vest. 
8.5 Section 83(b) Election. If a Participant makes an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to a Restricted Stock Award, the Participant shall file, within thirty (30) days following the Date of Grant, a copy of such election with the Company and with the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with the regulations under Section 83 of the Code. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that the Restricted Stock Award is conditioned upon the Participant's making or refraining from making an election with respect to the Award under Section 83(b) of the Code 
8.6 Other. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 8 or any other section of the Plan, with respect to any Restricted Stock Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, unless the Board determines that an applicable exemption under applicable law applies, all references to the Committee shall solely mean each member of the Committee that satisfies the requirements for an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
9. Restricted Stock Units. 
9.1 Grant of Restricted Stock Units. A Restricted Stock Unit may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. The value of each Restricted Stock Unit shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the applicable date or time period of determination, as specified by the Committee. Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee shall determine and as set forth in the Award Agreement representing such Restricted Stock Units. Restricted Stock Units and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferable, except as provided in Section 15.3 hereof. 
9.2 Vesting of Restricted Stock Units. On the Date of Grant, the Committee shall, in its discretion, determine any vesting requirements with respect to Restricted Stock Units, which shall be set forth in the Award Agreement. The requirements for vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit may be based on the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or a Subsidiary for a specified time period (or periods) or on such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion. In addition, a Restricted Stock Unit may be denominated as a Performance Stock Unit. The requirements for vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit denominated as a Performance Stock Unit may be based, in whole or in part, on the attainment of pre-established business and/ or individual Performance Goal(s) over a specified performance period designed to meet the requirements for exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code, or otherwise, as approved by the Committee in its discretion and as set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee may accelerate the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit, including, without limitation, upon a Change in Control or upon termination of Service under certain 
Page A-12 
 circumstances, as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Committee's subsequent resolutions, subject to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code (to the extent applicable). If the vesting requirements of a Restricted Stock Units Award are not satisfied or, if applicable, the Performance Goal(s) with respect to such Restricted Stock Units Award are not attained, the Award shall be forfeited, as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
9.3 Payment of Restricted Stock Units. Restricted Stock Units shall become payable to a Participant at the time or times determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, which may be upon or following the vesting of the Award. Payment of a Restricted Stock Unit may be made, as approved by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement, in cash or in shares of Common Stock or in a combination thereof, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements. Any cash payment of a Restricted Stock Unit shall be made based upon the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, determined on such date or over such time period as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement. 
9.4 Dividend Equivalent Rights. Restricted Stock Units may be granted together with a dividend equivalent right with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, which dividend equivalent right may be accumulated and may be deemed reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units or may be accumulated in cash, as determined by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in an Award Agreement. Dividend equivalent rights will be paid at such time as determined by the Committee in its discretion (including without limitation at the times paid to stockholders generally or at the times of vesting or payment of the Restricted Stock Unit) as set forth in an Award Agreement. Dividend equivalent rights may be subject to forfeiture under the same conditions as apply to the underlying Restricted Stock Units, as set forth in an Award Agreement. 
9.5 Other. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9 or any other section of the Plan, with respect to any Restricted Stock Units intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, unless the Board determines that an applicable exemption under applicable law applies, all references to the Committee shall solely mean each member of the Committee that satisfies the requirements for an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Code 
10. Performance Awards and Performance Criteria. 
10.1 Grant of Cash Performance Awards. A Cash Performance Award may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. Payment amounts shall be based on the attainment of specified levels of attainment with respect to the Performance Goals, including, if applicable, specified threshold, target and maximum performance levels or such other terms and conditions as approved by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in an Award Agreement. The requirements for payment may be also based upon the continued Service of the Participant with the Company or any Subsidiary during the respective performance period and on such other conditions as determined by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement. Cash Performance Awards and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferable, except as provided in Section 15.3 hereof. 
10.2 Establishment of Performance-Based Terms. With respect to Cash Performance Awards and other Awards intended to qualify as "performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code (collectively, "Performance Awards"), before the 90th day of the applicable performance period (or, if the performance period is less than one year, no later than the number of days which is equal to 25% of such performance period), the Committee will determine the duration of the performance period, the Performance Criteria, the applicable Performance Goals relating to the Performance Criteria and the amount and terms of payment/vesting upon achievement of the Performance Goals. 
10.3 Award Agreements. Each Cash Performance Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the performance period and such other terms and conditions as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine. The Committee may accelerate the vesting of a Cash Performance Award, including, without 
Page A-13 
limitation, upon a Change in Control or termination of Service under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Award Agreement or the Committee's subsequent resolutions, subject to compliance with Section 162(m) of the Code (to the extent applicable). 
10.4 Performance Criteria.

Each of the Performance Criteria shall be applied and interpreted in accordance with an objective formula or standard established by the Committee at the time the applicable Award is granted including, without limitation, GAAP. 
10.5 Performance Goals. For purposes of Performance Awards, the "Performance Goals" shall be the levels of achievement relating to the Performance Criteria selected by the Committee for the Award. The Performance Goals shall be written and shall be expressed as an objective formula or standard that precludes discretion to increase the amount of compensation payable that would otherwise be due upon attainment of the goal. The Performance Goals may be applied on an absolute basis or relative to an identified index, peer group, or one or more competitors or other companies (including particular business segments or divisions or such companies), as specified by the Committee. The Performance Goals need not be the same for all Participants. 
10.6 Adjustments. At the time that an Award is granted, the Committee may provide for the Performance Goals or the manner in which performance will be measured against the Performance Goals to be adjusted in such objective manner as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, adjustments to reflect non-cash losses or charges, charges for restructurings, non-operating income, the impact of corporate transactions, discontinued operations or financing transactions, severance and recruitment costs, "run rate" savings, costs incurred in establishing new manufacturing sources, specified legal expenses, extraordinary and other unusual or non-recurring items or events and the cumulative effects of accounting or tax law changes. In addition, with respect to a Participant hired or promoted following the beginning of a performance period, the Committee may determine to prorate the Performance Goals and/or the amount of any payment in respect of such Participant's Performance Awards for the partial performance period. 
10.7 Maximum Amount of Cash Performance Awards. The maximum amount that may become payable to any one Participant during any one calendar year under all Cash Performance Awards and all other Awards that are actually paid or settled in cash is limited to $2,000,000. 
10.8 Negative Discretion. Notwithstanding anything else contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall, to the extent provided in an Award Agreement, have the right, in its discretion, (i) to reduce or eliminate the amount otherwise payable to any Participant under an Award and (ii) to establish rules or procedures that have the effect of limiting the amount payable to any Participant to an amount that is less than the amount that is otherwise payable under an Award. The Committee may exercise the discretion provided for by the foregoing sentence in a non-uniform manner among Participants. The Committee shall not have discretion to increase the amount that is otherwise payable to any Participant under a Performance Award. 
Page A-14 
10.9 Certification. Following the conclusion of the performance period of a Performance Award, the Committee shall certify in writing whether the Performance Goals for that performance period have been achieved, or certify the degree of achievement, if applicable. 
10.10 Payment. Upon certification of the Performance Goals for a Performance Award, the Committee shall determine the level of vesting or amount of payment to the Participant pursuant to the Award, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, Performance Awards may be paid, at the discretion of the Committee, in any combination of cash or shares of Common Stock, based upon the Fair Market Value of such shares at the time of payment 
10.11 Other. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10 or any other section of the Plan, with respect to any Performance Award, unless the Board determines that an applicable exemption under applicable law applies, all references to the Committee shall solely mean each member of the Committee that satisfies the requirements for an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
11. Stock Awards. 
11.1 Grant of Stock Awards. A Stock Award may be granted to any Eligible Person selected by the Committee. A Stock Award may be granted for past, or in anticipation of future, Services, in lieu of any discretionary bonus or other discretionary cash compensation, as directors' compensation or for any other valid purpose as determined by the Committee. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, and such Awards shall be made without vesting requirements. In addition, the Committee may, in connection with any Stock Award, require the payment of a specified purchase price, which may also include the manner in which payment of any specified purchase price may be made as prescribed by the Committee. 
11.2 Rights as Stockholder. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 11 and the applicable Award Agreement, upon the issuance of the Common Stock under a Stock Award, the Participant shall have all rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock, including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto. 
11.3 Elections to Receive Stock in Lieu of Compensation. Subject to Section 409A of the Code and, if applicable, Section 15.4 hereof, upon the request of a Participant and with the consent of the Committee, each such Participant may, pursuant to an advance written election delivered to the Company no later than the date specified by the Committee, receive a portion of the cash compensation otherwise due to such Participant in the form of shares of Common Stock either currently or on a deferred basis in accordance with Section 15.4 hereof. 
11.4 Restrictions on Transfers. The right to receive shares of Common Stock on a deferred basis and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall be non-transferrable, except as provided in Section 15.3 hereof. 
12. Change in Control. 
12.1 Effect on Awards. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable law or unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the Committee is authorized (but not obligated) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of outstanding Awards, including without limitation any of the following (or any combination thereof): 
(a) continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the Plan by the Company (if it is the surviving company or corporation) or by the surviving company or corporation or its parent; 
(b) substitution by the surviving company or corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same or comparable terms (including, with respect to economic value) for outstanding Awards (with appropriate adjustments to the type of consideration payable upon settlement of the Awards); 
Page A-15 
(c) accelerated exercisability, vesting and/or payment under outstanding Awards immediately prior to or upon the occurrence of such event or upon a termination of employment following such event; and 
(d) if all or substantially all of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock are transferred in exchange for cash consideration in connection with such Change in Control: 
(i) upon written notice, provide that any outstanding Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights are exercisable during a reasonable period of time immediately prior to the scheduled consummation of the event or such other reasonable period as determined by the Committee (contingent upon the consummation of the event) and, at the end of such period, such Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate to the extent not so exercised within the relevant period; and 
(ii) cancellation of all or any portion of outstanding Awards for fair value (in the form of cash, shares, other property or any combination thereof) as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee; provided, that in the case of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the fair value may equal the excess, if any, of the value of the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to holders of the same number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Awards (or, if no such consideration is paid, Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such outstanding Awards or portion thereof being canceled) over the aggregate exercise or base price, as applicable, with respect to such Awards or portion thereof being canceled, or, if there is no such excess, zero. 
12.2 Definition of Change in Control. Unless otherwise defined in an Award Agreement, "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of one of the following events: 
(a) Any Person becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power, excluding any Person who Beneficially Owns fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power on the Effective Date of the Plan, of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of its directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"), including by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise; provided, however, that for purposes of this definition, the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change in Control: (i) any acquisition of Outstanding Company Voting Securities directly from the Company, including without limitation, a public offering of securities, or (ii) any acquisition of Outstanding Company Voting Securities by (x) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including an acquisition by any employee benefit plan or related trust sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y)(i) one or more Avista Entities or a "group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) in which an Avista Entity is a member and, (ii) after such acquisition, one or more Avista Entities holds more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or such acquiring Person. 
(b) Consummation of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation to which the Company is a party or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (a "Business Combination"), unless, following such Business Combination: (i) any Persons who were the Beneficial Owners of Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination are the Beneficial Owners, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or election of members of a comparable governing body) of the entity resulting from the Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity which, as a result of such transaction, owns all or substantially all of the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets, either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) (the "Successor Entity") in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination; or (ii) no Person (excluding any Successor Entity or any employee benefit plan or related trust of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, such Successor Entity or any of its subsidiaries) is the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (or comparable governing body) of the Successor Entity, except to the extent that such ownership of the Company existed prior to the Business Combination. 
Page A-16 
(c) Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code with respect to the payment of "nonqualified deferred compensation," "Change of Control" shall be defined as, and limited to, a "change in control event" as defined under Section 409A of the Code. 
13. Forfeiture Events. 
13.1 General. The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement at the time of the Award that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of Service for Cause, violation of material Company policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no shares of Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to Section 11.3 hereof shall be subject to this Section 13 hereof, other than Section 13.3 hereof or the terms or as otherwise may be required pursuant to the terms and conditions of such cash compensation otherwise due to the Participant. 
13.2 Termination for Cause. 
(a) Treatment of Awards. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in an Award Agreement, if (i) a Participant's Service with the Company or any Subsidiary shall be terminated for Cause, or (ii) after termination of Service for any other reason, the Committee determines in its discretion either that, (1) during the Participant's period of Service, the Participant engaged in an act which would have warranted termination from Service for Cause or (2) after termination, the Participant engaged in conduct that violates any continuing obligation or duty of the Participant set forth in any executive or restrictive covenant agreement with respect to non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, intellectual property or trade secret protection, or any similar agreement to which the Participant is a party in favor of the Company or any Subsidiary (any such event described in clause (i) or (ii), with respect to any Participant, a "Forfeiture Event" with respect to such Participant), then such Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to such an Award shall be subject to cancellation, forfeiture and/or recoupment, as provided in Section 13.3 below. The Company shall have the power to determine whether, and the date on which, any Forfeiture Event has occurred and whether to exercise the right of recapture provided in Section 13.3 below. Any such determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Participant. In addition, if the Company shall reasonably determine that a Forfeiture Event with respect to any Participant has occurred, then the Company may suspend such Participant's rights to exercise, receive any payment under, or vest in any right with respect to, any Award, pending a final determination by the Company of whether such an act has been committed. 
(b) Definition of Cause. Unless otherwise defined in an Award Agreement, "Cause" shall mean: 
(i) if a Participant has an effective employment agreement, service agreement or other similar agreement with the Company or any Subsidiary that defines "Cause" or a like term, the meaning set forth in such agreement at the time of the Participant's termination of Service; or, 
(ii) in the absence of such definition, (A) the Participant's breach of any fiduciary duty or material breach of any legal or contractual obligation to the Company or any of its Affiliates, or to the Company's direct or indirect equity holders, (B) the Participant's failure to follow the reasonable instructions of the Board or such Participant's direct supervisor, which breach, if curable, is not cured within ten (10) business days after notice to such Participant or, if cured, recurs within one hundred eighty (180) days, (C) the Participant's gross negligence, 
Page A-17 
 willful misconduct, fraud, or acts of dishonesty relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates, or (D) the Participant's conviction of any misdemeanor relating to the affairs of the Company or any of its Affiliates or indictment for any felony. 
13.3 Right of Recapture. 
(a) General. If a Forfeiture Event with respect to a Participant occurs at any time period within one (1) year (or such longer time specified in any Award Agreement or other agreement with a Participant) after the date on which any Award to such Participant is exercised, vests, becomes payable or is paid or the date on which gain or income is otherwise realized in connection with any such Award, then any gain or income realized by the Participant from the exercise, vesting, payment or other realization event in connection with such Award, shall be paid by the Participant to the Company upon written notice from the Company or the Committee, subject to applicable state or local law. Such gain or income shall be determined as of the date or dates on which such gain or income is realized by the Participant, without regard to any subsequent change in the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock. The Company shall, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, have the right to offset any such gain or income against any amounts otherwise owed to the Participant by the Company or any Subsidiary (whether as wages, vacation pay or pursuant to any benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement). 
(b) Accounting Restatement. If a Participant receives compensation pursuant to any Award calculated by reference to financial statements that are subsequently required to be restated in a way that would decrease the value of such compensation, then the Participant will, upon the written request of the Committee, forfeit and repay to the Company the difference between what the Participant received and what the Participant should have received based on the accounting restatement, in accordance with (i) the Company's compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy, as may be in effect from time to time, and (ii) any compensation recovery, "clawback" or similar policy made applicable by law, including the provisions of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules, regulations and requirements adopted thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or any national securities exchange on which the Company's equity securities may be listed, as may be in effect from time to time (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the "Policy"). By accepting an Award hereunder, each Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Policy shall apply to such Award, and all incentive-based compensation payable pursuant to such Award shall be subject to forfeiture and repayment pursuant to the terms of the Policy. Although not required to give effect to the provisions of this Section 13.3(b), the Committee may, as it deems appropriate, amend the Plan to reflect the terms of the Policy. 
14. Transfer, Leave of Absence, Etc. For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a termination of employment: 
(a) a transfer to the employment of the Company from a Subsidiary or from the Company to a Subsidiary, or from one Subsidiary to another Subsidiary; or 
(b) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee otherwise so provides in writing. 
15. General Provisions. 
15.1 Status of Plan. The Committee may (but shall not be obligated to) authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations to deliver stock or make payments with respect to Awards. 
15.2 Award Agreement. Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, which may include special terms for non U.S. Participants in a separate appendix, in a written or electronic form approved 
Page A-18 
 by the Committee setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock subject to or otherwise underlying the Award, the exercise price, base price or purchase price of the Award, the time or times at which an Award will become vested, exercisable or payable and the term of the Award. The Award Agreement may also set forth the effect on an Award of a Change in Control or a termination of Service under certain circumstances. The Award Agreement shall be subject to and shall (or shall be deemed to) incorporate, by reference or otherwise, all of the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan, and may also set forth other terms and conditions applicable to the Award as determined by the Committee consistent with the limitations of the Plan. The grant of an Award under the Plan shall not confer any rights upon the Participant holding such Award other than such terms, and subject to such conditions, as are specified in the Plan as being applicable to such type of Award (or to all Awards) or as are expressly set forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee need not require the execution of an Award Agreement by a Participant, in which case, acceptance of the Award by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the Participant to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as well as the administrative guidelines of the Company in effect from time to time. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the provisions of the Plan shall prevail. 
15.3 No Assignment or Transfer; Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.7(e) hereof or as otherwise determined by the Committee, Awards under the Plan shall not be assignable or transferable by the Participant, and shall not be subject in any manner to assignment, alienation, pledge, encumbrance or charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the death of a Participant, except as otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award Agreement, an outstanding Award may be exercised by or shall become payable to the Participant's beneficiary as designated by the Participant in the manner prescribed by the Committee or, in the absence of an authorized beneficiary designation, by a legatee or legatees of such Award under the participant's last will or by such Participant's executors, personal representatives or distributees of such Award in accordance with the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may provide in the terms of an Award Agreement or in any other manner prescribed by the Committee that the Participant shall have the right to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall be entitled to any rights, payments or other benefits specified under an Award following the Participant's death. 
15.4 Deferrals of Payment. The Committee may in its discretion permit a Participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to the Participant by virtue of (a) the exercise of a right or the satisfaction of vesting or other conditions with respect to an Award or (b) an election to receive shares of Common Stock (in lieu of compensation otherwise payable in cash) on a deferred basis pursuant to Section 11.3 hereof; provided, however, that such discretion shall not apply in the case of a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right. If any such deferral is to be permitted by the Committee, the Committee shall establish rules and procedures relating to such deferral in a manner intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, including, without limitation, the time when an election to defer may be made, the time period of the deferral and the events that would result in payment of the deferred amount, the interest or other earnings attributable to the deferral and the method of funding, if any, attributable to the deferred amount. 
15.5 No Right to Employment or Continued Service. Nothing in the Plan, in the grant of any Award or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Eligible Person or any Participant any right to continue in the Service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment or other service relationship of an Eligible Person or a Participant for any reason at any time. 
15.6 Rights as Stockholder. Except as may otherwise be provided herein, a Participant shall have no rights as a holder of shares of Common Stock with respect to any unissued securities covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record of such securities. Except as provided in Section 4.5 hereof or as otherwise determined by the Committee, no adjustment or other provision shall be made for dividends or other stockholder rights, except to the extent that the Award Agreement provides for dividend payments, dividend 
Page A-19 
 equivalent rights or other similar rights, it being understood that the Committee may provide for the payment of dividends and other distributions to the Participant at such times as paid to the stockholders or at the times of vesting or otherwise set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee may determine in its discretion the manner of delivery of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan, which may be by delivery of stock certificates, electronic account entry into new or existing accounts or any other means as the Committee, in its discretion, deems appropriate. The Committee may (a) require that the stock certificates (if any) be held in escrow by the Company (or any of its officers) for any shares of Common Stock, (b) cause the shares of Common Stock to be legended in order to comply with the securities laws or other applicable restrictions or, (c) should the shares of Common Stock be represented by book or electronic account entry rather than a certificate, take such steps to restrict transfer of such shares of Common Stock as the Committee considers necessary or advisable. 
15.7 Trading Policy Restrictions. Option exercises and other Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to the Company's insider trading policy or other trading or ownership policy-related restrictions, terms and conditions as in effect from time to time. 
15.8 Section 409A Compliance and Section 280G. 
(a) Section 409A. To the maximum extent possible, it is intended that the Plan and all Awards hereunder are, and shall be, exempt from or otherwise comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the regulations thereunder promulgated by the United States Department of Treasury (the "Treasury Regulations") and other guidance issued thereunder, and that the Plan and all Award Agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any (i) provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement, (ii) Award, payment or transaction or (iii) other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan is determined by the Committee to not comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued thereunder, the Committee shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such changes to the Plan or an Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary to comply with such requirements. No payment that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be made under the Plan or an Award Agreement upon a termination of Service will be made or provided unless and until such termination is also a "separation from service," as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code at the time of termination of Service with respect to an Award, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of any payments or benefits under the Award shall be deferred until the date that is six months following the Participant's termination of Service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the specified employee) and shall instead be paid (in a manner set forth in the Award Agreement) on the payment date that immediately follows the end of such six-month period (or death) or as soon as administratively practicable within thirty (30) days thereafter, but in no event later than the end of the applicable taxable year. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on a Participant by Section 409A of the Code or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
(b) Section 280G. 
(i) Anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the receipt of all payments or distributions by the Company in the nature of compensation to or for a Participant's benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise (a "Payment"), would subject the Participant to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the accounting firm which audited the Company prior to the corporate transaction which results in the application of such excise tax (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments to the Reduced Amount (as defined below). The Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Participant would have a greater Net After-Tax
Page A-20 
 Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Participant's Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount. If such a determination is not made by the Accounting Firm, the Participant shall receive all Payments to which Participant is entitled. 
(ii) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 15.8(b) shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date of termination or such earlier date as requested by the Company. For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Reduced Amount, such reduction shall be implemented by determining the Parachute Payment Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then reducing the Payments in order beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Payment Ratio. For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio, such Payments shall be reduced based on the time of payment of such Payments, with amounts having later payment dates being reduced first. For Payments with the same Parachute Payment Ratio and the same time of payment, such Payments shall be reduced on a pro rata basis (but not below zero) prior to reducing Payments with a lower Parachute Payment Ratio. In all cases, the reduction of Payments shall be implemented in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code. All other provisions of any agreement embodying the Payments shall remain in full force and effect. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. 
(iii) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Participant pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise which should not have been so paid or distributed (the "Overpayment") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of Participant pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise could have been so paid or distributed (the "Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, Participant shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no amount shall be payable by Participant to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of Participant together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 
(iv) For purposes hereof, the following terms have the meanings set forth below: (A) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the greatest amount of Payments that can be paid that would not result in the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code if the Accounting Firm determines to reduce Payments pursuant to this Section 15.8(b), (B) "Net After-Tax Receipt" shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on Participant with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to Participant's taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as Participant certifies, in Participant's sole discretion, as likely to apply to Participant in the relevant tax year(s), and (C) "Parachute Payment Ratio" shall mean a fraction the numerator of which is the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of the applicable Payment for purposes of Section 280G and the denominator of which is the intrinsic value of such Payment. 
15.9 Securities Law Compliance. No shares of Common Stock will be issued or transferred pursuant to an Award unless and until all then applicable requirements imposed by Federal and state securities and other laws, 
Page A-21 
 rules and regulations and by any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction, and by any exchanges upon which the shares of Common Stock may be listed, have been fully met. As a condition precedent to the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Award, the Company may require the Participant to take any reasonable action to meet such requirements. The Committee may impose such conditions on any shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under the requirements of any exchange upon which such shares of the same class are then listed, and under any blue sky or other securities laws applicable to such shares. 
15.10 Substitute Awards in Corporate Transactions. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Committee to grant Awards under the Plan in connection with the acquisition, whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction, of the business or assets of any corporation or other entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may grant Awards under the Plan to an employee, director or other individual service provider of another corporation who becomes an Eligible Person by reason of any such corporate transaction in substitution for awards previously granted by such corporation or entity to such person. The terms and conditions of the substitute Awards may vary from the terms and conditions that would otherwise be required by the Plan solely to the extent the Committee deems necessary for such purpose. Any such substitute awards shall not (a) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, (b) be subject to or counted against whether any of the Award limits specified in Sections 4.3, 4.4 or 10.7 hereof have been attained or (c) replenish the Share Reserve upon the occurrence of any event set forth in Section 4.2 hereof. 
15.11 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold automatically from any amount deliverable under the Award or otherwise, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the Plan. With respect to required withholding, Participants may elect (subject to the Company's automatic withholding right set out above) to satisfy the withholding requirement with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of the Plan, in whole or in part, by the methods described in Section 6.5 hereof with respect to Stock Options or by a method similar to the methods described in Section 6.5 hereof with respect to Awards other than Stock Options (except as otherwise set forth in an Award Agreement). 
15.12 Unfunded Plan. The adoption of the Plan and any reservation of shares of Stock or cash amounts by the Company to discharge its obligations hereunder shall not be deemed to create a trust or other funded arrangement. Except upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to an Award, any rights of a Participant under the Plan shall be those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company, and neither a Participant nor the Participant's permitted transferees or estate shall have any other interest in any assets of the Company by virtue of the Plan. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to implement or set aside funds in a grantor trust, subject to the claims of the Company's creditors or otherwise, to discharge its obligations under the Plan. The Plan is not subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time. 
15.13 Other Compensation and Benefit Plans. The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other share incentive or other compensation plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary, nor shall the Plan preclude the Company or any Subsidiary from establishing any other forms of share incentive or other compensation or benefit program for employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. The amount of any compensation deemed to be received by a Participant pursuant to an Award shall not constitute includable compensation for purposes of determining the amount of benefits to which a Participant is entitled under any other compensation or benefit plan or program of the Company or a Subsidiary, including, without limitation, under any pension or severance benefits plan, except to the extent specifically provided by the terms of any such plan or required by applicable law. 
Page A-22 
15.14 Plan Binding on Transferees. The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its transferees and assigns, and the Participant, the Participant's executor, personal representative(s), distributees, administrator, permitted transferees, assignees, beneficiaries, and legatee(s), as applicable. 
15.15 Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction. 
15.16 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The Plan and each Award Agreement and all claims, causes of action or proceedings (whether in contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to, the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice-of-law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Each Participant and each party to an Award Agreement agrees that it shall bring all claims, causes of action and proceedings (whether in contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of, or be related to, the Plan or any Award Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such claim, cause of action or proceeding, exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Chosen Court"), and hereby (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Court, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such proceeding in the Chosen Court, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Court is an inconvenient forum or does not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such claim or cause of action shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with such Award Agreement. 
15.17 No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine (i) whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional shares of Common Stock or (ii) whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated (in the case of this clause (ii), with no consideration paid therefor). 
15.18 No Guarantees Regarding Tax Treatment. Neither the Company nor the Committee make any guarantees to any person regarding the tax treatment of Awards or payments made under the Plan. Neither the Company nor the Committee has any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any tax on any person with respect to any Award under Section 409A of the Code, Section 4999 of the Code, Section 280G of the Code or otherwise and neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any liability to a person with respect thereto. 
15.19 Data Protection. By participating in the Plan, each Participant consents to the collection, processing, transmission and storage by the Company, its Subsidiaries and any third party administrators of any data of a professional or personal nature for the purposes of administering the Plan. 
15.20 Awards to Non-U.S. Employees, Non-Employee Directors or Consultants. To comply with the laws in countries other than the United States in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates operates or has employees, Non-Employee Directors, consultants or other personal service providers, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to: 
(a) determine which Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be covered by the Plan; 
(b) determine which employees, Non-Employee Directors, consultants or other personal service providers outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; 
(c) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to employees, Non-Employee Directors, consultants or other personal service providers outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws; 
Page A-23 
(d) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approvals; and 
(e) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable. 
Any subplans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures established under this Section 15.20 by the Committee shall be attached to this Plan document as appendices. 
16. Term; Amendment and Termination; Stockholder Approval. 
16.1 Term. The Plan shall be effective as of the later of (i) the date of adoption by the Board, which date is set forth below, and (ii) the effectiveness of the Form S-8 in connection with the Company's initial public offering (the "Effective Date"). 
16.2 Amendment and Termination. The Committee may from time to time and in any respect, amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan; provided, that, except as provided in Section 15.8, Section 15.20 or as otherwise determined by the Committee as it deems necessary to comply with applicable laws, no amendment, modification, suspension or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect any Award theretofore granted without the consent of the Participant or the permitted transferee of the Award. The Committee may seek the approval of any amendment, modification, suspension or termination by the Company's stockholders to the extent it deems necessary or advisable in its discretion for purposes of compliance with Section 162(m) or Section 422 of the Code, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market or other exchange or securities market or for any other purpose. 
This Plan was duly adopted and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company by resolution at a meeting held on the 25th day of June, 2015.
