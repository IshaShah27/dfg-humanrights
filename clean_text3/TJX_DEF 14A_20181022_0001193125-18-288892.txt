VOTING ITEM FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
The Board of Directors of The TJX Companies, Inc. ("TJX" or the "Company") is sending this proxy statement to you as a shareholder of TJX to solicit your proxy for the Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the "Special Meeting") on Monday, October 22, 2018, to vote on the following item: an amendment to the Company's Fourth Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), from 1,200,000,000 shares to 1,800,000,000 shares (the "Amendment") in connection with TJX's recently announced plan to effect a 2-for-1 stock split of its shares of Common Stock. 
The changes to the Certificate of Incorporation that would be enacted if the Amendment is adopted are set forth in the Appendix to this proxy statement. If shareholder approval of the Amendment is obtained at the Special Meeting, the Amendment will become effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
HOW TO VOTE YOUR SHARES 
If you owned TJX Common Stock at the close of business on Thursday, September 27, 2018, the record date for our Special Meeting, you are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Each of the 618,764,407 shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If you are a shareholder of record (meaning you hold TJX shares registered in your name), please follow the  instructions on the enclosed proxy card to indicate how you would like to vote. You may vote online or by telephone, using the toll-free telephone number provided, or you may sign and return the proxy card by mail. You can change or revoke your  proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special Meeting by voting later online or by telephone, returning a later-dated proxy card by mail, or delivering a written revocation to the Secretary of TJX at our corporate offices at 770 Cochituate  Road, Framingham, Massachusetts 01701.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If you are a street name holder (meaning you own TJX shares through a bank, broker, or other third party), please  follow the instructions on the voting instruction card you received with this proxy statement to have your shares voted and, if needed, to change or revoke your selection (or contact your bank, broker, or other third party holder for instructions).  You should also have a choice of methods to vote your shares and to change or revoke your voting instructions before the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
With proper documentation, you may also vote in person at the Special Meeting. Please see Voting Requirements and Practices on p. 5 for more information. 
You should review the entire proxy statement carefully before voting your shares. 
This proxy statement and proxy card are being first mailed to shareholders on or about the date of the notice of Special Meeting, October 1, 2018. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SPECIAL MEETING TO BE HELD ON OCTOBER 22, 2018: THIS PROXY STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.ENVISIONREPORTS.COM/TJXSPECIAL  PROPOSAL 1: APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
The Board of Directors recommends that you approve an amendment to Article Fourth of the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Company's authorized Common Stock from 1,200,000,000 to 1,800,000,000 shares. We are not requesting any increase to the authorized number of shares of preferred stock, which will remain unchanged at 5,000,000 shares. 
As of September 27, 2018, there were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  620,159,703             Shares of Common Stock issued 
  618,764,407             Shares of Common Stock outstanding 
  1,395,296             Shares held as treasury stock 
  49,920,102             Shares reserved for issuance under our existing equity compensation plan 
  529,920,195             Shares (approximately) available that could be authorized for future issuance 
[END TABLE]
The reason for the Amendment is to facilitate the Board of Directors' recently announced plan to effect a 2-for-1 stock split of our shares of Common Stock. The Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split by means of a stock dividend contingent upon approval by shareholders of the Amendment. The new shares would be payable on November 6, 2018 to each holder of record at the close of business on October 30, 2018. In connection with the stock split, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors would also make appropriate adjustments to our equity incentive plan and outstanding equity-based awards, including adjustments to the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under such plan and to the terms of such awards, in accordance with the provisions of the plan. 
Any authorized and unissued shares remaining after the stock split would be available for other general corporate purposes as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time, including for use under its compensation plans. Unless required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, no further vote of the shareholders will be required to issue such shares. 
The additional shares of Common Stock that would be authorized by this proposal would be identical to the shares of Common Stock the Company now has authorized. Holders of Common Stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to additional securities that may be issued by the Company. 
The Board of Directors has not proposed the increase in the amount of authorized shares with the intention of discouraging tender offers or takeover attempts of the Company. However, the availability of additional authorized shares for issuance may have the effect of discouraging a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempt to obtain control of the Company. 
If the Amendment is approved by the shareholders at the Special Meeting, the Certificate of Amendment will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the Amendment as soon as practicable after the Special Meeting. The form of the Certificate of Amendment that would be enacted if the Amendment is adopted is set forth in the Appendix to this proxy statement. 
The Amendment requires the approval of a majority of the shares outstanding entitled to vote thereon. You may vote for, against, or abstain on the Amendment. If you abstain from voting on the Amendment, your shares will not be counted as having been voted on that matter and will therefore have the same effect as a vote 'against' the Amendment, but will be counted as in attendance at the Special Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. 
Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR Proposal 1.  BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP
