    Why did I receive these proxy materials?  
    We are sending you this proxy statement as part of a solicitation by the board of directors of Liquidity Services, Inc. for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and at any adjournment or postponement that may take place. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "us," "we," "our" and the "Company" include Liquidity Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms "Board of Directors" and "Board" mean the board of directors of the Company.  
     You are invited to attend our Annual Meeting on Thursday, February 21, 2019, beginning at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The Annual Meeting will be held at the offices of Liquidity Services, Inc. at 6931 Arlington Road, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814.  
     This Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, proxy statement, proxy card and voting instructions and our 2018 Annual Report are first being mailed on or about January 22, 2019.  
    Do I need a ticket to attend the Annual Meeting?  
    You will need an admission ticket or proof of ownership to enter the Annual Meeting. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please vote your proxy prior to the Annual Meeting but keep the admission ticket and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting.  
     If your shares are held beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee and you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you must present proof of your ownership of Company common stock as of the close of business on January 8, 2019, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. If you would rather have an admission ticket, you may obtain one in advance by mailing a written request, along with proof of your ownership of Company stock, to:  
 Liquidity Services, Inc. Attn: Jaclyn Kushman 6931 Arlington Road, Suite 200  Bethesda, MD 20814  
     All stockholders also must present a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Annual Meeting.

As of the Record Date, there were 33,193,688 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. All holders of common stock shall vote together as a single class on each matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
    If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares. The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, proxy statement, proxy card and voting instructions and our fiscal 2018 Annual Report have been sent directly to you by the Company.  
     If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. Access to the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, proxy statement, voting instruction card and voting instructions and our fiscal 2018 Annual Report are being provided to you by your bank, broker or other nominee, who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you may direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card included in the mailing or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet (if available).  
    How do I vote?  
    You may vote using the following methods:  
     By Mail  
     Complete, sign and date the proxy card or voting instruction card and return it in the prepaid envelope. If you are a stockholder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named in the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors set forth under "What are the voting requirements for the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?" below.  
     If you are a stockholder of record, and the prepaid envelope is missing, please mail your completed proxy card to Liquidity Services, Inc., 6931 Arlington Road, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814, Attn: VP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  
     By Telephone or on the Internet  
     The telephone and Internet voting procedures established by the Company for stockholders of record authenticate your identity, allow you to give your voting instructions and confirm those instructions have been properly recorded.  
     You may vote by calling the toll-free telephone number on your proxy card. Please have your proxy card in hand when you call. Easy-to-follow voice prompts allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you are located outside the United States, see your proxy card for additional instructions.  
     The website for Internet voting is www.envisionreports.com/LQDT for shares you hold directly in your name as the stockholder of record with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., and www.edocumentview.com/LQDT for shares you hold as a beneficial owner in street name. Please have your proxy card available when you go online. As with telephone voting, you can confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote on the Internet, you also can request electronic delivery of future proxy materials.  
     Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day, and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 20, 2019.  
     The availability of telephone and Internet voting for beneficial owners will depend on the voting processes of your broker, bank or other nominee, and we recommend that you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive from them.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     If you vote by telephone or on the Internet, do not return your proxy card or voting instruction card.  
     In Person at the Annual Meeting  
     All stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You will need an admission ticket or proof of ownership to enter the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you must present proof of your ownership of Company stock as of the close of business on January 8, 2019, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. If you would rather have an admission ticket, you may obtain one in advance by mailing a written request, along with proof of your ownership of Company stock as of the close of business on January 8, 2019, to: Liquidity Services, Inc., Attn: Jaclyn Kushman, 6931 Arlington Road, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814. All stockholders also must present a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting.  
     You may also be represented by another person at the Annual Meeting by executing a legal proxy designating that person. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee and present it to the inspectors of election with your ballot to vote at the Annual Meeting.  
    What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares?  
    If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy before it is exercised by:  
• sending written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company;  
• delivering a valid, later-dated proxy or a later-dated vote by telephone or on the Internet prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
     If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you can revoke your proxy before it is exercised by contacting your broker, bank or other nominee and submitting new voting instructions. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described in the answer to the previous question.  
     All shares represented by properly executed proxies received before the Annual Meeting and not revoked will be voted under the instructions stated in such proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted under the recommendations of the Board of Directors set forth under "What are the voting requirements for the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?" below.  
    What shares can I vote?  
    You can vote all shares that you owned on the Record Date. These shares include (1) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record; and (2) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee. Each outstanding share of Company stock entitles its holder to cast one vote for each director nominee and one vote on each other matter to be voted upon.  
    What is "householding" and how does it affect me?  
    We have adopted a procedure approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of record with the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of our Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and proxy statement and fiscal 2018 Annual Report, unless one or more of these stockholders notifies us they wish to receive an individual copy. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees and conserves natural resources.  
     Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     If you are eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and proxy statement and fiscal 2018 Annual Report, or if you hold stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy of each document for your household, please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (in writing: c/o Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000, or, to c/o Shareholder Services, 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, from within the United States by telephone: (800) 662-7232; from outside the United States by telephone: (781) 575-2879).  
     If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of this Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and proxy statement and fiscal 2018 Annual Report, please contact Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as stated above and, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of these documents will be delivered to you promptly. Additionally, if you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of these documents, please contact Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as stated above.  
     If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may request information about householding from your broker, bank or other nominee.  
    Is there a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
    The names of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for ten days prior to the Annual Meeting for any purpose germane to the Annual Meeting, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, at our principal executive offices at 6931 Arlington Road, Suite 200, Bethesda, MD 20814, by contacting the Corporate Secretary of the Company.  
    How can I vote on each matter?  
    In the election of directors, you may vote "for" one or more nominees, or your vote may be "withheld" from one or more nominees. For the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and approval of the advisory resolution on executive compensation, you may vote "for" or "against," or you may indicate that you wish to "abstain" from voting on the matter.   
    What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?  
    The presence of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.  
     Brokers, banks and other nominees may not vote without instructions from the beneficial owner in the election of directors or on the advisory resolution on executive compensation. Therefore, if your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, they will not be voted on these matters unless you affirmatively vote your shares in one of the ways described above. If you are a beneficial owner, your broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares on the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm even if the broker, bank or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from you.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What are the voting requirements for the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?  
    A plurality of the votes cast is required for the election of directors. This means that the director nominees with the most "for" votes will be elected. Thus, shares as to which a stockholder withholds voting authority and broker non-votes will not be counted towards any director nominee's achievement of a plurality and will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. Stockholders may not cumulate their votes in favor of any one nominee.  
     A majority of the votes cast by stockholders present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and to approve the advisory resolution on executive compensation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of these items.  
     If you are a registered holder and sign your proxy card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board ("for" all director nominees named in the proxy statement, "for" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, and "for" the approval of the advisory resolution on executive compensation).  
    Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?  
    As of the date of this proxy statement, we did not know of any matters to be acted on at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement.  
     If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, the proxy holders named on the proxy card will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.  
    Can I access the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and proxy statement on the Internet?  
    The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and proxy statement are available under the Investors section of our website at www.liquidityservices.com. Instead of receiving future copies of our proxy statement by mail, most stockholders can elect to receive an e-mail that will include electronic links to our proxy statement. Opting to receive your proxy materials online will save us the cost of producing and mailing documents to your home or business, and also will give you an electronic link to the proxy voting site.  
     Stockholders of Record: You may enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service at any time in the future by going directly to www.computershare.com/investor and following the enrollment instructions.  
     Beneficial Owners: If you hold your shares in a brokerage account, you also can receive copies of these documents electronically. Please check the information provided in the proxy materials mailed to you by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding the availability of this service.  
    Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?  
    We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or employees, acting without special compensation, in person or by telephone, electronic transmission or facsimile transmission.  
    Who will count the vote?  
    Representatives of our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will tabulate the votes and act as inspectors of election.
