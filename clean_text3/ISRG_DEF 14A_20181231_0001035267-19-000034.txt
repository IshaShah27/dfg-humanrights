Our stockholders are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.

Our principal executive offices are located at 1020 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086, and our main telephone number is (408) 523-2100.
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?
We are pleased to continue to take advantage of the SEC rules that allow us to furnish our proxy materials to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Accordingly, most of our stockholders of record and beneficial owners have received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") and will not receive a full set of proxy materials in the mail unless requested. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet may be found on the website referred to in the Notice. If you would like 
Table of Contents to receive our proxy materials electronically by email, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials provided in the Notice. Your election to receive proxy materials electronically by email will remain in effect until you terminate such election. Choosing to receive future proxy materials electronically by email will reduce the environmental impact and the costs incurred by us in printing and mailing the proxy materials.
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?
Registered and Beneficial Stockholders
You can view the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com.
Who may vote at the Annual Meeting?
The Board set March 1, 2019, as the record date for the Annual Meeting. All stockholders of record who owned Intuitive Surgical common stock at the close of business on March 1, 2019, are entitled to receive notice of, to attend, and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of the Intuitive Surgical common stock has one vote on each matter, and there is no cumulative voting. At the close of business on the record date, there were 115,361,354 shares of common stock outstanding.
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC ("Computershare"), you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice was sent directly to you by the Company. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials, you will receive a proxy card by mail.
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice is forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials, you will receive a voting instruction form by mail.
How can I vote my shares?
In Person — If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee or trustee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name. If you are a beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the organization that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting.
Via the Internet — You may vote by proxy via the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com.
By Telephone — If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number found on the voting instruction form.
By Mail — If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, and if you are a stockholder of record, you may also vote by proxy by filling out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail and you are a beneficial owner, you may vote by proxy by filling out the voting instruction form and sending it back in the envelope provided.
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?
The holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present at the Annual Meeting for the transaction of business. This is called a quorum. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, whether representing votes for, against, or abstained, if you:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• are present and vote in person at the Annual Meeting; or 
• have voted on the Internet, by telephone or by properly submitting a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Broker non-votes will also be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining if there is a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.
How are proxies voted?
All shares represented by valid proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted and, where a stockholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the stockholder's instructions.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, or 
• sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, 
[END TABLE]
then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote."
Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"?
The ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 3) is considered a routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 3.
The election of directors (Proposal No. 1), the advisory approval of the compensation of our NEOs (Proposal No. 2), the approval of the amendment and restatement of the 2010 Incentive Award Plan (Proposal No. 4), and the stockholder proposal regarding elimination of supermajority voting provisions (Proposal No. 5) are matters considered non-routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore there may be broker non-votes on these five proposals.
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?
For Proposal No. 1, each director must be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director by the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director, with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as votes cast as either "FOR" or "AGAINST" such director's election.
Approval of Proposals No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and No. 5 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" Proposals No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and No. 5. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for Proposal No. 2, No. 4, and No. 5 and broker non-votes are generally not expected for Proposal No. 3.
How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated?
Shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or broker non-votes will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares voted "ABSTAIN" on proposals other than Proposal No. 1 will have the same effect as voting against the matter. Brokers, banks, and other nominees have the power to vote without receiving voting instructions from beneficial owners on Proposal No. 3, so the Company expects no broker non-votes on this proposal. For Proposals No. 1, No. 2, No. 4, and No. 5, broker non-votes are not deemed to be entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether stockholder approval of a matter has been obtained. As a result, broker non-votes are not included in the tabulation of voting results for these proposals for 
Table of Contents purposes of determining whether proposals have been approved. In order to minimize the number of broker non-votes, the Company encourages you to provide voting instructions to the organization that holds your shares by carefully following instructions provided on the Notice.
Can I change my vote?
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is actually voted at the Annual Meeting by any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delivering written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at 1020 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California 94086. 
• Submitting a later dated proxy. 
• Attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
[END TABLE]
Your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, constitute revocation of your proxy. You may also be represented by another person present at the Annual Meeting by executing a form of proxy designating that person to act on your behalf. Shares may only be voted by or on behalf of the record holder of shares as indicated in our stock transfer records. If you are a beneficial stockholder but your shares are held of record by another person, such as a stock brokerage firm or bank, that person must vote the shares as the record holder in accordance with the beneficial holder's instructions.
Who bears the cost of proxy solicitation and who is soliciting proxies on our behalf?
We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies, including the expense of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the proxies we solicit. Proxies will be solicited by mail, telephone, personal contact and electronic means. We have retained Mackenzie Partners, Inc. to solicit proxies for a fee of $12,000 plus a reasonable amount to cover out-of-pocket expenses for proxy solicitation services. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers, and employees in person, by the Internet, by telephone or by fax, without additional remuneration. Copies of proxy materials and our 2018 Annual Report will be supplied to brokers and other nominees for the purpose of soliciting proxies from beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such brokers or other nominees for their reasonable expenses.
Who will serve as the inspector of election?
A representative from Veaco Group will serve as the inspector of election to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting.
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and published in our current report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting.
How can I attend the Annual Meeting?
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2019. Admission to the Annual Meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Each stockholder may be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and proof of stock ownership as of the record date. The use of cell phones, smartphones, pagers, recording and photographic equipment, and/or computers is not permitted in the meeting rooms at the Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
The chairperson of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of your proposal if it is not made in compliance with the foregoing procedures or the applicable provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"). Our Bylaws also provide for separate notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a director or to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting outside the processes of Rule 14a-8. To be considered timely under these provisions, the stockholder's notice must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above no earlier than December 27, 2019, and no later than January 26, 2020. If the date of our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after April 25, 2020, the stockholder's notice must be received not later than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. A stockholder providing such notice must also further update and supplement such notice so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is 10 business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than 5 business days after the record date for the meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date) and not later than 8 business days prior to the date for the meeting or, if practicable, any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which the meeting has been adjourned or postponed) (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of 10 business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. We recommend that any stockholder wishing to make a nomination for director or to bring any other item before an annual meeting, other than proposals intended to be included in the proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8, review a copy of our Bylaws, as amended and restated to date, which can be found at www.intuitive.com or, without charge, from our Corporate Secretary at the address above.
In addition, our Bylaws permit certain of our stockholders who have beneficially owned 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to submit nominations to be included in the our proxy materials for up to 25% of the total number of directors then serving. Notice of proxy access director nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address noted above no earlier than December 27, 2019 and no later than the close of business on January 26, 2020. The notice must set forth the information required by our Bylaws with respect to each proxy access director nomination that an eligible stockholder or stockholders intend to present at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and must otherwise be in compliance with our Bylaws.

DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
General Information
The Board is composed of a group of leaders with broad and diverse experience in many fields, including:  management of large global enterprises, technology and innovation leadership, and healthcare. In these positions, they have also gained industry knowledge and significant and diverse management experience, including strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development. Many of the directors also have experience serving as executive officers, or on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends. Other directors have significant academic and research experience and bring unique perspectives to the Board.
The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board and the Board believe the skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences of its current directors provide the Company with business acumen and a diverse range of perspectives to engage each other and management to effectively address the evolving needs of the Company and represent the best interests of the Company's stockholders.
The Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates candidates recommended by stockholders using the same criteria as used for other candidates recommended by its members, other members of the Board, or other persons. The criteria are described in detail in the Nomination Process section below. In addition, our Bylaws permit a stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders, director candidates constituting up to 25% of the Board, provided that the stockholder (or group) and each nominee satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws.
The Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of directors. As such, in an election where the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director will be elected to the Board if the number of shares voted for the nominee exceeds the number of shares voted against the nominee. The majority voting standard would not apply, however, if the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In that case, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting would be elected.
The majority voting standard will apply to the election taking place at the meeting. Consequently, in order to be elected, a nominee must receive more "for" votes than "against" votes. Proxies may not be voted for more than the nine nominees, and stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. In the event any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the meeting, the proxies will be voted for such nominee, if any, as may be designated by the Board to fill the vacancy. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board is not aware that any nominee is unable or will decline to serve as a director.
Nominees for Director
The names of the directors being nominated for election and their ages as of February 15, 2019, are set forth below. The following biographies describe the principal occupations, positions, and directorships for at least the past five years of the nominees for director, as well as certain information regarding their individual experiences, qualifications, attributes, and skills that led the Board to conclude that they should serve on the Board, are described below. There are no family relationships among any of our director nominees or executive officers.

Board Size
The number of authorized directors constituting the full Board is currently set at ten and will be reduced to nine immediately prior to the Annual Meeting. The Board evaluates the appropriateness of the size of the Board from time to time. In evaluating the size of the Board, the Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee consider a number of factors, including (i) resignations and retirements from the current Board; (ii) the availability of appropriate and qualified candidates; (iii) balancing the desire of having a small enough Board to facilitate deliberations with, at the same time, having a large enough Board to have the diversity of knowledge, experience, skills, and expertise to ensure that the Board and its committees can effectively perform their responsibilities in overseeing the Company's business; and (iv) the goal of having an appropriate mix of inside and independent directors. 
Nomination Process
The Governance and Nominating Committee identifies director nominees by reviewing the desired experience, mix of skills, and other qualities to assure appropriate Board composition, taking into consideration the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders, and any such recommendations should be sent to the Corporate Secretary in writing at the executive offices as identified in this Proxy Statement. Such recommendations should comply with the notice and other requirements set forth in the Bylaws, including but not limited to stating the following information:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name and address of such nominating stockholder and the class or series and number of shares of securities of the Company that are, directly or indirectly, owned of record or beneficially owned by such stockholder. 
• Whether the nominating stockholder intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to elect such nominee. 
• Interests of the nominating stockholder required to be disclosed under the Bylaws. 
• All information relating to such proposed nominee that is required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required in a contested election (including such proposed nominee's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected). 
• A description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among any nominating stockholder, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, his or her respective affiliates and associates, on the other hand. 
• A completed and signed questionnaire, representation, and agreement as provided in the Bylaws. 
[END TABLE]
The Company will also request such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence or lack of independence of such proposed nominee. Any recommendations received from stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as potential nominees suggested by Board members, management, or other parties. 
In addition, the Bylaws permit certain of the Company's stockholders who have beneficially owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to submit nominations to be included in proxy materials for up to 25% of the total number of directors then serving. Notice of proxy access director nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the principal executive offices no earlier than December 27, 2019 and no later than January 26, 2020. The notice must be set forth the information required by the Bylaws with respect to each proxy access director nomination that an eligible stockholder or stockholders intend to present at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and must otherwise be in compliance with the Bylaws.  
The Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates director candidates based upon a number of criteria, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The desired experience, mix of skills, and other qualities to assure appropriate Board composition, taking into account the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board. 
• The experience, knowledge, skills, and expertise of candidates, which may include experience in management, finance, marketing and accounting, across a broad range of industries with particular emphasis on healthcare and medical device industries, along with experience operating at a policy-making level in an appropriate business, financial, governmental, educational, non-profit, technological, or global field.

• Diversity of backgrounds and perspectives, including those backgrounds and perspectives with respect to business experience, professional expertise, age, gender, and ethnic background. 
• Personal and professional integrity, character, and business judgment of candidates. 
• Whether candidates are independent, including as determined by the independence requirements of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Nominating Committee assesses the effectiveness of its approach to consideration of Board candidates as part of its evaluation of the Board's composition to ensure that the Board reflects the knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, and diversity required for the Board to fulfill its duties. 
Board Responsibilities and Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board's primary responsibility is to exercise their business judgment in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board selects the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, monitors management's and the Company's performance, and provides advice and counsel to management. Among other things, the Board at least annually reviews the Company's long-term strategy, long-term business plan, and an annual budget for the Company. The Board also reviews and approves transactions in accordance with guidelines that the Board may adopt from time to time. In fulfilling the Board's responsibilities, directors have full access to the Company's management, external auditors, and outside advisors. With respect to the Board's role in risk oversight of the Company, the Board discusses the Company's risk exposures and risk management of various parts of the business, including appropriate guidelines and policies to minimize business risks and major financial risks and the steps management has undertaken to control them.
The Board has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities and to serve the interests of the Company and its stockholders. These guidelines serve as a framework for, among other things, the composition and selection of members of the Board, director orientation and continuing education, responsibilities of directors, conduct of Board meetings, structure and conduct of Board committees, succession planning and oversight of risk management. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on its website at www.intuitive.com.
Board Leadership
The Company is focused on its corporate governance practices and values independent board oversight as an essential component of strong corporate performance to enhance stockholder value. Its commitment to independent oversight is demonstrated by the fact that all of its directors, except the President and Chief Executive Officer, are independent under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, all of the members of the Board's committees are independent under such standards. The Board acts independently of management and regularly holds independent director sessions of the Board without members of management present.
Mr. Smith is the Chairman of the Board and Dr. Guthart is the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board. The Board has determined that the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is appropriate at this time as it allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus primarily on management responsibilities and corporate strategy, while allowing the Chairman to focus on leadership of the Board, providing feedback and advice to the Chief Executive Officer and providing a channel of communication between the Board members and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board presides over all Board meetings and works with the Chief Executive Officer to develop agendas for Board meetings. The Chairman advises the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management on business strategy and leadership development. He also works with the Board to drive decisions about particular strategies and policies and, in concert with the independent Board committees, facilitates a performance evaluation process of the Board.
Since April 2018, Dr. Barratt has served as our Lead Director. The Lead Director is elected annually by a majority of the independent directors upon receiving a recommendation from the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Lead Director's responsibilities include, among others:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presiding at meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors. 
• Providing feedback from executive sessions of the independent directors at which the Chairman is not present, to the Chairman, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other senior management. 
• Consulting with the Chairman as to an appropriate schedule of Board meetings. 
• Approving meeting agendas for the Board.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advising the Chairman as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the information submitted by the Company's management that is necessary or appropriate for the independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties. 
[END TABLE]
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Governance and Nominating Committee. The Board and its committees set schedules to meet throughout the year and also can hold special meetings and act by written consent from time to time, as appropriate. The Board has delegated various responsibilities and authority to the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee as described below. These committees regularly report on their activities and actions to the full Board. Each of these committees of the Board has a written charter approved by the Board which is available on our website at www.intuitive.com. The Board from time to time establishes additional committees to address specific needs. 
During 2018, the Board held four meetings. Each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she has been a director and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served during the periods that he or she served.
The following table reflects the current membership of each Board committee:

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the full Board in its general oversight of our financial reporting, internal controls, and audit functions, and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the annual audited and quarterly financial statements (including the related disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q), reviews the integrity of the financial reporting processes, both internal and external, reviews the qualifications, performance and independence of the registered public accounting firm, and prepares the Audit Committee Report included in the Proxy Statement in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee discusses policies with respect to financial and cyber security risk assessment and risk management, including appropriate guidelines and policies to govern the processes, as well as the Company's major financial and cyber security risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to address them. The responsibilities and activities of the Audit Committee are described in further detail in the "Audit Committee Report" in this proxy statement and the Audit Committee's charter, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website at www.intuitive.com.
During 2018, the Audit Committee consisted of Michael A. Friedman, M.D., Don R. Kania, Ph.D., Keith R. Leonard, Jr., and Mark J. Rubash. The Board has determined that all of the Audit Committee members meet the independence and experience requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the SEC and that Mr. Rubash is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under applicable rules of the SEC. In 2018, the Audit Committee met nine times. 
Table of Contents
Governance and Nominating Committee
The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for matters relating to the corporate governance of the Company and the nomination of members of the Board, the Lead Director, and committees thereof. The Board has determined that all of the Governance and Nominating Committee members meet the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The responsibilities and activities of the Governance and Nominating Committee are described in the Governance and Nominating Committee charter, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website at www.intuitive.com.
In 2018, the Governance and Nominating Committee met twice. 
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all compensation programs applicable to executive officers of the Company, including salaries, bonuses, and equity compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer in light of those goals and objectives, and sets the Chief Executive Officer's compensation level based on this evaluation. The Compensation Committee approves any new compensation plan or any material change to an existing compensation plan whether or not subject to stockholder approval and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the Company's incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans subject to stockholder approval. The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses with management the disclosures regarding executive compensation and inclusion of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") included in the annual proxy statements. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee.
In 2018, the Compensation Committee directly engaged an independent compensation consultant, Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), to provide analysis, advice, and guidance on compensation matters.
The Board has determined that all of the Compensation Committee members meet the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the SEC. In 2018, the Compensation Committee met three times. The Compensation Committee operates under a charter that can be found on the Company's website at www.intuitive.com.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During 2018, the Compensation Committee consisted of Amal M. Johnson, Jami Dover Nachtsheim, and Alan J. Levy, Ph.D., none of whom is a present or former officer or employee of the Company. In addition, during 2018, none of the Company's officers had an "interlock" relationship, as that term is defined by the SEC.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting
The Company encourages, but does not require, its Board members to attend each annual meeting of stockholders. All then-members of the Board attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Dr. Kania joined the Board in July 2018 and, therefore, did not attend the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

COMPENSATION FOR DIRECTORS
We compensate our non-employee directors for their service on our Board with a combination of cash and equity awards. The compensation provided is commensurate with their role and involvement, and consistent with competitive market practices. We provide a majority of the compensation in the form of equity to align the interests of our non-employee directors with the interests of our stockholders. We do not compensate our Chief Executive Officer for serving on our Board in addition to his regular employee compensation.
The Compensation Committee, consisting solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility for reviewing and considering any changes to our director compensation program. Our Board determines the form and amount of director compensation after reviewing the committee's recommendation.
The Compensation Committee reviews total compensation of our non-employee directors every other year and evaluates the appropriate level and form of their compensation. In making its recommendations, the committee considers the amount of time our non-employee directors expend, as well as the skill level required of members of our Board in fulfilling their duties. It also considers the Company's financial performance, general market conditions, and advice from its independent compensation consultant, including the independent analysis of our director compensation program that is updated on a biannual basis. As part of this analysis, the compensation consultant reviews and analyzes competitive market practices in director compensation as represented by the companies in our compensation peer group. The analysis also examines how director compensation levels, practices, and design features compare to the constituent members of the compensation peer group, which is the same peer group used as a reference when setting executive compensation. The committee also considers the extent to which our Board's compensation practices align with the interests of our stockholders. 
Our Board reviews the Compensation Committee's recommendations and then determines the form and amount of compensation for our non-employee directors. Our Board sets cash compensation levels with reference to the median of the competitive market and equity compensation levels to approximate the 75th percentile of the competitive market.
Following a review with its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee determined that the compensation of our non-employee directors was consistent generally with the compensation for non-employee directors at the companies in the compensation peer group and recommended that no changes be made to the amounts of non-employee director compensation for 2018.
During 2018, our director compensation program consisted of cash and equity compensation elements, as further described below.
Annual Cash Compensation
We provide cash compensation through retainers for Board and committee service, as well as separate retainers to the chairpersons and members of our Board committees. Compensation in this manner simplifies the administration of our program and creates greater equality in rewarding service on committees of our Board. The committee and committee chair retainers compensate directors for the additional responsibilities and time commitments involved with those positions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board or Committee Position   Cash Retainer ($) 
General Annual Board Retainer   60,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Audit Committee Chair   23,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Compensation Committee Chair   20,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Governance and Nominating Committee Chair   13,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Audit Committee Member   10,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Compensation Committee Member   6,000   
Additional Annual Retainer - Governance and Nominating Committee Member   4,000   
[END TABLE]
Cash compensation is pro-rated for the time served by a director on the Board and any Board committees.
Table of Contents
Equity Compensation
Non-employee directors receive grants of stock options and restricted stock unit awards which vest 100% on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) the next annual meeting of stockholders following the grant date, subject to continued service through such vesting date.
During 2018, the non-employee directors received the following equity compensation granted at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Directors   2018  RSU  Value ($) (1)  2018 Stock Option  Value ($) (2)
Directors   2018  RSU  Value ($) (1)  2018 Stock Option  Value ($) (2)
Chairman of the Board   190,000     190,000   
Lead Director   165,000     165,000   
Members of the Board   140,000     140,000   
(1) The number of RSUs granted is determined by taking the RSU Value and dividing by the 90 calendar-day average closing trading price of the Company's common stock reported by Nasdaq through the date of grant. 
(2) The number of shares underlying the stock options granted is determined by taking the Stock Option Value and dividing by one-third of the 90 calendar-day average closing trading price of the Company's common stock reported by Nasdaq through the date of grant; provided that in no event shall the number of shares underlying the option exceed the number of shares underlying the 2015 annual option grant.   
[END TABLE]
New non-employee directors receive a pro-rated equity grant based on the number of months remaining between appointment date and the expected date of the next annual grant.
The equity compensation program for our non-employee directors for 2019 is similar to the program described above for 2018.
Our stock ownership policy requires non-employee directors to own shares of our common stock having a total value equal to four times their aggregate annual cash retainer for serving as a member of our Board, not including any meeting fees, incentive awards, or committee, chair, or other similar retainers. These mandatory ownership guidelines are intended to create a clear standard that encourages our directors to remain invested in the performance of the Company's stock price. Each non-employee director has five years from the date he or she becomes subject to the stock ownership guidelines to come into compliance with the guidelines. All of our non-employee directors met the guidelines or were on track to comply with the guidelines in the relevant time frame as of the date of this proxy statement. For the purposes of determining stock ownership levels, the following forms of equity interests in the Company are included: shares owned outright by, or held in trust for the benefit of, the director or his or her spouse or children sharing the same household; shares held through a fund or other entity as to which the director has control; shares of the Company's common stock, stock units or other stock equivalents obtained through the exercise of stock options or vesting of Company equity awards; shares of common stock underlying vested stock options net of shares that would need to be withheld for the exercise price; and other stock or stock equivalent awards determined by the Compensation Committee.
The aggregate grant date fair value of total equity compensation (consisting of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and any other equity compensation) to any non-employee director in any calendar year in respect of such director's service as a member of our Board or any Board committee during such year shall not exceed $750,000. Our Board has determined that imposing such a limit is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
We reimburse non-employee directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of their duties as directors of the Company.

Executive Summary
The primary objective of our executive compensation program is to attract and retain a passionate team of executives who drive innovation that enables physicians and healthcare providers to improve the quality of and access to minimally invasive care. We seek to accomplish this goal in a way that is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our strategy has been to provide a level of fairness within our programs to drive alignment of all employees including our NEOs. This approach recognizes that as a company we are all one team with one mission. We believe our executive compensation program effectively aligns the interests of our NEOs with our objective of creating sustainable long-term value. 
Results of Stockholder Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we conducted a stockholder advisory vote on the 2017 compensation of our then NEOs (commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" vote). Our stockholders approved the 2017 compensation of our then NEOs, with approximately 95% of the votes cast voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee took the results of this Say-on-Pay vote into consideration when making compensation decisions following the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
We believe that the outcome of the Say-on-Pay vote reflects our stockholders' support of our compensation philosophy, specifically our efforts to attract, retain, and motivate our executive officers, including our NEOs. Accordingly, no significant design changes were made to the executive compensation program as a result of the Say-on-Pay vote on 2017 NEO compensation. Further, any design changes resulting from the Say-on-Pay vote would not typically affect compensation until the following fiscal year due to the timing of our annual meeting of stockholders relative to the Compensation Committee meeting at which compensation decisions are made.
We value the opinions of our stockholders and will continue to consider the outcome of future Say-on-Pay votes, as well as feedback received throughout the year, when making compensation decisions for our executive officers, including our NEOs.
Based on the results of a separate stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding the compensation of our NEOs conducted at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our Board determined that we will hold Say-on-Pay votes on an annual basis.

2018 Financial Highlights
In 2018, we continued to grow the number of procedures performed worldwide using our products. In the U.S., the procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures as well as moderate growth in more mature gynecologic and urologic procedures. International procedure growth was primarily driven by continued growth in prostatectomy and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, and gynecology.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
Consistent with our business results, the Compensation Committee took the following actions with respect to the 2018 compensation of our NEOs:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses. The 2018 Corporate Incentive Program (the "CIP"), our annual performance-based cash incentive program, for our NEOs was funded at 108.2% and paid out in February 2019. The CIP was funded based on our actual level of achievement as measured against a pre-established adjusted operating income goal and pre-established strategic Company performance goals. See the section entitled "Annual Performance-Based Cash Bonuses" below for a detailed discussion of the CIP. 
• Base Salary. Base salaries were increased on average 3% - 4% for our NEOs and slightly higher for those who also received a promotional increase. These base salary increases took into consideration the changes in responsibility for each NEO, the competitive market for executive talent, Company performance, and the other factors described in the section entitled "Executive Compensation Elements" below. 
• Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee granted equity awards in the form of stock options and RSUs. The size of each award was based on several factors including managing the Company's burn rate, reducing our equity overhang in the long run, maintaining our ability to compete for outstanding talent, maintaining our corporate compensation philosophies, and the executive officer's experience and performance. 
[END TABLE]
Pay for Performance
We believe our executive compensation program is closely aligned with stockholders' interests. While base salary and an annual performance-based cash bonus opportunity incentivize the achievement of shorter-term goals, our long-term equity awards in the form of stock options, which are typically subject to either a 4-year or 3.5-year vesting requirement and a 10-year term, and RSUs which are typically subject to a 4-year vesting requirement, represent a longer-term compensation structure that promotes retention and continuous commitment to the operating results of the Company. We further believe this compensation mix rewards each executive officer for their individual contributions to the Company, both present and future. At this phase in our growth cycle, a majority of the annual total direct compensation of our executive officers is directly tied, through the use of stock options and RSUs, to the growth in the value of our common stock. To illustrate this point, the following chart displays the historical relationship between the annual total direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, and the changes in stockholder value as reflected by the percentage change in value of the market price of our common stock.
Table of Contents
For illustration purposes, our Chief Executive Officer's annual total direct compensation consists of base salary paid, annual cash bonus earned, and the grant date fair value of his long-term equity awards (including stock options and RSUs) granted in the following year. The chart assumes a like number of stock options to the February 15, 2019, grant will be granted on August 15, 2019, using the same Black-Scholes fair value as of February 15, 2019. Our stock return is calculated based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the fiscal year end. The stock return is indexed to 2014 such that it represents the stock price percentage change over the 2014 fiscal year end price of $176.31, and our Chief Executive Officer's annual total direct compensation is similarly indexed to his 2014 annual total direct compensation.
Executive Compensation Policies and Practices
The Compensation Committee has adopted and is committed to maintaining a comprehensive governance framework for executive compensation which aligns with long-term stockholder interests. This framework includes the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independence. The Compensation Committee is comprised solely of independent directors. 
• Independent Adviser. The Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, Compensia, to provide analysis, advice and guidance on compensation matters. 
• Biennial Executive Compensation Review. The Compensation Committee reviews a biennial compensation assessment prepared by Compensia which includes approval of the executive compensation strategy and philosophy and peer group of companies. 
• Succession Planning. We review the risks associated with key executive officer positions and endeavor to ensure adequate succession plans are in place. 
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. We maintain stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers and members of our Board. 
• Compensation At-Risk. Our executive compensation program is designed so a significant portion of compensation is "at risk" based on corporate performance, including equity-based compensation, to align the interests of our executive officers and stockholders. 
• No Employment Agreements. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. All executive officers are employed "at will."  
• No Executive Retirement Plans. We do not provide pensions or other supplemental executive retirement health, or insurance benefits. 
• No Executive Perquisites. We do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers that are not otherwise available on the same basis to our other full-time employees. 
• No Special Health or Welfare Benefits. Our executive officers participate in broad-based company-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full-time, salaried employees. 
• No Tax Reimbursements. We do not provide any tax reimbursement payments (including "gross-ups") on any element of executive compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Double-Trigger" Change-in-Control Arrangements. All change-in-control payments and benefits pursuant to the Company-wide change in control plan are based on a "double-trigger" arrangement (that is, they require both a change-in-control of the Company plus a qualifying termination of employment before payments and benefits are paid). 
• No Repricing. All of the Company's equity plans expressly prohibit stock option repricing without stockholder approval. 
• No Buyout of Underwater Options. All of the Company's active equity plans also expressly prohibit the Company from buying out stock options whose exercise price exceeds the fair market value of our common stock, often referred to as underwater options, for cash. 
• No Liberal Recycling of Shares. All of the Company's active equity plans prohibit the liberal recycling of shares or underlying awards granted under these plans.  
• No Automatic Single Trigger Vesting of Awards. None of the Company's active equity plans provide for automatic acceleration of equity awards upon a change in control of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Philosophy
Goal of Executive Compensation Program 
The primary objective of our executive compensation program is to attract and retain a passionate team of executives who will provide leadership to make surgery more effective, less invasive, and easier on surgeons, patients, and their families. We seek to accomplish this goal in a way that is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.
We employ a "team-based" approach to compensating our executive officers, which is predicated on two principles.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive officer must demonstrate exceptional individual performance to remain a part of our executive team. We believe that executive officers who underperform should be removed from our executive team and have their compensation adjusted accordingly, or be dismissed from the Company. 
• Each executive officer must contribute as a member of the team to our overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within his or her area of responsibility. 
[END TABLE]
As a result of this team-based approach, the Compensation Committee carefully considers the relative compensation levels among all members of the executive team. Accordingly, our executive compensation program is designed to be internally consistent and equitable to further the Company's success. As reflected in the discussion below, the differences in the amounts awarded to each of our executive officers, including our NEOs, relate primarily to the experience, responsibilities, and performance of each individual executive officer, and differing market practices for compensation in each executive officer's function.
Compensation Mix
Historically, our equity program provides awards in both stock options and RSUs. We relied on these long-term equity awards to attract, motivate, and retain an outstanding executive team and to ensure a strong connection between our executive compensation program and the long-term interests of our stockholders. We believe stock options are an effective compensation element for attracting innovative and passionate executive officers that rewards stockholder value creation. By ensuring that our executive officers have a significant portion of their potential compensation tied to long-term stock price performance, we are able to closely align the interest of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders.
In 2018, the majority of Dr. Guthart's and the other NEOs' total compensation is long-term equity based compensation. By linking more of our NEOs total compensation to long-term equity emphasizes variable pay, which is consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.

Executive Compensation Process
Role of Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program (including our executive compensation policies and practices), approves the compensation of our executive officers including our NEOs (other than Dr. Guthart), and administers our various equity plans. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of Dr. Guthart to determine whether to make any changes to his compensation. Following its approval, the Compensation Committee presents such changes to the independent members of our Board for review and ratification.
Role of Executive Officers
Dr. Guthart makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the salary, annual cash bonus award, and equity awards for the executive officers other than himself. At the Compensation Committee's request, Dr. Guthart reviews with the Compensation Committee the individual performance of each of the other executive officers, including each of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee gives considerable weight to Dr. Guthart's evaluations and determines whether the recommended changes in each executive officer's compensation, if any, are appropriate.
The Compensation Committee receives support from our Human Resources Department in designing our executive compensation program and analyzing competitive market practices. In addition, Dr. Guthart participates in Compensation Committee meetings, providing input from our executive team on organizational structure, executive development, and financial analysis. 
Role of Compensation Consultant
In 2018, the Compensation Committee directly retained the services of Compensia, an independent national executive compensation consulting firm, to assist it in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. Compensia does not provide services to Intuitive management outside of the services provided to the Compensation Committee unless directed by the Compensation Committee.
The Committee annually reviews the performance of Compensia. As part of the annual review, the Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules and has concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the work that Compensia performs for the Compensation Committee. 
Competitive Positioning
While the Compensation Committee does not establish compensation levels based solely on a review of competitive market data, it believes that such data is a useful tool in its deliberations as it recognizes that our compensation policies and practices must be competitive in the marketplace for us to be able to attract, motivate, and retain qualified executive officers. Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews our executive compensation relative to our established competitive market (based on an analysis of the compensation policies and practices of a select group of peer companies) every two years. The Compensation Committee uses the competitive market data when evaluating all aspects of executive compensation. As a reference point for our NEOs, we use the market median for cash and incentive values, the 75th percentile for long term incentive values, and the market median and 75th percentile for the total direct compensation values.
 The Compensation Committee engages Compensia to assist with updating our compensation peer group and assessing the competitiveness of our executive compensation program. In evaluating and making changes to the compensation peer group, the Compensation Committee considered the following selection criteria: (1) location of the company (U.S.-based); (2) ownership structure of the company (publicly-traded); (3) company's industry (medical device, medical supplies, life sciences tools and services and technology); (4) revenues (approximately 1/3 to 3x the Company's last four quarters' revenue); and (5) market capitalization (approximately 1/3 to 3x the Company's market capitalization).

After considering the analysis performed by Compensia, the Compensation Committee selected the following direct compensation peer group for use in 2018:

Annual Performance-Based Cash Bonuses
We use annual cash bonuses to motivate and reward our executive officers, including our NEOs, to achieve or exceed our short-term financial and operational objectives while making progress towards our longer-term growth and other goals. Consistent with our executive compensation philosophy, these annual cash bonuses constitute a smaller portion of the target total direct compensation opportunity of our executive officers than their long-term equity awards.
At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee determines the amount of the award to be paid to each executive officer by comparing actual results to the performance goals for the year. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or increase the amount of any individual award based on an executive officer's overall performance and his or her contribution to the achievement of our performance goals.
Target Annual Cash Bonus Opportunities
Given our emphasis on long-term stockholder value creation over annual operating results, the CIP targets are set relatively low to the competitive market, as reflected by the target annual cash bonus opportunities of our executive officers. For 2018, the target and maximum annual cash bonuses opportunities as a percentage of base salary under the CIP for our NEOs were set as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Named Executive Officer   Target Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity (as a percentage of base salary)  Maximum Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) (1)
Named Executive Officer   Target Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity (as a percentage of base salary)  Maximum Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) (1)
Gary S. Guthart, Ph.D.   100.0%   125.0% 
Salvatore J. Brogna   70.0%   87.5% 
Myriam J. Curet, M.D.   70.0%   87.5% 
Marshall L. Mohr   70.0%   87.5% 
David J. Rosa   70.0%   87.5% 
(1) The maximum annual cash bonus opportunity (as a percentage of base salary) is calculated at 125% of the target; however, the Compensation Committee may award higher amounts based on individual performance. 
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Bonus Plan Formula and Funding
For 2018, the CIP was funded through an incentive pool based on our achievement of an adjusted operating income ("AOI") goal as set forth in our annual operating plan, and paid to our executive officers based on our actual level of achievement of AOI and several pre-established corporate performance objectives (the "Company Performance Goals"). For purposes of the CIP, "AOI" is defined as operating income excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization of intangible assets, and litigation charges.
For 2018, the CIP incentive pool was funded based on an AOI target set at the previous year's AOI level plus a pre-established increase in AOI for the year and could be funded up to a maximum of 125% of target. The amount of the incentive pool that is paid out as annual cash bonuses for each executive officer, including each NEO, is determined by an equal weighting of achievement of the AOI goal and Company Performance Goals. In the event that the AOI target was not achieved, the incentive pool would not be funded, and our NEOs would not be eligible to receive any bonus under the CIP. Typically, the overall CIP payout will not exceed the amount by which the incentive pool is funded.
The Company Performance Goals are established at the corporate level by the executive team and Dr. Guthart, then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors annually at the beginning of the fiscal year. For 2018, the Performance Goals fell into four categories: Business Metrics, Regional Strategic Goals, Strategic Operations/Quality Goals and Corporate Strategy. Given their relationship to our annual operating plan and business strategy and because the Company Performance Goals and their specific target levels are highly confidential, we do not publicly disclose them. We believe their disclosure would provide our competitors, customers and other third parties with significant insights regarding our confidential business strategies that could cause us substantial competitive harm.
The Company Performance Goals are designed to focus on the short-term objectives that we believe ultimately drive the long-term success of the Company. There is a risk that payments with respect to any specific goal will not be made at all or will be made at less than 100% of the target level. The achievement of the goals may be affected by several factors including, but not limited to, the impact of changes in healthcare legislation and policy, global and regional conditions, credit markets and the related impact on healthcare spending, timing and success of product development and market acceptance of developed products, changes in trade agreements and/or tariffs imposed on cross-border commerce, and regulatory approvals, clearances, and restrictions. Because several of these factors are not entirely within the control of our NEOs and given the "stretch" nature of the goal-setting process, we believe that 
Table of Contents it would be relatively difficult to fully achieve the Company Performance Goals in any year. The challenge of the goals and uncertainty in the environment ensures that any payments under the CIP are truly performance-based, which is consistent with the plan's objectives.
2018 Bonus Decisions
For 2018, target funding was set at AOI of $1,449 million and maximum funding of 125% of the pool was set at AOI of $1,811 million, with funding at intermediate levels determined based on linear interpolation. Based on our actual achievement of AOI of $1,598 million or 116.3% achievement, weighted at 50% and actual achievement of Company Performance Goals of 100.0%, weighted at 50%, the CIP was funded at 108.2% of the target level for our NEOs.
The annual cash bonus payments made to our NEOs for 2018 are set forth in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Long-Term Equity Awards
Our long-term incentive compensation consists of equity awards in the form of stock options and RSUs. We grant these equity awards to ensure that our executive officers, including our NEOs, have a continuing stake in our long-term success. The Compensation Committee believes that these types of equity awards best meet our overall goals of alignment with long-term performance and stockholder value creation, and retention of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee also believes granting awards with multi-year vesting requirements and, with respect to options, a 10-year term creates a substantial retention incentive and encourages our executive officers to focus on our long-term business objectives and long-term stock price performance.
Individual grant awards are determined using various factors including competitive market data, current value of our common stock, overall available stock pool and the individual performance of each NEO. The Compensation Committee considers Dr. Guthart's recommendations for other NEOs when approving equity awards. The Compensation Committee determines and presents its recommendation for Dr. Guthart to the Board of Directors for their approval.
The equity awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 are set forth in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below.

(1) As described above, stock options are granted bi-annually in February and August. Although the number of options to be granted in August 2019 will be determined at a future date, we anticipate that a like number to the February 2019 award will be granted. We have included both the February 2019 grant and the estimated August 2019 grant in this table. Please refer to the section "Equity Award Grant Policies" for more information on the vesting terms of these awards. For 2019, 2018, and 2017, we targeted the stock option to RSU grant ratio at approximately 3:1 for our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
The equity awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 are set forth in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below.
Equity Award Grant Policies
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves annual equity award grants to our executive officers, including our NEOs. Stock options are granted to our executive officers, bi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. RSUs are granted on February 15 of each year. The February stock option grants vest over a four-year period, while the August stock option grants vest over a 3.5-year period. The RSUs vest 25% annually over a four-year period.
We do not time the granting of stock options with any favorable or unfavorable news released by the Company. Initial stock option grants are consistently granted on the fifth business day of the month after employment begins. Proximity of any awards to an earnings announcement or other market events is coincidental.

Welfare and Other Employee Benefits
We have established a tax-qualified Section 401(k) retirement plan for all employees, including our NEOs, who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. Beginning in 2015, we began matching contributions made to the plan by our eligible employees, including executive officers. We match 200% of employee contributions up to $1,500 per calendar year per person. All matching employer contributions are fully vested when made.
In addition, we provide all of our employees who work 30 hours or more per week, including our NEOs, a variety of health and welfare benefits. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision benefits, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and basic life insurance coverage.
Our employee benefits programs are intended to be affordable and competitive in relation to the market. We adjust our employee benefits programs as needed based upon regular monitoring of applicable laws and practices and the competitive market. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits
Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, we do not provide perquisites to our executive officers, including our NEOs, except in limited situations where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective, and for recruitment and retention purposes.
In the future, we may provide perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual executive officer in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective, and for recruitment, motivation, or retention purposes. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation Committee.
Post-Employment Compensation 
In December 2008, our Board approved and adopted a change in control plan (the "Change in Control Plan"). Under the Change in Control Plan, all eligible employees of the Company who have been employed at least six months prior to the date of their separation from service, including our executive officers, are eligible to receive certain payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment without cause or an involuntary separation from service within 12 months after a change in control of the Company. 
We believe the Change in Control Plan is beneficial to our stockholders because it minimizes the uncertainty presented to our valuable workforce in the case of a change in control of the Company. In addition, we provide the Change in Control Plan to encourage our employees to work at a dynamic and rapidly growing business where their long-term compensation largely depends on future stock price appreciation. In the case of our executive officers, the Change in Control Plan is intended to mitigate a potential disincentive for them when they are evaluating a potential acquisition of the Company, particularly when the services of the executive officers may not be required by the acquiring entity. In such a situation, we believe that these protections are necessary to encourage retention of the executive officers through the conclusion of the transaction, and to ensure a smooth management transition. The payments and benefits provided under the Change in Control Plan have been designed to provide our eligible employees, including our executive officers, with consistent treatment that is competitive with current market practices. 
A description of the terms and conditions of the Change in Control Plan, as well as information about the estimated payments and benefits that our NEOs would have been eligible to receive as of December 31, 2018, are set forth in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below.

Other Compensation Policies
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We believe that stock ownership by our executive officers, including our NEOs, and the members of our Board is important to link the risks and rewards inherent in stock ownership of these individuals and our stockholders. In January 2015, our Board adopted executive officer stock ownership guidelines requiring each individual serving as an executive officer to maintain beneficial ownership of a minimum dollar amount of shares of our common stock. For the purposes of determining stock ownership levels, the following forms of equity interests are included: shares owned outright by, or held in trust for the benefit of, the executive officer or his or her spouse or children sharing the same household; shares held through a fund or other entity as to which the executive officer has control; shares of our common stock, stock units or other stock equivalents obtained through the exercise of stock options or vesting of equity awards; shares of common stock underlying vested stock options net of shares that would need to be withheld for the exercise price; and other stock or stock equivalent awards determined by the Compensation Committee. 
These stock ownership guidelines are intended to create a clear standard that encourages these executive officers to remain invested in the performance of our stock price. Each executive officer has five years from the date he or she becomes subject to the stock ownership guidelines to achieve compliance with the guidelines. The current ownership levels specified by these guidelines require each NEO to maintain a minimum level of stock ownership equal to four times his or her annual base salary. All of our NEOs met the guidelines or were on track to comply with the guidelines in the relevant time frame as of the date of this proxy statement.
Compensation Recovery Policy
Currently, we have not implemented a policy regarding retroactive adjustments to any cash or equity-based incentive compensation paid to our executive officers and other employees where the payments were predicated upon the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a financial restatement.
Derivatives Trading, Hedging, and Pledging Policies
Our Insider Trading Policy provides that no employee, officer, or director may acquire, sell, or trade in any interest or position relating to the future price of Company securities, such as a put option, a call option or a short sale (including a short sale "against the box"), or engage in hedging transactions (including "cashless collars"). In addition, our Insider Trading Policy provides that no employee, officer, or director may pledge Company securities as collateral to secure loans. This prohibition means, among other things, that these individuals may not hold Company securities in a "margin" account, which would allow the individual to borrow against their holdings to buy securities.

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation for individual compensation exceeding $1 million in any taxable year for "covered employees." As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, covered employees generally consist of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and each of the next three highest compensated officers for the taxable year without regard to whether such executive officers are serving at the end of the taxable year, and anyone who previously has been a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. In addition, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption from this $1 million deduction limit was, with certain limited exceptions, eliminated.
The Compensation Committee believes that, in establishing the cash and equity incentive compensation plans and arrangements for our executive officers, the potential deductibility of the compensation payable under those plans and arrangements should be only one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration, and not the sole governing factor. For that reason, the Compensation Committee may deem it appropriate to provide one or more executive officer with the opportunity to earn incentive compensation, whether through cash incentive awards tied to our financial performance or equity incentive awards tied to the executive officer's continued service, which may be in excess of the amount deductible by reason of Section 162(m) or other provisions of the Code. 
 The Compensation Committee believes it is important to maintain cash and equity incentive compensation at the requisite level to attract and retain the individuals essential to our financial success, even if all or part of that compensation may not be deductible by reason of the Section 162(m) limitation.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The Compensation Committee takes into account whether components of the compensation for our executive officers will be adversely impacted by the penalty tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code, and aims to structure these components to be compliant with or exempt from Section 409A to avoid such potential adverse tax consequences.
"Golden Parachute" Payments
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code provide that certain executive officers and other service providers who are highly compensated or hold significant equity interests may be subject to an excise tax if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of the company that exceeds certain prescribed limits, and that we, or a successor, may forfeit a deduction on the amounts subject to this additional tax. We did not provide any executive officer, including any NEO, with a "gross-up" or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability that he or she might owe as a result of the application of Sections 280G or 4999 during 2018 and we have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any executive officer, including any NEO with such a "gross-up" or other reimbursement.
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation
We follow ASC 718 for our share-based compensation awards. ASC 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and RSUs, based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their share-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.
COMPENSATION RISK CONSIDERATIONS
The Compensation Committee considers, in establishing and reviewing our employee compensation programs, whether each of these programs encourages unnecessary or excessive risk taking. The Company, after reviewing and discussing the compensation programs with the Compensation and Audit Committees of our Board, believes that the programs are balanced and do not motivate or encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking because of, in part, the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salaries are fixed in amount and thus do not encourage risk taking. 
• While annual performance-based awards focus on achievement of short-term goals, and short-term goals may encourage the taking of short-term risks at the expense of long-term results, the Company's performance-based award programs represent a reasonable portion of employees' target total direct compensation opportunities. Performance-based awards are based on various departmental and Company-wide metrics; funding for the awards is capped at the Company level and the distribution of the funds to executive officers and other employees is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
• Long-term equity awards are important to help further align employees' interests with those of our stockholders. The ultimate value of the awards is tied to the Company's stock price and since awards are staggered and subject to long-term vesting schedules, they help ensure that our executive officers have significant value tied to our long-term stock price performance. As described above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we have established procedures related to the timing and approval of equity awards. 
[END TABLE]
Because of the above, we believe that our employee compensation programs appropriately balance risk and the desire to focus employees on specific short-term goals important to the Company's success.

(1) For 2018, Dr. Guthart had a bonus target of 100% of base salary and Messrs. Brogna, Rosa, and Mohr as well as Dr. Curet had a bonus target of 70% of base salary. At its discretion, the Compensation Committee has the authority to pay any NEO in excess of or below his or her targeted bonus amount. The goals for 2018 were approved by the Compensation Committee in January 2018. The payout amounts for each NEO were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board in January 2019 upon reviewing results for 2018. The maximum bonus or performance payout is calculated at 125% of the target. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section above for detailed discussion of the CIP. 
(2) The options were granted under our Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan. The February 15 option grants vest 6/48 at the end of six months and 1/48 per month thereafter through a four-year period, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The August 15 option grants vest 7/48 at the end of one month and 1/48 per month thereafter through a 3.5-year period, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. The February 15 RSU grants vest 1/4 increments annually over a four-year period, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. 
(3) The amounts shown represent the fair value per share as of the grant date of such award determined pursuant to stock compensation accounting, multiplied by the number of shares.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table shows potential payments to the NEOs upon a change in control of the Company and subsequent involuntary separation from service within 12 months after the change in control, in accordance with the Change in Control Plan. Under this plan, all eligible employees of the Company who have been employed at least six months prior to the separation from service date, including executive officers, are entitled to the following severance payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment without cause or an involuntary separation from service within 12 months after a change in control of the Company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum cash payment in the amount equal to the sum of six months of such eligible employee's base compensation (defined in the Change in Control Plan as base salary and target bonus) plus an additional one month of base compensation for every year of such eligible employee's service with the Company, such severance not to exceed 12 months; 
• six months of COBRA premiums, provided that such eligible employee elects continued coverage under COBRA; and 
• 100% vesting of all outstanding unvested equity awards that the eligible employee then holds. 
[END TABLE]
 The amounts shown assume that a qualifying termination of employment was effective December 31, 2018, the last business day of the year, under the Change in Control Plan and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to the NEOs upon such a termination of employment. The terms and conditions of the Change in Control Plan (including the definitions of the key plan terms) are set forth in the plan document.

(2) Amounts shown assume that all stock options would be exercised immediately upon termination of employment. Stock option values represent the excess of the market value of the option shares for which vesting is accelerated over the exercise price for those option shares, using $478.92 per share for the market value, which is the closing market price of a share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of our 2018 fiscal year. The dollar amounts of RSUs are determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to the RSUs for which vesting is accelerated by $478.92. 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the Change in Control Plan, an involuntary separation from service of a NEO generally means, (i) without the executive's express written consent, the assignment to the executive of any duties or the significant reduction of the executive's duties, authority or responsibilities, which is inconsistent with the executive's duties, authority or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such assignment, or the removal of the executive from such duties, authority or responsibilities; (ii) a reduction by the Company in the base compensation of the executive as in effect immediately prior to such reduction; (iii) a material reduction by the Company in the kind or level of employee benefits to which the executive is entitled immediately prior to such reduction with the result that the executive's overall benefits package is significantly reduced; (iv) the relocation of the executive to a facility or a location more than 25 miles from the executive's then present location, without the executive's express written consent; (v) any purported termination of the executive by the Company which is not effected for disability or for cause, or any purported termination for which the grounds relied upon are not valid; (vi) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of the agreement by any successors contemplated in the Change in Control Plan; or (vii) any act or set of facts or circumstances which would, under California case law or statute constitute a constructive termination of the executive. In order for an executive to terminate employment in an involuntary separation from service, he or she must provide notice to the Company of the existence of a condition listed above, within 30 days of the initial existence of the condition, and the Company shall have 30 days following receipt of such notice to remedy such condition and not make any payments hereunder in connection with such termination of employment.
The payments and benefits pursuant to the Change in Control Plan are subject to a NEO's timely execution and non-revocation of a release of claims. Further, the Change in Control Plan specifically include a so-called parachute payment "best pay" provision, where payments and benefits will either be made to the executive in full or as to such 
Table of Contents lesser amount as which would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax basis.

Annual total compensation of the CEO for 2018   $ 6,423,078   
Annual total compensation of the median employee for 2018   $ 163,552   
Ratio of annual total compensation of the CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee for 2018   39.3:1   
[END TABLE]
The Company believes that there have been no significant changes to its employee population or employee compensation arrangements during 2018. The median employee for 2018 is the same as 2017. In determining the median employee, the Company chose December 31, 2017 as the date for establishing the employee population used in identifying the median employee and used fiscal 2017 as the measurement period. The Company identified the median employee using a consistently applied compensation measure that consists of annual base salary or wages, target annual performance-based cash bonuses, target commissions, and long-term equity awards based on their grant date fair values. Permanent employees who joined in 2017 and permanent employees who were on leave during 2017 were assumed to have worked for the entire year. All U.S. and non-U.S. employees employed as of December 31, 2017, were captured. No cost-of-living adjustments were made. 
The annual total compensation of the CEO and the annual total compensation of the median employee were calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The Board has determined that the following directors are "independent" under current Nasdaq rules: Craig H. Barratt, Ph.D., Michael A. Friedman, M.D., Amal M. Johnson, Don R. Kania, Ph.D., Keith R. Leonard, Jr., Alan J. Levy, Ph.D., Jami Dover Nachtsheim, Mark J. Rubash, and Lonnie M. Smith.
The Company has adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between the Company and its related parties, such as directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than five percent beneficial owners, and each of their respective immediate family members, as well as any firm, corporation or other entity in which such persons are employed, serve as general partner, principal or similar position or in which such persons own a five percent or greater beneficial ownership interest, where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in a single calendar year. The policy provides that the Audit Committee review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, they take into account:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party. 
• Whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the related party transaction. 
• Whether the transaction would impair the independence of an outside director. 
• Whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer of the Company. 
• Any other factors deemed appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
No member of the Audit Committee may participate in the approval of a related party transaction for which he or she is a related party.
In addition, each of the following types of related party transactions are deemed to be approved under the policy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation to an executive officer or director of the Company required to be disclosed in the Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K; or compensation to an executive officer who is not an immediate family member of a related party, provided that such compensation would have been reported pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K as compensation earned for services to the Company if the executive was a "named executive officer", and such compensation has been approved, or recommended to the Board for approval, by the Compensation Committee of the Board. 
• The following transactions that are in the Company's ordinary course of business and where the financial interest of the related party arises only in the following indirect manners: 
a) from the related party's position as a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction;  
b) from the direct or indirect ownership by the related party (or parties, in the aggregate) of less than a 10% equity interest in another person (other than a partnership) which is a party to the transaction; or c) from the related party's position as a limited partner in a partnership in which the related party (or parties, in the aggregate) has or have an interest of less than 10%, and the related party is not a general partner of and does not have another position in the partnership. 
• Transactions that are in the Company's ordinary course of business and where the interest of the related party arises solely from the ownership of a class of equity securities in the Company and all holders of such class of equity securities of the Company will receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis. 
[END TABLE]
A summary of all material related party transactions, if any, is provided to the Audit Committee for its review at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. If advance approval of a related party transaction is not feasible, then the transaction may be preliminarily entered into by management upon prior approval by the Chair of the Audit Committee and will be subject to ratification by the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
On August 8, 2017, in connection with the proposed settlement (the "Settlement") of purported stockholders' derivative lawsuits entitled Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago, In re Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation and City of Plantation Police Officers' Employees' Retirement System and the other similar stockholder derivative lawsuits (collectively, the "Derivative Litigation"), the Board agreed to pay $15.0 million to the Company, comprised of a cash payment of $5.0 million, which was partly covered by existing insurance, and the return to the Company of Intuitive stock options such that the number of shares subject to the options returned multiplied by the market price of the underlying shares as of the close of trading on September 15, 2016 (the date the Settling Parties executed the Memorandum of Understanding relating to the Settlement) equaled $10.0 million. Adjusted 
Table of Contents to reflect the three-for-one stock split the Company effected in October 2017, the price of a share of Intuitive stock as of the close of trading on September 15, 2016, was $228.06, and the aggregate number of shares subject to the options cancelled was 43,848. Based on the price per share of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2018, the date when the options were cancelled, the difference between the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the cancelled options and the exercise price of such options was $11.0 million. The Settlement provided for a dismissal with prejudice and release of all claims brought in the Derivative Litigation, and also included terms that required the Company to reimburse the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater-than-10% beneficial owners are required to furnish us with copies of all of these forms which they file.  
Based solely on our review of these reports or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during 2018, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, greater-than-10% beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were met.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table contains information as of December 31, 2018, for two categories of equity compensation plans:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Plan Category   Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, awards, and rights (a)   Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and awards (2)   Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a))
Plan Category   Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, awards, and rights (a)   Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and awards (2)   Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a))
Equity compensation plans approved by security holders   5,398,420     $ 203.84     5,670,804   
Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders (1)   765,282     $ 179.28     102,228   
Total   6,163,702     $ 200.79     5,773,032   
(1) Represents options under the Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan, adopted by the Board in October 2009 and first used in fiscal 2010. Options are granted at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and have a term not to exceed ten years. 
(2) The weighted average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding options and does not reflect the shares that will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding awards of RSUs, which have no exercise price. 
[END TABLE]
Material Features of the Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan
In October 2009, the Board adopted our Amended and Restated 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, pursuant to Rule 5653(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Global Market, which was subsequently amended by the Board in February 2011, July 2011, February 2012, July 2012, January 2013, May 2013, December 2013, and April 2015. 
Awards granted under the 2009 Plan are intended to constitute "employment inducement awards" under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and therefore, the 2009 Plan is intended to be exempt from the Nasdaq Listing Rules regarding stockholder approval of stock option and stock purchase plans. A total of 4,365,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, dividend equivalents, or stock appreciation rights. These awards may be granted to individuals who are then new employees, or are commencing employment with us or one of our subsidiaries following a bona fide period of non-employment with us, and for whom such awards are granted as a material inducement to commencing employment with us or one of our subsidiaries. 
The 2009 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee or another committee of the Board. The plan administrator has broad discretion to take action under the 2009 Plan, as well as make adjustments to the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, in the event of certain transactions and events affecting our common stock, including a change in control, stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, and other corporate transactions. In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with our stockholders known as "equity restructurings," the plan administrator will make equitable adjustments to the 2009 Plan and outstanding awards.
The Board may amend, suspend, or terminate the 2009 Plan at any time, provided that no such action may impair any rights under any outstanding awards without the consent of the participant.

The Audit Committee's pre-approval policy provides for the pre-approval of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services specifically described by the committee on an annual basis, and unless a type of service is pre-approved under the policy, it will require separate pre-approval by the committee if it is to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The policy authorizes the committee to delegate to one or more of its members pre-approval authority with respect to permitted services.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following audit committee report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under these acts, except to the extent we specifically incorporate by reference into such filings.
Our Audit Committee is composed of "independent" directors, as determined in accordance with the Nasdaq Stock Market's Rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee has certain duties and powers as described in its written charter adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board"). A copy of the charter can be found on the Company's website at www.intuitive.com.
As described more fully in its charter, the purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board with its oversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of our Company's financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, assessing the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, and the performance of the persons performing the internal audit duties for our Company and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Company has a full-time Internal Audit department that reports to the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit department is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of the Company's internal controls related to, for example, the reliability and integrity of the Company's financial reporting process and the safeguarding of the Company's assets. Management is responsible for preparation, presentation, and integrity of our financial statements as well as our financial reporting process, accounting policies, internal audit function, internal accounting controls, and disclosure controls and procedures. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. The following is the Audit Committee's report submitted to the Board for 2018.
The Audit Committee has:

OVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS
This Proxy Statement contains FIVE proposals requiring stockholder action. Proposal No. 1 requests the election of nine directors to the Board. Proposal No. 2 requests an advisory approval of the compensation of our NEOs. Proposal No. 3 requests the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. Proposal No. 4 requests the approval of the amendment and restatement of the 2010 Incentive Award Plan. We expect Proposal No. 5 to be presented by a stockholder at the Annual Meeting. Each of the proposals is discussed in more detail in the pages that follow.
Table of Contents
PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors (the "Board") has ten authorized seats. Immediately prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), the authorized size of the Board will be reduced to nine. 
Craig H. Barratt, Ph.D., Gary S. Guthart, Ph.D., Amal M. Johnson, Don R. Kania, Ph.D., Keith R. Leonard, Jr., Alan J. Levy, Ph.D., Jami Dover Nachtsheim, Mark J. Rubash, and Lonnie M. Smith have been nominated by the Board for election at the Annual Meeting to serve a one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until a successor has been duly elected and qualified. Please refer to "Directors and Corporate Governance" section above for the nominees' biographies.
The Company's Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of directors. As such, in an election where the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director will be elected to the Board if the number of shares voted for the nominee exceeds the number of shares voted against the nominee. The majority voting standard would not apply, however, if the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In that case, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting would be elected.
The majority voting standard will apply to the election taking place at the Annual Meeting. Consequently, in order to be elected, a nominee must receive more "for" votes than "against" votes. Proxies may not be voted for more than the nine nominees, and stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. In the event any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for the nominee, if any, who may be designated by the Board to fill the vacancy.
Shares represented by the accompanying proxy will be voted for the election of the nominees recommended by the Board unless the proxy is marked in such a manner so as to withhold authority to vote. In the event that any nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as management may propose. Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected, and the Board has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve.
Vote Required
A majority of the votes cast is required to elect each of the director nominees. This means that to be elected a nominee must receive more "for" votes than "against" votes. 
Recommendation of the Board
[BEGIN TABLE]
  The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the election of Craig H. Barratt, Ph.D., Gary S. Guthart, Ph.D., Amal M. Johnson, Don R. Kania, Ph.D., Keith R. Leonard, Jr., Alan J. Levy, Ph.D., Jami Dover Nachtsheim, Mark J. Rubash, and Lonnie M. Smith.

PROPOSAL NO. 2
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The primary objective of our executive compensation program is to attract and retain a passionate team of executives who will provide leadership to make surgery more effective, less invasive, and easier on surgeons, patients, and their families. The Company accomplishes this goal in a manner consistent with its strategy, competitive practice, sound corporate governance principles, and stockholder interests and concerns. The Company believes the compensation program for the Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of its stockholders and was instrumental in helping the Company achieve its financial performance in 2018.
At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved the compensation of our NEOs, with over 95% of the votes cast voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee continues to apply the same principles and philosophy it has used in previous years in determining executive compensation. It will continue to consider stockholder concerns and feedback in the future. The Compensation Committee is continuously working to ensure that management's interests are aligned with our stockholders' interests to support long-term value creation and will continue to consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs. See the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" ("CD&A") section above for a more detailed discussion.
Stockholders are urged to read the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement, including the CD&A section which discusses the Company's compensation policies and practices, and the 2018 compensation for the Company's NEOs. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors (the "Board") believe that the Company's compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving the Company's goals and are consistent with stockholder interests.
The Company has determined to hold a separate stockholder vote on the compensation of our NEOs every year. Therefore, as a matter of good corporate governance and in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are including in this Proxy Statement a separate stockholder vote on the approval of the NEOs' compensation, which vote is non-binding. Accordingly, we are asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as described in the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement, including the CD&A section and the related compensation tables and other narrative executive compensation disclosure contained therein.
The following resolution will be submitted for a stockholder vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Intuitive Surgical approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Intuitive Surgical's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion of this Proxy Statement."
Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the results of the vote. The Compensation Committee will consider our stockholders' concerns to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEOs' compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement and take them into account in future determinations concerning our executive compensation program. Unless the Compensation Committee or the Board modifies the Company's determination in the frequency of future advisory stockholder votes on the compensation of the NEOs, the next advisory board vote will be held at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The Board therefore recommends that you indicate your support for the Company's compensation policies and practices as reflected in the compensation of the NEOs, as outlined above.
Recommendation of the Board
[BEGIN TABLE]
  The Board recommends that stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, FOR the approval of the NEOs' compensation described in the CD&A, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion of this Proxy Statement.

The Company's independent registered public accounting firm and its auditors for the year ended December 31, 2018, were PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"). At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), the stockholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the event of a negative vote on such ratification, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and available to respond to appropriate questions.
Vote Required
Approval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
Recommendation of the Board

PROPOSAL NO. 4
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC. 
2010 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
General 
We are asking you to approve the amendment and restatement to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. 2010 Incentive Award Plan (the "Amended 2010 Plan"), which (i) increases the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Intuitive Surgical, Inc. 2010 Incentive Award Plan, as previously amended and restated effective February 2, 2017 (the "2010 Plan"), by 4,000,000 shares from 24,450,000 shares, thereby increasing the total number of shares reserved for issuance to 28,450,000 and (ii) extends the term of the Amended 2010 Plan to 2029. The Board of Directors (the "Board") has unanimously adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the Amended 2010 Plan for employees and other service providers of the Company and its subsidiaries. Per the requirements set forth in the 2010 Plan, the Amended 2010 Plan will become effective if approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and entitled to vote on the proposal. If the Amended 2010 Plan is not approved by our stockholders, it will not become effective, the 2010 Plan will continue in effect, and we may continue to grant awards under the 2010 Plan, subject to its terms, conditions and limitations, using the shares available for issuance thereunder.
Introduction 
We designed the 2010 Plan with the intent to conform to best practices in equity compensation plans. The 2010 Plan was initially approved by shareholders on April 21, 2010, and replaced our previously expiring 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2010 Plan adopted many features designed to address stockholders concerns related to equity incentive plans such as prohibiting repricing, eliminating "evergreen" share replenishment features, granting only non-discounted options, and disallowing transfer of options to third parties. In the years following its adoption, the 2010 Plan has been amended and restated, most recently in 2017, among other things, to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance.
To continue to align the long-term interests of our employees with those of our stockholders, and attract and retain the highest quality of talent in a highly competitive labor market, we have determined to amend and restate the 2010 Plan to further increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by 4,000,000 shares. Our request is approximately 3.5% of the total shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. The Compensation Committee and the Board have approved and are asking you to approve the Amended 2010 Plan. Non-approval of the Amended 2010 Plan may compel the Company to increase the cash component of employee compensation because the Company would need to replace components of compensation previously delivered in equity awards. 
The Company believes that long-term equity awards are an extremely important way to attract and retain a passionate executive team and align the executives' interests with the Company's stockholders. Over the past several years, the Company's investment in the expansion of robotic surgery, including development of da Vinci Surgical Systems, development of surgical instruments and accessories, regulatory approval and compliance, expanding surgical applications, training surgeons and surgical teams and otherwise expanding the market for our products, has resulted in exceptional growth in the Company's revenue and earnings. Over the period from 2008 through 2018, the Company's annual revenue(*) grew from $875 million to $3.7 billion; net income(*) grew from $204 million to $1.1 billion, while the Company's cash and investments grew from $902 million at December 31, 2008 to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018. From March 2009 through December 31, 2018, the Company has also repurchased 34.7 million shares of its outstanding common stock. The Company's success has also resulted in a significant increase in stockholder value as the Company's market capitalization grew from $5.0 billion at December 31, 2008 to $54.8 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of approximately 997%. 
The Board believes the Company's success is due to its highly talented employee base and that future success depends on the ability to attract and retain high-caliber employees. The Company's engineering operations are primarily located in Silicon Valley, where it must compete with many technology companies, including high profile start-ups, for a limited pool of talented people. We also compete with other large medical device companies for a limited pool of exceptional sales and service personnel globally. The ability to grant equity awards is a necessary and powerful recruiting and retention tool for the Company to obtain the high-quality employees it needs. 
Table of Contents
The 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan and the 2010 Plan are our only active employee equity plans (other than our 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan). The 2009 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan can be used to make grants to newly hired employees of the Company; however, the Company intends to no longer issue grants from the New Hire Plan in the future and plans to instead utilize the 2010 Plan to make grants to new employees. As of February 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee anticipates that the 4,000,000 shares requested under the Amended 2010 Plan, plus 2,374,642 shares available for issuance under the 2010 Plan prior to the amendment and restatement will enable the Company to fund its equity compensation program for employees through the date of our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, accommodating anticipated grants relating to the hiring, retention and promotion of employees. 
The Compensation Committee (which administers our equity plans) recognizes its responsibility to strike a balance between stockholder concerns regarding the potential dilutive effect of equity awards and the ability to attract, retain and reward employees whose contributions are critical to the long-term success of the Company. The Company stresses a team approach and environment, believes that all employees should be driving a common set of goals and believes that our employees' interests should be aligned with the interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, all U.S. employees and nearly all non-U.S. employees are granted long-term equity awards. 
Burn Rate and Overhang 
In administering our equity program, we consider both our "burn rate" and our "overhang." We define "burn rate" as the number of equity awards granted in the year, net of cancellations, divided by the sum of the undiluted weighted average shares of our common stock outstanding during the year plus the number of options and RSUs that have been issued and are outstanding. The "burn rate" measures the potential dilutive effect of our annual equity grants. We granted 569,022 stock options and 774,118 RSUs in 2018 and 106,677 stock options and 104,483 RSUs were forfeited or canceled in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the number of weighted average shares outstanding was 113,664,063, and the total number of stock options and RSUs outstanding was 6,163,702 and 2,034,510 respectively. For fiscal 2018, our burn rate was 0.9%. Our three-year average burn rate from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018 was 1.2%. 
We define "overhang" as the equity awards outstanding but not exercised, plus equity awards available to be granted (the "available equity award shares"), divided by the total shares of common stock outstanding plus the available equity award shares. The overhang measures the potential dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards and future awards available for grant. 
The following table shows the details of equity awards available for grant as of February 19, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, including overhang calculations, and assumes stockholders approve the Amended 2010 Plan:

• The Amended 2010 Plan has a ten-year term expiring 2029.  
• The Amended 2010 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards, dividend equivalents, performance bonus awards and other performance-based awards to eligible individuals. 
• 24,450,000 shares of common stock were previously authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2010 Plan and we are proposing to increase the number of shares under the Amended 2010 Plan by 4,000,000.

[END TABLE]
The Amended 2010 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board or one or more of our officers the authority to grant or amend awards to participants other than our senior executives who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Compensation Committee will consist solely of two or more members of the Board, each of whom is a "non-employee director" as defined by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and an "independent director" under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other principal securities market on which shares of our common stock are traded).
The Compensation Committee has general authority to administer the Amended 2010 Plan, including the power to determine eligibility, the types and sizes of awards, the price and timing of awards and the acceleration or waiver of any vesting restriction, as well as the authority to delegate such administrative responsibilities. However, the full Board will conduct the general administration of the Amended 2010 Plan with respect to any awards to non-employee members of the Board.
Table of Contents
Eligibility 
Persons eligible to participate in the Amended 2010 Plan include our eight non-employee members of the Board, approximately 5,527 employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (including our executive officers), and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Limitation on Awards and Shares Available 
The aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be issued or transferred pursuant to the 2010 Plan is 24,450,000 shares of common stock. If the Amended 2010 Plan is approved by the stockholders, such aggregate number of shares will be 28,450,000. Any shares that are subject to awards of options or stock appreciation rights shall be counted against this limit as one (1) share for every one (1) share granted. Any shares that are subject to awards other than stock options or SARs that are settled in shares of common stock ("Full Value Awards") shall be counted against this limit as 2.3 shares for everyone one (1) share granted. The shares of common stock covered by the Amended 2010 Plan may be treasury shares, authorized but unissued shares, or shares purchased in the open market. 
To the extent that an award terminates, or expires for any reason, or an award is settled in cash without delivery of shares to the participant, then any shares subject to the award may be used again for new grants under the Amended 2010 Plan, provided, that for each share subject to a Full Value Award that so terminated, expired or settled in cash, 2.3 shares shall again become issuable under the Amended 2010 Plan. However, shares which are (i) tendered by the holder or withheld by us in satisfaction of an option exercise price or tax withholding obligations with respect to any award, (ii) subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with a stock settlement of such right, or (iii) purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from an option exercise, will not be available for grant under the Amended 2010 Plan. Under the Amended 2010 Plan any restricted stock repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the participant so that such shares are returned to the Company will again be available for awards. Additionally, the payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares available for issuance. To the extent permitted by applicable law or any exchange rule, shares issued in assumption of, or in substitution for, any outstanding awards of any entity acquired in any form of combination by us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates will not be counted against shares available for issuance under the Amended 2010 Plan. 
The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any one participant pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan during any calendar year is 250,000. The maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid with respect to one or more awards payable in cash that may be granted to any one person pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan during any calendar year is $2,000,000. The aggregate grant date fair value of total equity compensation (consisting of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and any other equity compensation) to any non-employee director in any calendar year in respect of such director's service as a member of our Board or any Board committee during such year shall not exceed $750,000.
Awards 
The Amended 2010 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards, dividend equivalents, performance bonus awards and other performance-based awards to eligible individuals. Certain awards under the Amended 2010 Plan may constitute or provide for a deferral of compensation, subject to Section 409A of the Code, which may impose additional requirements on the terms and conditions of such awards. All awards under the Amended 2010 Plan are or will be set forth in award agreements, which detail the terms and conditions of the awards, including any applicable vesting and payment terms and post-termination exercise limitations. Awards other than cash awards are generally settled in shares of our common stock, but the plan administrator may provide for cash settlement of any award. No determination has been made as to the types or amounts of awards that will be granted to specific individuals pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan. See the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" in this Proxy Statement, for information on prior awards to our NEOs identified in those tables. 
Stock Options. Stock options, including incentive stock options, as defined under Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options may be granted pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan. The option exercise price of all stock options granted pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Stock options may be exercised as determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event may a stock option have a term extending beyond ten years after the date of grant. Incentive stock options 
Table of Contents granted to any person who owns, as of the date of grant, stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock, however, shall have an exercise price that is not less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and may not have a term extending beyond the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. The aggregate fair market value of the shares with respect to which options intended to be incentive stock options are exercisable for the first time by an employee in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Code provides. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights may also be granted under the Amended 2010 Plan. Stock appreciation rights typically will provide for payments to the holder based upon increases in the price of our common stock over the exercise price per share, which will be no less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. SARs may be exercised as determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event may an SAR have a term extending beyond ten years after the date of grant. Upon exercise of a SAR, payment may be made in cash or check or other property acceptable to the Compensation Committee. 
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares. Restricted stock is an award of nontransferable shares of our common stock that remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met, and which may be subject to a purchase price. RSUs are contractual promises to deliver shares of our common stock in the future, which may also remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met. Delivery of the shares underlying these awards may be deferred under the terms of the award or at the election of the participant if the plan administrator permits such a deferral. Performance shares are contractual rights to receive a number of shares of our common stock in the future based on the attainment of specified performance goals, in addition to other conditions which may apply to these awards. Conditions applicable to restricted stock, RSUs and performance shares may be based on continuing service with us or our affiliates, the attainment of performance goals and/or such other conditions as the plan administrator may determine. 
Performance Bonus Awards and Other Performance-Based Awards. Performance bonus awards are cash incentive bonuses subject to performance goals. Other performance-based awards are awards other than those enumerated in this summary that are denominated in, linked to or derived from shares of our common stock or value metrics related to our shares, and may remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met.
Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents represent the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of our common stock and may be granted alone or in tandem with awards. Dividend equivalents are credited as of dividend payments dates during the period between the date an award is granted and the date such award vests, is exercised, is distributed or expires, as determined by the plan administrator. The Amended 2010 Plan requires that any dividend equivalents linked to awards that are subject to performance-based vesting be subject to the same performance-based vesting conditions applicable to the underlying award.  
Performance Awards. Performance awards include any of the awards that are granted subject to vesting and/or payment based on the attainment of specified performance goals.
The Compensation Committee will determine the methods by which payments by any award holder with respect to any awards may be paid, the form of payment, including, without limitation: (1) cash or check; (2) shares (including in the case of payment of the exercise price of an award, shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the award) or shares held for such period of time as may be required by the Compensation Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences, in each case, having a fair market value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate payments required; or (3) other property acceptable to the Compensation Committee (including through the delivery of a notice that the award holder has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to shares of common stock then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an award, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to us in satisfaction of the aggregate payments required; provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to us upon settlement of such sale). However, no participant who is a member of the Board of Directors or an "executive officer" of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act will be permitted to pay the exercise price of an option in any method which would violate the prohibitions on loans made or arranged by us as set forth in Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. 
No Repricing 
In no case (except due to an adjustment to reflect a stock split or similar event or any repricing that may be approved by stockholders) may any adjustment be made to a stock option or a SAR award under the Amended 2010 Plan (by amendment, cancellation and re-grant, exchange or other means) that would constitute a repricing of the per-share exercise or base price of the award. 
Table of Contents
Transferability 
Generally, awards granted under the Amended 2010 Plan will not be transferable by a participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee, pursuant to a domestic relations order. Generally, stock options and SARs will be exercisable during a participant's lifetime only by him or her, unless it has been disposed of pursuant to a domestic relations order; after the death of a participant, any exercisable portion of an option or SAR may be exercised by his personal representative or by any person empowered to do so under the deceased participant's will or under the then applicable laws of descent and distribution. However, the Compensation Committee has the authority to permit a participant to transfer an award other than an incentive stock option to a permitted transferee, subject to the terms and conditions in the Amended 2010 Plan. In no event may an award be transferable for consideration absent stockholder approval. 
Adjustment Provisions 
Certain transactions with our stockholders not involving our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split, spin-off, stock dividend or certain recapitalizations may affect the share price of our common stock (which transactions are referred to collectively as "equity restructurings"). In the event that an equity restructuring occurs, the class, number of shares and exercise or grant price of outstanding awards will be equitably adjusted, and the plan administrator will make such further equitable adjustments as it may deem appropriate to reflect the equity restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Amended 2010 Plan. Other types of transactions may also affect our common stock, such as a dividend or other distribution, reorganization, merger, or other changes in corporate structure. In the event that there is such a transaction, which is not an equity restructuring, and the plan administrator determines that an adjustment to the plan and any outstanding awards would be appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Amended 2010 Plan, the plan administrator will equitably adjust the Amended 2010 Plan as to the class of shares issuable and the maximum number of shares of our stock subject to the Amended 2010 Plan, as well as the maximum number of shares that may be issued to an employee during any calendar year, and will adjust any outstanding awards as to the class, number of shares, and price per share of our stock in such manner as it may deem equitable.
Effect of Certain Corporate Transactions 
For purposes of the Amended 2010 Plan, a "change in control" generally means certain transactions in which a person acquires 50% or more of our total voting power; certain changes in the composition of our Board of Directors over a two-year period; a merger or consolidation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in our voting securities outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent at least 50% of the total voting power represented by our voting securities or such surviving entity's voting securities outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation (or the voting securities of the parent of the entity which survives such merger or consolidation); a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, other than a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets to an entity, at least 80% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by persons in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of us immediately prior to such sale; or approval by our stockholders of a plan of complete liquidation. The Board, in its sole discretion, may adopt a change in control program to determine the vesting schedule, exercisability and other terms of outstanding awards on or after a change in control. 
Amendment and Termination 
The Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors may terminate, amend, or modify the Amended 2010 Plan at any time; however, stockholder approval will be obtained for any amendment to increase the number of shares available under the Amended 2010 Plan. In addition, absent stockholder approval, no option or SAR may be amended to reduce the per share exercise price of the shares subject to such option or SAR below the per share exercise price as of the date the option or SAR was granted and, except to the extent permitted by the Amended 2010 Plan in connection with certain changes in capital structure, no option, SAR, cash or other award may be granted in exchange for, or in connection with, the cancellation or surrender of an option or SAR having a higher per share exercise price. 
In no event may an award be granted pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the date the Board approved the Amended 2010 Plan. 
Table of Contents
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a general summary under current U.S. law of the material federal income tax consequences with respect to the Amended 2010 Plan. This summary deals with the general U.S. tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information. Some kinds of taxes, such as foreign, state and local income taxes, as well as gift and estate tax considerations, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality, and the summary does not discuss all aspects of income taxation that may be relevant in light of a holder's personal investment circumstances. 
With respect to nonqualified stock options, we are generally entitled to deduct, and the optionee recognizes taxable income in an amount equal to, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. A participant receiving incentive stock options will not recognize taxable income upon grant. Additionally, if applicable holding period requirements are met, the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise. However, the excess of the fair market value of the common stock received over the option price is an item of tax preference income potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax. If stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option is held for a minimum of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, the gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition of the stock will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and we will not be entitled to any deduction. If the holding period requirements are not met, the incentive stock option will be treated as one that does not meet the requirements of the Code for incentive stock options and the tax consequences described for nonqualified stock options will apply. 
The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the Amended 2010 Plan generally follow certain basic patterns: SARs are taxed and deductible in substantially the same manner as nonqualified stock options; nontransferable restricted stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and restricted stock units will result in income recognition equal to the excess of the fair market value over the price paid, if any, only at the time the restrictions applicable to such awards lapse (unless, with respect to an award of restricted stock, the recipient elects to accelerate recognition as of the date of grant); stock-based performance awards, dividend equivalents and other types of awards are generally subject to tax at ordinary income rates at the time of payment. In each of the foregoing cases, the Company will generally have a corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes income, subject to Section 162(m) with respect to covered employees.
New Plan Benefits 
As of February 19, 2019, 15,498,561 shares subject to options awards and 4,516,155 RSUs had been granted pursuant to the 2010 Plan. Awards, if any, to be granted to officers, employees and consultants are determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee and are not presently determinable, other than annual awards made to our directors pursuant to our non-employee director compensation program. On the date of our Annual Meeting, we expect that our non-employee directors as a group will receive options with an aggregate value of $1.2 million and RSUs with an aggregate value of $1.2 million pursuant to the Amended 2010 Plan. For additional detail on the compensation to our non-employee directors, please see "Compensation for Directors" above.

PROPOSAL NO. 5
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING ELIMINATION OF SUPERMAJORITY VOTING PROVISIONS
The Company has been advised that a stockholder, Myra K. Young, of 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, California 95758, owner of six shares of our common stock, intends to present the following stockholder proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") through her designee, John Chevedden of 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California. If the stockholder (or her "qualified representative") is present at the Annual Meeting and properly submits the proposal for a vote, then the stockholder proposal will be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. In accordance with federal securities laws, the stockholder proposal is presented below as submitted by the stockholder and is quoted verbatim. The Company disclaims all responsibility for the content of the proposal and the supporting statement, including other sources referenced in the supporting statement.
Proposal 5 — Simple Majority Vote
RESOLVED, Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be eliminated, and replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. This means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. It is important that our company take each step necessary to adopt this proposal topic. It is also important that our company take each step necessary to avoid a failed vote on this proposal topic.
Supporting Statement: Shareowners are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of six entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to "What Matters in Corporate Governance" by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=593423).
Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management. The majority of S&P 500 and S&P 1500 companies have no supermajority voting requirements. Additionally, unlike many S&P 500 and S&P 1500 companies, our shareholders cannot act by written consent or by calling a special meeting.
This proposal topic won from 59.2% to 75.1% of the vote at Kaman, DowDuPont and Ryder System in early 2018. Prior to that, it won 74% to 99% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill, Macy's, Ferro Arconic, and Cognizant Technology Solutions.
Our largest shareholder, T. Rowe Price, generally votes for proposals to adopt simple majority requirements for all items that require shareholder approval. Vanguard, generally supports proposals to remove supermajority requirements and opposes proposals to impose them. Fidelity, generally votes against supermajority requirements. BlackRock supports the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that they determine shareholders' ability to protect their economic interests is improved.
Currently a 1% special interest minority of shares can frustrate the will of shareholders casting 66% of shares in favor. In other words a 1% special interest minority could have the power to prevent shareholders from improving our corporate governance.
Please vote to enhance shareholder value:
SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE — PROPOSAL 5
Table of Contents
Vote Required
Approval of Proposal No. 5 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
BOARD STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") has carefully considered this proposal and concluded that its adoption is unnecessary and not in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal for the reasons outlined below.
The Company has an excellent corporate governance structure
The Board is firmly committed to excellence in corporate governance and has adopted a wide range of practices and procedures that promote effective Board oversight. Some of the Company's progressive governance policies and practices include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all directors are elected annually; 
• a majority voting standard applies in uncontested elections of directors, such that in an uncontested election, a nominee will be elected to the Board if the number of shares voted for the nominee exceeds the number of shares voted against the nominee, and if an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of votes cast, he or she is expected to offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board; 
• 9 of our 10 current directors are "independent" under the standards adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market;  
• our current leadership structure separates the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; 
• the Board's Lead Director presides at meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, and provides feedback from such executive sessions to the Chairman, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, and other senior management;  
• the Company has adopted proxy access, which allows stockholders owning at least 3% of the Company's common stock for three years to nominate, and include in the Company's proxy materials, director candidates constituting up to 25% of the Board; 
• the Board's Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee are each comprised solely of independent directors; and 
• the Governance and Nominating Committee regularly identifies, reviews, evaluates and nominates candidates to serve on the Board. 
[END TABLE]
The Company's existing voting thresholds protect stockholders' long-term interests
A majority of votes cast, or simple majority, is already the voting standard for most matters voted upon by our stockholders under the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate") and Bylaws (together with the Certificate, the "Governance Documents"). Pursuant to the Bylaws, all matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter, except where a different voting standard is required by law or the Governance Documents. A stricter voting standard is only required for the three matters outlined below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The removal of directors. The removal of a director, with or without cause, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting (the "Company's outstanding voting power"); 
• Bylaws. The adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws requires the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the Company's outstanding voting power; and 
• Certificate. The amendment or repeal of certain provisions of the Certificate requires the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the Company's outstanding voting power. 
[END TABLE]
These voting standards are intended to comply with applicable law, to maximize long-term value for all stockholders and to provide protection for all stockholders against self-interested actions of one or a few large stockholders. The Board believes that in these limited circumstances, the higher voting requirements are appropriate because certain fundamental matters should require the support of a broad consensus of the Company's stockholders, rather than a simple majority of the votes cast at a meeting.
Consistent with its current practice, our Board will continue to evaluate the future implementation of appropriate corporate governance measures. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Board does not believe that it is in 
Table of Contents the best interests of stockholders or the Company to implement the proposal's request for the lowest possible voting thresholds on all matters on which stockholders vote.
Stockholders benefit from supermajority provisions
Delaware law permits companies to adopt supermajority voting requirements, and many companies have adopted such provisions to preserve and maximize long-term value for all stockholders. Under a simple majority voting standard, where only a "majority of the votes cast for and against" is required, a few large stockholders could approve certain key actions, such as amending our Certificate or Bylaws, and significantly alter the governance of the Company. For example, if a simple majority voting standard were adopted as proposed, and only 50.1% of the Company's outstanding voting power is present at a stockholder meeting, holders of just 25.1% of the Company's outstanding voting power could approve fundamental changes to the Company's Certificate or Bylaws that could negatively impact the interests of all stockholders. As a result, if this proposal were adopted, a very small group of stockholders would be able to act in their own self-interests, to the detriment of the Company's other stockholders. Our Board believes that the few heightened voting standards currently established by the Governance Documents protect our stockholders against the self-interested actions of a few stockholders and should be retained.
Recommendation of the Board

The Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal to implement a simple majority vote.

OTHER INFORMATION
Other Matters at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
We do not know of any matters to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") other than those mentioned in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies. 
Security Holder Communication with Board Members
Any holder of our securities may contact the Board of Directors or a specified individual director by writing to the attention of the Board of Directors or a specified individual director and sending such communication to our investor relations department at our executive offices as identified in this Proxy Statement. Each communication from a security holder should include the following information in order to permit security holder status to be confirmed and to provide an address to forward a response if deemed appropriate:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name, mailing address and telephone number of the security holder sending the communication.  
• The number and type of our securities owned by such security holder.  
• If the security holder is not a record owner of our securities, the name of the record owner of our securities beneficially owned by the security holder.  
[END TABLE]
Our investor relations department will forward all appropriate communications to the Board of Directors or individual members of the Board of Directors as specified in the communication. Our investor relations department may (but is not required to) review all correspondence addressed to the Board of Directors, or any individual member of the Board of Directors, for any inappropriate correspondence more suitably directed to management. Communications may be deemed inappropriate for this purpose if it is reasonably apparent from the face of the correspondence that it relates principally to a customer dispute involving the purchase of goods or services from our Company or any of our operating units. Our policies regarding the handling of security holder communications were approved by a majority of our independent directors.

Exhibit A
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding items such as intangible assets charges, share-based compensation ("SBC") expenses, and other special items. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business.
Non-GAAP income from operations. We define non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations excluding intangible assets charges, expenses related to SBC, and litigation charges.
Non-GAAP net income. We define non-GAAP net income as net income excluding intangible asset charges; expenses related to SBC; litigation charges and recoveries; non-cash impairment of investments, net of the related tax effects; and tax adjustments including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, the one-time impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("2017 Tax Act"), and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. We exclude the one-time impact of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act because it is discrete in nature as well as the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements and the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers as the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on our operating results.
There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income exclude items such as intangible asset charges, SBC, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP net income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and evaluating non-GAAP net income together with net income calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The table below sets forth the reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures.

6.1 Granting of Options to Eligible Individuals. The Administrator is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its sole discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine which shall not be inconsistent with the Plan.

Table of Contents
No person who qualifies as a Greater Than 10% Stockholder may be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. Any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan may be modified by the Administrator, with the consent of the Holder, to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.

6.3 Option Exercise Price. The exercise price per Share subject to each Option shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). In addition, in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code).
6.4 Option Term. The term of each Option shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the term shall not be more than ten (10) years from the date the Option is granted, or five (5) years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder.

(a) The period during which the right to exercise, in whole or in part, an Option vests in the Holder shall be set by the Administrator and the Administrator may determine that an Option may not be exercised in whole or in part for a specified period after it is granted. Such vesting may be based on service with the Company or any Affiliate, any Performance Criteria, or any other criteria selected by the Administrator.
(b) No portion of an Option which is unexercisable at a Holder's Termination of Service shall thereafter become exercisable, except as may be otherwise provided by the Administrator either in the Program, the Award Agreement or by action of the Administrator following the grant of the Option.
6.6 Substitute Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 6 to the contrary, in the case of an Option that is a Substitute Award, the price per share of the shares subject to such Option may be less than the Fair Market Value per share on the date of grant, provided, that the excess of: (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date such Substitute Award is granted) of the shares subject to the Substitute Award, over (b) the aggregate exercise price thereof does not exceed the excess of: (x) the aggregate fair market value (as of the time immediately preceding the transaction giving rise to the Substitute Award, such fair market value to be determined by the Administrator) of the shares of the predecessor entity that were subject to the grant assumed or substituted for by the Company, over (y) the aggregate exercise price of such shares.
6.7 Substitution of Stock Appreciation Rights. The Administrator may provide in the applicable Program or the Award Agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall have the right to substitute a Stock Appreciation Right for such Option at any time prior to or upon exercise of such Option; provided, 
Table of Contents that such Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable with respect to the same number of Shares for which such substituted Option would have been exercisable.
ARTICLE 7.

(c) In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 11.3 by any person or persons other than the Holder, appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option, as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator; and
(d) Full payment of the exercise price and applicable withholding taxes to the stock administrator of the Company for the shares with respect to which the Option, or portion thereof, is exercised, in a manner permitted by Section 11.1 and 11.2.
7.3 Notification Regarding Disposition. The Holder shall give the Company prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which occurs within (a) two years from the date of granting (including the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) such Option to such Holder, or (b) one year after the transfer of such shares to such Holder.

(ii) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices;
(iii) To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of the Company's stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and in the number and kind of outstanding Restricted Stock and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the criteria included in, outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted in the future;
(iv) To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully vested with respect to all shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement; and

(c) In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 13.2(a) and 13.2(b):
(i) The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, shall be equitably adjusted; and/or
(ii) The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments, if any, as the Administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind of shares which may be issued under the Plan and adjustments of the Award Limit). The adjustments provided under this Section 10.2(c) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Holder and the Company.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Board, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, is authorized to adopt or put into place a change in control program to determine the vesting schedule, exercisability and other terms of outstanding Awards on or after a Change in Control.
(e) The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, include such further provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate, as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.
(f) With respect to Awards which are granted to Covered Employees and are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, no adjustment or action described in this Section 13.2 or in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment or action would cause such Award to fail to so qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, unless the Administrator determines that the Award should not so qualify.
(g) No adjustment or action described in this Section 13.2 or in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment or action would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code. Furthermore, no such adjustment or action shall be authorized to the extent such adjustment or action would result in short-swing profits liability under Section 16 or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule 16b-3 unless the Administrator determines that the Award is not to comply with such exemptive conditions.

13.5 Paperless Administration. In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Holder may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.
13.6 Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans. The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate.

13.7 Compliance with Laws. The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state, federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded, and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal 
Table of Contents requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.
13.8 Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.

To the extent applicable, the Plan, the Program and any Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.

13.12 Unfunded Status of Awards. The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
13.13 Indemnification. To the extent allowable pursuant to applicable law, each member of the Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
13.14 Relationship to other Benefits. No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.
