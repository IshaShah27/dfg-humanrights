VOTING INSTRUCTIONS
Quorum and Voting
The Amended and Restated By-Laws of JNL Series Trust, dated June 1, 1994 as amended and restated on September 25, 2017 (the "By-Laws"), provide that, the holders of a majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at a Shareholder meeting, except where any provision of law or the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust dated June 1, 1994 and amended and restated on September 25, 2017 (the "Declaration of Trust") provides otherwise. The presence of Jackson National and/or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York ("Jackson NY," and together with Jackson National, the "Insurance Companies"), through the presence of an authorized representative, constitutes a quorum.
The By-Laws further provide that shares may be voted in person or by proxy. A proxy with respect to shares held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise of the proxy the Trust receives a specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Shareholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving its invalidity shall rest on the challenger. At all meetings of Shareholders, unless inspectors of election have been appointed, all questions relating to the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided by the chairman of the meeting. Any person giving voting instructions may revoke them at any time prior to their exercise by submitting to the Secretary of the Trust a superseding voting instruction form or written notice of revocation. Voting instructions can be revoked until the Meeting date. Only the Contract Owner executing the voting instructions can revoke them. The Insurance Companies will vote the shares of the Fund in accordance with all properly executed and unrevoked voting instructions. Unless otherwise specified in the proxy, the proxy shall apply to all shares of the Fund owned by the Shareholder.
Required Vote
Generally, a simple majority of votes cast is sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may be presented for a Shareholder vote, unless a different vote is required by law, the Declaration of Trust or the By-Laws. Where a vote of the "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of a Fund is required to approve a proposal, it shall mean the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at the Meeting if holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Except as otherwise provided by law, if a Shareholder abstains from voting as to any matter, then the shares represented by such abstention will be treated as shares that are present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. However, abstentions will not be counted as a vote cast on such proposal. The approval of a Proposal depends upon whether a sufficient number of votes are cast for the Proposal. Accordingly, an instruction to abstain from voting on a Proposal has the same practical effect as an instruction to vote against the Proposal.
Approval of the Proposals will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all of the Shares present or represented and voting on that Proposal.
If the Proposals are approved by Shareholders of the Fund, they will be implemented on or about  June 24 , 2019.
Contract Owner Voting Instructions
The Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Interests in the Fund, a series of the Trust, are represented by shares. Shares of the Fund currently are sold only to separate accounts of Jackson National or Jackson NY to fund the benefits of variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts ("Variable Contracts") issued by Jackson National or Jackson NY (the "issuing insurers"), to employee benefit plans of Jackson National or directly to Jackson National, Jackson NY, or to regulated investment companies. Although the issuing insurers legally own all of the shares of the Fund held in their respective separate accounts that relate to Variable Contracts, a portion of the value of your Variable Contract is invested by the relevant issuing insurer, as provided in your Variable Contract, in shares of the Fund.
You have the right under your Variable Contract to instruct the issuing insurer how to vote the shares attributable to your Variable Contract. The issuing insurer will vote all such shares in accordance with the voting instructions timely given by the owners of Variable Contracts ("Contract Owners") with assets invested in the Fund. Contract Owners at the close of business on January 25, 2019 (the "Record Date"), will be entitled to notice of the Meeting and to instruct the relevant issuing insurer how to vote at the Meeting or any adjourned session. Jackson National and Jackson NY will vote shares owned by themselves or by the plans in proportion to voting instructions timely given by Contract Owners.
Contract Owners may use the enclosed voting instructions form as a ballot to give their voting instructions for those shares attributable to their Variable Contracts as of the Record Date. When a Contract Owner completes the voting instructions form and sends it to the appropriate issuing insurer, that issuing insurer will vote the shares attributable to the Variable Contract of the Contract Owner in accordance with the Contract Owner's instructions. If a Contract Owner merely signs and returns the form, the issuing insurer will vote those shares in favor of a Proposal. If the Contract Owner does not return the form, the issuing insurer will vote those shares in the same proportion as shares for which instructions were received from other Contract Owners. As a result of proportionate voting, a small number of Contract Owners could determine the outcome of the Proposals. The issuing insurers have fixed the close of business on March 13, 2019, as the last day on which voting instructions will be accepted. 
Adjournments
Any authorized voting instructions will be valid for any adjournment of the Meeting. If the Trust receives an insufficient number of votes to approve a Proposal, the Meeting may be adjourned to permit the solicitation of additional votes.
The Meeting may be adjourned by the chairperson of the Meeting from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place as determined by the chairperson of the Meeting for any reason, including failure of a Proposal to receive sufficient votes for approval. No Shareholder vote shall be required for any adjournment. No notice need be given that the Meeting has been adjourned other than by announcement at the Meeting. Any business that might have been transacted at the original Meeting may be transacted at any adjourned Meeting.
Revocation of Voting Instructions
Any person giving voting instructions may revoke them at any time prior to the Meeting by submitting to the Insurance Companies a superseding voting instruction form or written notice of revocation or by appearing and voting in person at the Meeting. Only the Contract Owner executing the voting instructions can revoke them. The Insurance Companies will vote the shares of the Fund in accordance with all properly executed and un-revoked voting instructions.

Introduction
The Trust, a Massachusetts business trust, is an open-end investment company, commonly known as a mutual fund, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"). The Trust currently offers shares in 123 funds, including the JNL/Mellon Capital European 30 Fund (in this Proposal, the "Fund"). This proxy statement is being furnished to Shareholders of the Fund. 
Under Proposal 1, it is proposed that the Fund undergo changes to its name, investment objective, investment strategy, and primary and secondary benchmarks (in this Proposal, the "Strategy Changes").
The Trust is providing this proxy statement to Shareholders investing in the Funds as of January 25, 2019, the Record Date.
Jackson National Asset Management, LLC ("JNAM" or "Adviser") is the investment adviser to the Trust and provides the Trust with professional investment supervision and management. JNAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson National, which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential plc, a publicly traded company incorporated in the United Kingdom. Prudential plc is not affiliated in any manner with Prudential Financial Inc., a company whose principal place of business is in the United States of America.  JNAM also serves as the Fund's Administrator.
As the investment adviser to the Trust, JNAM selects, contracts with, compensates, and monitors sub-advisers to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of each of the funds in the Trust.  In addition, JNAM monitors the compliance of the sub-advisers with the investment objectives and related policies of each series of the Trust, reviews the performance of the sub-advisers, and reports on such performance to the Board. 
Board Approval 
At a meeting held on December 10-12, 2018 (the "Board Meeting"), the Board, including the Trustees who are not "interested persons" as defined by the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"), of the Trust voted to approve a change to the Fund's name from "JNL/Mellon Capital European 30 Fund" to "JNL/RAFI® Fundamental Europe Fund" and changes to the Fund's investment objective, investment strategy, and primary and secondary benchmarks. These changes are referred to as the "Strategy Changes" in this proxy statement.
At the Board Meeting, the Board, including the Independent Trustees, of the Trust also voted to approve certain changes to the Fund's advisory and sub-advisory fee schedules in connection with the Strategy Changes. The changes to the Fund's advisory and sub-advisory fee schedules will be effective June 24, 2019.  Specifically, the change to the Fund's advisory fee schedule will eliminate a breakpoint in the current fee schedule and use a lower fee rate for that net asset level. The changes to the Fund's sub-advisory fee schedule will change the Fund's breakpoints so that the sub-advisory fee rates are the same or lower at any level of net assets. At the Board Meeting, the Board also reviewed a new license agreement between JNAM and RAFI Indices, LLC ("RAFI") in connection with the Strategy Changes. The Fund will pay the new license fee, which will increase the Fund's total annual operating expenses.
Information Regarding Strategy Changes for the Fund
The RAFI® Fundamental Europe Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the RAFI® Fundamental Europe Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed European countries. A company's eligibility for the universe is determined by the company's relative size based on its fundamental weight, calculated using adjusted sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks, and book value.
If Shareholders approve the Strategy Changes, the Fund's investment objective and investment strategies will be revised to reflect that the Fund will no longer invest in securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Europe Index. A comparison of the Fund's current investment objective and principal investment strategies and the proposed investment objective and principal investment strategies is shown in the table below.

 Investment Objective The investment objective of the Fund is to provide capital appreciation.   Investment Objective The investment objective of the Fund is to match the performance of the RAFI® Fundamental Europe Index.

 Investment Objective The investment objective of the Fund is to provide capital appreciation.   Investment Objective The investment objective of the Fund is to match the performance of the RAFI® Fundamental Europe Index.    
 Principal Investment Strategies The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Europe Index.   Principal Investment Strategies The Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the component securities ("Component Securities") of the RAFI Fundamental Europe Index (the "Index"). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in cash, securities, and instruments that are not Component Securities but which Mellon Investments Corporation, the Fund's sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"), believes will help the Fund track its Index. The Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all or substantially all of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index. Indexing may offer a cost-effective investment approach to gaining diversified market exposure over the long-term.

 The Fund selects 30 securities from the MSCI Europe Index, based on screens evaluating volatility, efficiency of company management, and a valuation-to-price ratio. The securities are placed into 1 of the 4 following country groupings:● United Kingdom;● Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland;● Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden; and● Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain  No corresponding strategy.

As of September 30, 2018, the Index consisted of 414 Component Securities. The Index is reconstituted annually and rebalanced on a quarterly staggered basis on the last business day of March, June, and September and the third Friday of December. The Index is split into four equal parts (tranches), and each tranche has equal weight at the March rebalance. Each tranche is rebalanced once a year to target weights determined for that quarter.

Information Regarding Principal Risks
If Shareholders approve the Strategy Changes, the Fund's principal risks will also be revised consistent with investing in securities that comprise the RAFI® Fundamental Europe Index. A comparison of the Fund's current principal risks and the proposed principal risks are shown in the table below.

Information Regarding Primary and Secondary Benchmark Changes
As part of the Strategy Changes, JNAM proposes to change the Fund's primary and secondary benchmarks as shown in the table below. JNAM recommends these changes to the primary and secondary benchmarks for consistency with the proposed Strategy Changes.
For complete disclosure of the Fund's investment objective, investment strategies, risks and other related disclosure, as well as how this disclosure is proposed to be revised, please see Appendix A.
Information Regarding Fee Changes
In connection with the Strategy Changes, there will be changes to the total expenses for the Fund, as discussed below.
Management Fees
In connection with the Strategy Changes, JNAM will reduce its management fees. The Fund currently pays JNAM an advisory fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the following schedule:
After the Strategy Changes, the Fund will pay JNAM an advisory fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the following schedule:
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of management fees paid by the Fund to the Adviser for the year ended December 31, 2018. The pro forma aggregate amount of management fees paid to the Adviser would have been lower had the Strategy Changes occurred during the applicable period.
Sub-Advisory Fees
JNAM is responsible for paying the sub-advisory fee out of its own resources. The sub-advisory fee schedule in connection with the Strategy Changes is different than the sub-advisory fee schedule currently. The Mellon is currently paid a sub-advisory fee equal to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets based on the below schedule. 
After the Strategy Changes, Mellon will be paid a sub-advisory fee equal to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets based on the below schedule:
For the year ended December 31, 2018, JNAM paid $ 160,675 in sub-advisory fees for its services to the Fund. The pro forma sub-advisory fees would have been lower than the fees paid to the Mellon had the Strategy Changes occurred during the applicable period.
Index Licensing Fees
At the Board Meeting, the Board reviewed a new license agreement between JNAM and RAFI in connection with the Strategy Changes. The Fund will pay the license fees, which will increase the Fund's total annual operating expenses.
Annual Operating Expenses
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)
The Board has approved the expense changes for the Fund reflected in the tables below. Fees and expenses for the Fund are based on those incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The pro forma fees and expenses of the Fund assume that the Strategy Changes had been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
1 "Other Expenses" include an Administrative Fee of 0.15% which is payable to JNAM.
2 Expense information has been restated to reflect current fees.
Expense Examples
The expense example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. Also, this example does not reflect the expenses of the Variable Contracts or the separate account through which you indirectly invest in the Fund, whichever may be applicable, and the total expenses would be higher if they were included. The table below shows the expenses you would pay on a $10,000 investment, assuming (1) 5% annual return; (2) redemption at the end of each time period; and (3) that the Fund operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:
Brokerage Commissions and Fund Transactions
With respect to portfolio security transactions, JNAM and Mellon would attempt to achieve best execution and have complete freedom as to the markets in and the broker/dealers through which they seek this result. JNAM and  Mellon would be authorized, consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, when placing portfolio transactions for the Fund with a broker to pay a brokerage commission (to the extent applicable) in excess of that which another broker might have charged for effecting the same transaction on account of the receipt of research, market or statistical information. The term "research, market or statistical information" may include (a) advice as to (i) the value of securities, (ii) the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and (iii) the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and (b) furnishing analysis and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. Higher commissions are authorized to be paid to firms that provide research services to the extent permitted by law. JNAM and Mellon would be able to use this research information in managing the Fund's assets, as well as the assets of other clients. However,  Mellon currently does not plan to use soft dollars, engage in directed brokerage or engage in cross trades with client accounts it manages in connection with the Fund's securities transactions.
Any portfolio transaction for the Fund may be executed through brokers that are affiliated with the Fund, other funds of the Trust, JNAM, and/or a sub-adviser, if, in the sub-adviser's judgment, the use of such affiliated brokers is likely to result in price and execution at least as favorable as those of other qualified brokers, and if, in the transaction, the affiliated broker charges the Fund a commission rate consistent with those charged by the affiliated broker to comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. All transactions with affiliated brokers will comply with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid no commissions to any affiliated broker.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid $ 1,306,589 in 12b-1 fees to JNAM and/or its affiliated persons. It is expected that the services under the Amended and Restated Distribution Plan for the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, will continue after the Proposals discussed herein become effective.
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 1.

Information Regarding Strategy Changes for the Fund
JNAM is recommending certain changes for the Fund. JNAM is the investment adviser to the Fund, and Mellon Investments Corporation (" Mellon ") is the sub-adviser. There are no proposed changes to the investment adviser or sub-adviser under Proposal 2. The Strategy Changes are being proposed to convert the Fund from a passively managed fund that invests in the securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Pacific Index to a passively managed fund that invests in securities that comprise the RAFI® Asia Developed Index.
In implementing the proposed investment strategy, Mellon , as the Fund's sub-adviser, will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the component securities of the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index. Mellon will invest the remainder of the Fund's assets in cash, securities, and instruments that are not component securities of the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index but which Mellon believes will help the Fund track the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index. The Fund will attempt to replicate the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index by investing all or substantially all of its assets in the stocks that make up the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index.
The RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the RAFI® Fundamental Asia Developed Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed Asian countries. A company's eligibility for the universe is determined by the company's relative size based on its fundamental weight, calculated using adjusted sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks, and book value.
If Shareholders approve the Strategy Changes, the Fund's investment objective and investment strategies will be revised to reflect that the Fund will no longer invest in securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Pacific Index. A comparison of the Fund's current investment objective and principal investment strategies and the proposed investment objective and principal investment strategies is shown in the table below.

Information Regarding Fee Changes
In connection with the Strategy Changes, there will be changes to the total expenses for the Fund, as discussed below.
Management Fees
In connection with the Strategy Changes, JNAM will reduce its management fees. The Fund currently pays JNAM an advisory fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the following schedule:
After the Strategy Changes, the Fund will pay JNAM an advisory fee equal to a percentage of its average daily net assets based on the following schedule:
The following table sets forth the aggregate amount of management fees paid by the Fund to the Adviser for the year ended December 31, 2018. The pro forma aggregate amount of management fees paid to the Adviser would have been lower had the Strategy Changes occurred during the applicable period.
Sub-Advisory Fees
JNAM is responsible for paying the sub-advisory fee out of its own resources. The sub-advisory fee schedule in connection with the Strategy Changes is different than the sub-advisory fee schedule currently. The  Mellon is currently paid a sub-advisory fee equal to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets based on the below schedule. 
After the Strategy Changes, Mellon will be paid a sub-advisory fee equal to a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets based on the below schedule:
For the year ended December 31, 2018, JNAM paid $ 113,791 in sub-advisory fees for its services to the Fund. The pro forma sub-advisory fees would have been lower than the fees paid to the Mellon had the Strategy Changes occurred during the applicable period.
Index Licensing Fees
At the Board Meeting, the Board reviewed a new license agreement between JNAM and RAFI in connection with the Strategy Changes. The Fund will pay the license fees, which will increase the Fund's total annual operating expenses.
Annual Operating Expenses
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)
The Board has approved the expense changes for the Fund reflected in the tables below. Fees and expenses for the Fund are based on those incurred for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The pro forma fees and expenses of the Fund assume that the Strategy Changes had been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
1 "Other Expenses" include an Administrative Fee of 0.15% which is payable to JNAM.
2 Expense information has been restated to reflect current fees.
Expense Examples
The expense example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. Also, this example does not reflect the expenses of the Variable Contracts or the separate account through which you indirectly invest in the Fund, whichever may be applicable, and the total expenses would be higher if they were included. The table below shows the expenses you would pay on a $10,000 investment, assuming (1) 5% annual return; (2) redemption at the end of each time period; and (3) that the Fund operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:
Brokerage Commissions and Fund Transactions
With respect to portfolio security transactions, JNAM and Mellon would attempt to achieve best execution and have complete freedom as to the markets in and the broker/dealers through which they seek this result. JNAM and Mellon would be authorized, consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, when placing portfolio transactions for the Fund with a broker to pay a brokerage commission (to the extent applicable) in excess of that which another broker might have charged for effecting the same transaction on account of the receipt of research, market or statistical information. The term "research, market or statistical information" may include (a) advice as to (i) the value of securities, (ii) the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and (iii) the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and (b) furnishing analysis and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. Higher commissions are authorized to be paid to firms that provide research services to the extent permitted by law. JNAM and Mellon would be able to use this research information in managing the Fund's assets, as well as the assets of other clients. However,  Mellon currently does not plan to use soft dollars, engage in directed brokerage or engage in cross trades with client accounts it manages in connection with the Fund's securities transactions.
Any portfolio transaction for the Fund may be executed through brokers that are affiliated with the Fund, other funds of the Trust, JNAM, and/or a sub-adviser, if, in the sub-adviser's judgment, the use of such affiliated brokers is likely to result in price and execution at least as favorable as those of other qualified brokers, and if, in the transaction, the affiliated broker charges the Fund a commission rate consistent with those charged by the affiliated broker to comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. All transactions with affiliated brokers will comply with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid no commissions to any affiliated broker.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund paid $ 837,596 in 12b-1 fees to JNAM and/or its affiliated persons. It is expected that the services under the Amended and Restated Distribution Plan for the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, will continue after the Proposals discussed herein become effective.
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF ITS INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS OF THE FUND VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 2.
OTHER MATTERS
JNAM, the investment adviser to the Trust, is located at 225 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. JNAM also serves as the Trust's Administrator. Jackson National Life Distributors LLC ("JNLD"), an affiliate of the JNAM and the Trust, is principal underwriter for the Trust, including the Fund, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson. JNLD is located at 300 Innovation Drive, Franklin, Tennessee 37067. JNLD also is the principal underwriter of the variable annuity insurance products issued by Jackson National and its subsidiaries.
OUTSTANDING SHARES
The Trustees have fixed the close of business on January 25, 2019, as the Record Date for the determination of the Shareholders entitled to vote at the Meeting. Shareholders on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote for each full share held and to a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional share. As of the Record Date, there were issued and outstanding the following number of the Funds' shares:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Fund  Shares    Outstanding 
   Fund  Shares    Outstanding 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Fund  Shares    Outstanding 
   Fund  Shares    Outstanding 
[END TABLE]
As of January 25, 2019, the officers and Trustees of the Trust, as a group, owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of each of the Funds.
Because shares in the Trust are sold only to Jackson National, Jackson NY, certain Funds of the Trust, and certain investment companies managed by affiliates of JNAM organized as Fund of Funds, Jackson National, through its separate accounts which hold shares in the Trust as funding vehicles for variable insurance contracts and certain retirement plans, is the owner of record of substantially all of the shares of the Trust. In addition, Jackson National, through its general account, is the beneficial owner of shares in certain of the funds, in some cases representing the initial capital contributed at the inception of a fund, and in other cases representing investments made for other corporate purposes. As may be required by applicable law and interpretations of the staff of the SEC, Jackson National and Jackson NY will solicit voting instructions from owners of Variable Contracts regarding matters submitted to Shareholder vote and will vote the shares held by its separate accounts in accordance with the voting instructions received from Contract Owners to whose contracts such shares are attributable. This is sometimes referred to as "pass through" voting. Further, those shares which are owned by Jackson National through its general account, and shares held in the separate accounts for which no voting instructions are received from Contract Owners, also will be voted in the same proportions as those shares for which voting instructions are received from Contract Owners. This is sometimes referred to as "echo" voting.
As of the Record Date, January 25, 2019, no persons owned 5% or more of the shares of the Funds either beneficially or of record . 
Contract Owners may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial interest in the Funds' shares owned by the separate accounts. As noted above, Contract Owners have the right to give instructions to the insurance company Shareholders as to how to vote the Funds' shares attributable to their Variable Contracts. As of January 25, 2019, no persons may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial interest totaling more than 25% of the voting securities of the JNL/Mellon Capital Pacific Rim 30 Fund.  As of January 25, 2019, the following person may be deemed to have an indirect beneficial interest totaling more than 25% of the voting securities of the JNL/Mellon Capital European 30 Fund: 
CONTINGENCY PLAN
Proposal 1 and Proposal 2 are contingent upon one another. If each proposal is not approved by Shareholders of each respective Fund, each Fund's name, investment objective, investment strategy, and primary and secondary benchmarks will not change as described under each "Summary of the Proposal" sections, and each Fund will continue to operate as it currently does. In that case, the Board will consider what, if any, course of action should be taken. While the Board has made no determination regarding this contingency, it is possible that the Board would determine to re-solicit the Shareholders of each Fund to approve each Proposal.
OTHER BUSINESS
The Trustees do not intend to present and do not have reason to believe that others will present any other items of business at the Meeting. However, if other matters are properly presented to the Meeting for a vote, the proxies will be voted upon such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons acting under the proxies.
The Trust does not hold regular meetings of Shareholders. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a subsequent meeting of Shareholders should send their written proposals to the Secretary of the Trust at the address set forth on the first page of this proxy statement.
Proposals must be received a reasonable time prior to the date of a meeting of Shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for a meeting. Timely submission of a proposal does not, however, necessarily mean that the proposal will be included. Persons named as proxies for any subsequent meeting of Shareholders will vote in their discretion with respect to proposals submitted on an untimely basis.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES AND CONTRACT OWNER VOTING INSTRUCTIONS
In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, voting instructions may be solicited by letter, telephone, or personal contact by officers or employees of the Trust, JNAM, or Jackson National.
JNAM, as the Trust's Administrator, has retained the services of Computershare Fund Services ("Computershare"), 2950 Express Drive South, Suite 210, Islandia, New York 11749, to assist in the solicitation of voting instructions. The anticipated cost of the services to be provided by Computershare in connection with this proxy solicitation is approximately $127,485.
The costs of the printing and mailing of the Notice, this Proxy Statement, and the accompanying voting instruction card, and the solicitation of Contract Owner voting instructions, will be paid by JNAM. The Trust is not expected to bear any significant expenses in connection with the Meeting or the solicitation of proxies and voting instructions.
PROMPT EXECUTION AND RETURN OF THE ENCLOSED VOTING INSTRUCTIONS FORM IS REQUESTED. A SELF-ADDRESSED, POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE IS ENCLOSED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.

Portfolio Turnover (% of average value of portfolio). The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example above, affect the Fund's performance.

* This portfolio turnover rate is for the JNL/Mellon Capital European 30 Fund.
Principal Investment Strategies.The Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the component securities ("Component Securities") of the RAFI Fundamental Europe Index (the "Index"). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in cash, securities, and instruments that are not Component Securities but which Mellon Corporation, the Fund's sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"), believes will help the Fund track its Index. The Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all or substantially all of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index. Indexing may offer a cost-effective investment approach to gaining diversified market exposure over the long-term. 
The Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed European countries. A company's eligibility for the universe is determined by the company's relative size based on its fundamental weight, calculated using adjusted sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks, and book value. 
As of September 30, 2018, the Index consisted of 414 Component Securities. The Index is reconstituted annually and rebalanced on a quarterly staggered basis on the last business day of March, June, and September and the third Friday of December. The Index is split into four equal parts (tranches), and each tranche has equal weight at the March rebalance. Each tranche is rebalanced once a year to target weights determined for that quarter.
The Sub-Adviser uses a "passive" or "indexing" approach to try to achieve the Fund's investment objective. The Fund does not employ traditional methods of active investment management, which involves the buying and selling of securities based upon security analysis. 
The Fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") to assist with index rebalances and to meet redemption or purchase requests. The Fund's holdings are rebalanced on a regular basis to reflect changes in the composition of the Index.
The Fund may invest, without limitation, in equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred securities, from developed European countries. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements.
The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Europe Index. 
The Fund selects 30 securities from the MSCI Europe Index, based on screens evaluating volatility, efficiency of company management, and a valuation-to-price ratio. The securities are placed into 1 of the 4 following country groupings:
Each country grouping represents 25% of the Fund. The securities selected are equal weighted in the Fund.
The 30 securities are selected once annually on the Security Selection Date. The Security Selection Date will be on or about January 1of each year.
BNY Mellon Asset Management North America Corporation ("BNYM AMNA" or "Sub-Adviser") generally uses a buy and hold strategy, trading only on or around each Security Selection Date, when cash flow activity occurs in the Fund, and for dividend reinvestment purposes. The Sub-Adviser may also trade for mergers if the original security included in the Fund's portfolio is not the surviving security.
Certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act") and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may limit the ability of the Fund to invest in certain securities in excess of certain percentage limitations.
The Fund may invest in a combination of exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") to assist with fund rebalances and to meet redemption or purchase requests.
The Fund may invest in financial futures, a type of derivative, to obtain market exposure consistent with the Fund's investment objective and strategies, to provide liquidity for cash flows, to hedge dividend accruals or for other purposes that facilitate meeting the Fund's objective. In addition, the Fund may use foreign currency forward contracts, a type of derivative, to maintain appropriate currency exposures.
The Fund is a "non-diversified" fund, as defined in the 1940, and may invest more of its assets in fewer issuers than "diversified" mutual funds.
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed. As with any mutual fund, the value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. The principal risks associated with investing in the Fund include:
Performance. The performance information shown provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compared with those of a broad-based securities market index which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. Performance prior to June 24 , 2019 reflects the Fund's results when the Fund's principal investment strategies were different, and the Fund tracked the MSCI Europe Index (Net). Effective June 24 , 2019, for consistency with the Fund's principal investment strategies, the Fund's primary benchmark, the MSCI Europe Index (Net), was replaced with the RAFI Fundamental Europe Index ( Gross ). The Fund's past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.   The RAFI Fundamental Europe Index (Gross) represents the total return of the index over the applicable periods (total return assumes no taxation of foreign dividends whereas Fund shareholders would experience taxation of foreign dividends). 
Portfolio Management.
Investment Adviser to the Fund:   Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
Sub-Adviser:  Mellon Investments Corporation (" Mellon ") BNY Mellon Asset Management North America Corporation
Portfolio Managers:
Purchase and Redemption of Fund Shares 
Only separate accounts of Jackson National Life Insurance Company ("Jackson") or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York ("Jackson NY") and series, including fund of funds, of registered investment companies in which either or both of those insurance companies invest may purchase shares of the Fund. You may invest indirectly in the Fund through your purchase of a variable annuity or life insurance contract issued by a separate account of Jackson or Jackson NY that invests directly, or through a fund of funds, in this Fund. Any minimum initial or subsequent investment requirements and redemption procedures are governed by the applicable separate account through which you invest indirectly.
This Fund serves as an underlying investment by insurance companies, affiliated investment companies, and retirement plans for funding variable annuity and life insurance contracts and retirement plans.
Tax Information
The Fund's shareholders are separate accounts of Jackson or Jackson NY and mutual funds owned directly or indirectly by such separate accounts. Accordingly, the Fund's dividends and other distributions generally are not taxable to you, the contract owner or plan participant, but no further discussion is included about the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you. You should consult the prospectus of the appropriate separate account or description of the plan for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of your contract, policy or plan.
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Financial Intermediaries
If you invest in the Fund under a variable insurance contract or a plan that offers a variable insurance contract as a plan option through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a financial institution), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's Website for more information.

The Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed European countries.
The universe for the Index construction process starts with all common equity securities traded on primary exchanges, which meet and pass minimum liquidity and investability (capacity) requirements, issued by companies that are assigned to the developed European countries by the Index Provider. The Index Provider assigns companies to countries and promulgates that assignment to securities. Eligible securities are then determined by selecting companies based on fundamental weight, calculated using four accounting measures from company financial statements: (i) de-levered sales, calculated as company sales averaged over the past five years multiplied by the ratio of average equity to average assets; (ii) cash flow, taken as the company operating cash flow averaged over the past five years; (iii) dividends plus buybacks, calculated using the average dividends paid and share buybacks over the past five years; and (iv) book value, taken as the most recent company book value.
As of September 30, 2018, the Index consisted of 414 Component Securities. The Index is reconstituted annually and rebalanced on a quarterly staggered basis on the last business day of March, June, and September and the third Friday of December.

The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Europe Index. 
The 30 securities are selected once annually on the Security Selection Date. The Security Selection Date is on or about January 1 of each year. BNY Mellon Asset Management North America Corporation ("BNYM AMNA" or "Sub-Adviser") generally uses a buy and hold strategy, trading only on or around each Security Selection Date, when cash flow activity occurs in the Fund, and for dividend reinvestment purposes. The Sub-Adviser may also trade for mergers if the original security is not the surviving security.
As of December 31, 2017, the MSCI Europe Index consists of securities from the following 15 developed markets: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The population of securities is divided into the following country groupings:
Each country grouping represents 25% of the Fund. The securities selected are equally weighted in the Fund.
The 30 securities are selected by applying the following analysis to each group on each Security Selection Date:
Between Security Selection Dates, when cash inflows and outflows require, the Sub-Adviser makes new purchases and sales of stocks of the 30 selected securities in approximately the same proportion that such securities are then held in the Fund (determined based on market value).
The EBO valuation model provides an indication of the value of the equity securities by measuring the anticipated future production of income by that security after taking into account that security's cost of equity. EBO valuation analysis is similar to discounted cash flow analysis, except that the EBO model relies on the measurement of residual income while discounted cash flow analysis relies on the measurement of free cash flow.
Securities, which as of the Security Selection Date, MSCI has announced will be removed from the MSCI Europe Index, will be removed from the universe of securities from which the Fund's securities are selected.
MSCI country constituency is subject to change, and only countries in the MSCI Europe Index on the Security Selection Date are eligible for stock selection.
Certain provisions of the 1940 Act, limit the ability of the Fund to invest more than 25% of the Fund's total assets in a particular industry ("25% limitation"). If a security is selected which would cause the Fund to exceed the 25% limitation, the Sub-Adviser may depart from the Fund's investment strategy only to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with the 25% limitation. Any amount that cannot be allocated to a particular industry because of the 25% limitation will be allocated among the remaining portfolio securities.
The Fund may invest in a combination of exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") to assist with fund re-balances and to meet redemption or purchase requests.
The Fund may invest in financial futures, a type of derivative, to obtain exposure, to provide liquidity for cash flows, to hedge dividend accruals or for other purposes that facilitate meeting the Fund's objective. In addition, the Fund may use foreign currency forward contracts, a type of derivative, to maintain appropriate currency exposures.
The Fund is a "non-diversified" fund, as defined in the 1940 Act, and may invest more of its assets in fewer issuers than "diversified" mutual funds.

Principal Investment Strategies. The Fund invests, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the component securities ("Component Securities") of the RAFI Fundamental Asia Developed Index (the "Index"). The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in cash, securities, and instruments that are not Component Securities but which Mellon Investments Corporation, the Fund's sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"), believes will help the Fund track its Index. The Fund attempts to replicate the Index by investing all or substantially all of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index. Indexing may offer a cost-effective investment approach to gaining diversified market exposure over the long-term. 
The Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed Asian countries. A company's eligibility for the universe is determined by the company's relative size based on its fundamental weight, calculated using adjusted sales, cash flow, dividends and buybacks, and book value. 
As of September 30, 2018, the Index consisted of 755 Component Securities. The Index is reconstituted annually and rebalanced on a quarterly staggered basis on the last business day of March, June, and September and the third Friday of December. The Index is split into four equal parts (tranches), and each tranche has equal weight at the March rebalance. Each tranche is rebalanced once a year to target weights determined for that quarter.
The Sub-Adviser uses a "passive" or "indexing" approach to try to achieve the Fund's investment objective. The Fund does not employ traditional methods of active investment management, which involves the buying and selling of securities based upon security analysis. 
The Fund may also invest in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") to assist with index rebalances and to meet redemption or purchase requests. The Fund's holdings are rebalanced on a regular basis to reflect changes in the composition of the Index.
The Fund may invest, without limitation, in equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred securities, from developed Asian countries. The Fund may also invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements.
The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus the amount of any borrowings made for investment purposes) in the securities of 30 companies selected from the MSCI Pacific Index.
The Fund selects 30 securities from the MSCI Pacific Index, based on screens evaluating volatility, efficiency of company management, and a valuation-to-price ratio. Half of the securities selected come from Japan, and the other half of the securities may come from Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Singapore. The securities selected are equal weighted in the Fund.
The 30 securities are selected once annually on the Security Selection Date. The next Security Selection Date will be on or about January 1 of each year. 
BNY Mellon Asset Management North America Corporation ("BNYM AMNA" or "Sub-Adviser") generally uses a buy and hold strategy, trading only on or around each Security Selection Date, when cash flow activity occurs in the Fund, and for dividend reinvestment purposes. The Sub-Adviser may also trade for mergers if the original security included in the Fund's portfolio is not the surviving security.
Certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940") Act and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the ability of the Fund to invest in certain securities in excess of certain percentage limitations.
The Fund may invest in a combination of exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") to assist with fund rebalances and to meet redemption or purchase requests.
The Fund may invest in financial futures, a type of derivative, to obtain exposure, to provide liquidity for cash flows, to hedge dividend accruals or for other purposes that facilitate meeting the Fund's objective. In addition, the Fund may use foreign currency forward contracts, a type of derivative, to maintain appropriate currency exposures.
The Fund is a "non-diversified" fund, as defined in the 1940 Act, and may invest more of its assets in fewer issuers than "diversified" mutual funds.
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed. As with any mutual fund, the value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. The principal risks associated with investing in the Fund include:
Performance. The performance information shown provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compared with those of a broad-based securities market index which has investment characteristics similar to those of the Fund. Performance prior to June 24 , 2019 reflects the Fund's results when the Fund's principal investment strategies were different, and the Fund tracked the MSCI Pacific Index (Net). Effective June 24 , 2019, for consistency with the Fund's principal investment strategies, the Fund's primary benchmark, the MSCI Pacific Index (Net), was replaced with the RAFI Fundamental Asia Developed Index ( Gross ). The Fund's past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.   The RAFI Fundamental Asia Developed Index (Gross) represents the total return of the index over the applicable periods (total return assumes no taxation of foreign dividends whereas Fund shareholders would experience taxation of foreign dividends). 
 Effective June 24, 2019, for consistency with the Fund's principal investment strategies, the Fund has included the MSCI Pacific Index (Net) as its secondary benchmark. 
The returns shown in the bar chart and table do not include charges that will be imposed by variable insurance products. If these amounts were reflected, returns would be less than those shown.
Portfolio Management.
Investment Adviser to the Fund:   Jackson National Asset Management, LLC
Sub-Adviser: Mellon Investments Corporation ("Mellon") BNY Mellon Asset Management North America Corporation
Portfolio Managers:
Purchase and Redemption of Fund Shares 
Only separate accounts of Jackson National Life Insurance Company ("Jackson") or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York ("Jackson NY") and series, including fund of funds, of registered investment companies in which either or both of those insurance companies invest may purchase shares of the Fund. You may invest indirectly in the Fund through your purchase of a variable annuity or life insurance contract issued by a separate account of Jackson or Jackson NY that invests directly, or through a fund of funds, in this Fund. Any minimum initial or subsequent investment requirements and redemption procedures are governed by the applicable separate account through which you invest indirectly.
This Fund serves as an underlying investment by insurance companies, affiliated investment companies, and retirement plans for funding variable annuity and life insurance contracts and retirement plans.
Tax Information
The Fund's shareholders are separate accounts of Jackson or Jackson NY and mutual funds owned directly or indirectly by such separate accounts. Accordingly, the Fund's dividends and other distributions generally are not taxable to you, the contract owner or plan participant, but no further discussion is included about the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you. You should consult the prospectus of the appropriate separate account or description of the plan for a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of your contract, policy or plan.
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Financial Intermediaries
If you invest in the Fund under a variable insurance contract or a plan that offers a variable insurance contract as a plan option through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a financial institution), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's Website for more information.

The Index is constructed by RAFI Indices, LLC (the "Index Provider"). The Index Provider uses a fundamental weighting approach to construct the Index, which includes a diversified universe of securities from developed Asian countries.
The universe for the Index construction process starts with all common equity securities traded on primary exchanges, which meet and pass minimum liquidity and investability (capacity) requirements, issued by companies that are assigned to the developed Asian countries by the Index Provider. The Index Provider assigns companies to countries and promulgates that assignment to securities. Eligible securities are then determined by selecting companies based on fundamental weight, calculated using four accounting measures from company financial statements: (i) de-levered sales, calculated as company sales averaged over the past five years multiplied by the ratio of average equity to average assets; (ii) cash flow, taken as the company operating cash flow averaged over the past five years; (iii) dividends plus buybacks, calculated using the average dividends paid and share buybacks over the past five years; and (iv) book value, taken as the most recent company book value.
As of September 30, 2018, the Index consisted of 755 Component Securities. The Index is reconstituted annually and rebalanced on a quarterly staggered basis on the last business day of March, June, and September and the third Friday of December.

The Sub-Adviser may also trade for mergers if the original security is not the surviving security.
As of December 31, 2017, the MSCI Pacific Index consisted of the following 5 developed market countries: Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore. The population of securities is divided into the following country groupings:
Half of the securities selected come from Japan, and the other half of the securities may come from Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Singapore. The securities selected are equally weighted in the Fund.
