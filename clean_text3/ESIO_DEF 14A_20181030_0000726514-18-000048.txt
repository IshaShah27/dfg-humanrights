Letter to ESI Employees from ESI CEO 
TO:          ESI Employees
FROM:      Michael Burger (President & CEO)
DATE:        October 30, 2018
SUBJECT:      Agreement for MKS Instruments to Acquire Electro Scientific Industries, Inc. (ESI)
Dear Employees:
Today we announced that we have entered into an agreement to be acquired by MKS Instruments (NASDAQ: MKSI) for $30.00 per share in cash.  This acquisition will bring together two leading global suppliers of instruments, components and systems focused on similar markets and applications. 
ESI's core competencies are considered highly complementary to MKS' laser and photonics portfolio as well as their semiconductor products and applications.  MKS values the differentiated technologies, systems and customer relationships you have all built and they intend to continue to invest in these areas to enable new opportunities and growth for our customers and employees. 
MKS is a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, monitor, deliver, analyze, power and control critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity for their customers.  They also provide services relating to the maintenance and repair of their products, installation services and training. MKS' primary-served markets include semiconductor, industrial technologies, life and health sciences, research and defense, and it sees expansion into the printed circuit board market as a key strategic initiative.  As many of you know, MKS is currently a valued supplier of lasers, optical components and mechanical stages to ESI, and with this acquisition, ESI will enable them with a more direct path to market in this strategic market.
MKS was founded more than 55 years ago and is a publicly traded company with revenues of US$1.9 Billion in 2017.  MKS is headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, with over five thousand employees globally.  Additional information can be found at www.mksinst.com
On Thursday, November 1st, a representative of MKS' leadership will be on site in our Portland Headquarters for an ESI all hands employee meeting.  Please anticipate an invitation shortly. 
This transaction has been unanimously approved by the ESI and MKS boards of directors and is subject to ESI's shareholders approval, as well as other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.  We currently expect to close the transaction in the first calendar quarter of 2019.  While we work to close the transaction, it's critical that we maintain sharp focus on our own business objectives as well as our customers' satisfaction and goodwill.  Also, note that during this period we remain two separate companies, so please conduct business as usual until directed otherwise.
Please note that all external inquiries should be directed to Allen Muhich, ESI's CFO.
I'm very proud of the progress we've made as a team over the last two years.  This transaction and the value MKS is placing on our business is a testament to what we've been able to accomplish together.  Let's continue to deliver on our key objectives, through closing and into the future.  I truly appreciate your patience and continued support as we move forward to this new chapter in our company's future.
Best Regards,
Michael
