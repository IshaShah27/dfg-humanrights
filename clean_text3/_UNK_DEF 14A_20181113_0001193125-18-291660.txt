General Information 
This Joint Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Trustees or Directors (each a "Board" and collectively, the "Boards," and each Trustee or Director, a "Board Member" and collectively, the "Board Members") of each of Nuveen Arizona Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Arizona Quality"), Nuveen California AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund ("California AMT-Free"), Nuveen California Municipal Value Fund 2 ("California Value 2"), Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund ("California Quality), Nuveen Massachusetts Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Massachusetts Quality"), Nuveen Michigan Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Michigan Quality"), Nuveen New Jersey Quality Municipal Income Fund ("New Jersey Quality"), Nuveen New Jersey Municipal Value Fund ("New Jersey Value"), Nuveen Ohio Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Ohio Quality"), Nuveen Pennsylvania Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Pennsylvania Quality"), Nuveen Pennsylvania Municipal Value Fund ("Pennsylvania Value") and Nuveen Texas Quality Municipal Income Fund ("Texas Quality"), each a Massachusetts business trust (each, a "Massachusetts Fund" and collectively, the "Massachusetts Funds"), and Nuveen California Municipal Value Fund, Inc. ("California Value"), a Minnesota corporation (California Value and the Massachusetts Funds are each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds"), of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in the offices of Nuveen, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, on Tuesday, November 13, 2018 at 12:00 p.m., Central time (for each Fund, an "Annual Meeting" and collectively, the "Annual Meetings"), and at any and all adjournments thereof.  On the matters coming before each Annual Meeting as to which a choice has been specified by shareholders on the proxy, the shares will be voted accordingly. If a properly executed proxy is returned and no choice is specified, the shares will be voted FOR the election of the nominees as listed in this Joint Proxy Statement. Shareholders of a Fund who execute proxies may revoke them at any time before they are voted by filing with that Fund a written notice of revocation, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. A prior proxy can also be revoked by voting again through the toll-free number or the Internet address listed in the proxy card. Merely attending the Annual Meeting, however, will not revoke any previously submitted proxy. 
The Board of each Fund has determined that the use of this Joint Proxy Statement for each Annual Meeting is in the best interest of each Fund and its shareholders in light of the similar matters being considered and voted on by the shareholders. 
The following table indicates which shareholders are solicited with respect to each matter: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1(a)(i)   For each Massachusetts Fund (except California Value 2, New Jersey Value and Pennsylvania Value), election of three  (3) Class III Board Members by all shareholders.   X   X 
 1(a)(ii)   For each Massachusetts Fund (except California Value 2, New Jersey Value and Pennsylvania Value), election of two  (2) Board Members by holders of Preferred Shares only.       X

(1)  Variable Rate MuniFund Term Preferred Shares ("VMTP Shares") for Arizona Quality, Michigan Quality and Pennsylvania Quality; Variable Rate  Demand Preferred Shares ("VRDP Shares") for California AMT-Free, California Quality, Massachusetts Quality, New Jersey Quality, Ohio Quality and Pennsylvania Quality; and MuniFund Preferred Shares  ("MFP Shares") for California AMT-Free, California Quality and Texas Quality are collectively referred to herein as "Preferred Shares."  
[END TABLE]
A quorum of shareholders is required to take action at each Annual Meeting. A majority of the shares entitled to vote at each Annual Meeting, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum of shareholders at that Annual Meeting, except that for the election of the two Board Member nominees by holders of Preferred Shares (for each Fund except California Value, California Value 2, New Jersey Value and Pennsylvania Value), 33 1/3% of the Preferred Shares entitled to vote and represented in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum. Votes cast by proxy or in person at each Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for that Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees, typically in "street name," as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) as present for purposes of determining a quorum.  VRDP Shares held in "street name" as to which voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote as of one business day before the Annual Meeting, or, if adjourned, one business day before the day to which the Annual Meeting is adjourned, and that would otherwise be treated as "broker non-votes" may, pursuant to Rule 452 of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), be voted by the broker on the proposal in the same proportion as the votes cast by all holders of VRDP Shares as a class who have voted on the proposal or in the same proportion as the votes cast by all holders of VRDP Shares of the Fund who have voted on that item. Rule 452 permits proportionate voting of VRDP Shares with respect to a particular item if, among other things, (i) a minimum of 30% of the VRDP Shares or shares of a series of VRDP Shares outstanding has been voted by the holders of such shares with respect to such item, (ii) less than 10% of the VRDP Shares or shares of a series of VRDP Shares outstanding has been voted by the holders of such shares against such item and (iii) for any proposal as to which holders of Common Shares and Preferred Shares vote as a single class, holders of Common Shares approve the proposal. For the purpose of meeting the 30% test, abstentions will be treated as shares "voted" and, for the purpose of meeting the 10% test, abstentions will not be treated as shares "voted" against the item. 
Broker-dealers who are not members of the NYSE may be subject to other rules, which may or may not permit them to vote your shares without instruction. We urge you to provide instructions to your broker or nominee so that your votes may be counted. 
For each Fund, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to elect the Board Members of that Fund. For purposes of determining the approval of the proposal to elect Board Members for each Fund, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect. 
Those persons who were shareholders of record at the close of business on Monday, September 14, 2018 will be entitled to one vote for each share held and a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional vote held. As of September 14, 2018, the shares of the Funds were issued and outstanding as follows:

 Board Member Investments in the Funds 
In order to create an appropriate identity of interests between Board Members and shareholders, the Boards of Directors/Trustees of the Nuveen funds have adopted a governance principle pursuant to which each Board Member is expected to invest, either directly or on a deferred basis, at least the equivalent of one year of compensation in the funds in the Nuveen fund complex. 
The dollar range of equity securities beneficially owned by each Board Member in each Fund and all Nuveen funds overseen by the Board Member as of May 31, 2018 is set forth in Appendix A. The number of shares of each Fund beneficially owned by each Board Member and by the Board Members and officers of the Funds as a group as of May 31, 2018 is also set forth in Appendix A. On May 31, 2018, Board Members and executive officers as a group beneficially owned approximately 1.3 million shares of all funds managed by the Adviser (including shares held by the Board Members through the Deferred Compensation Plan for Independent Board Members and by executive officers in Nuveen's 401(k)/profit sharing plan). As of September 14, 2018, each Board Member's individual beneficial shareholdings of each Fund constituted less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the Fund. As of September 14, 2018, the Board Members and executive officers as a group beneficially owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of each Fund. As of September 14, 2018, no shareholder beneficially owned more than 5% of any class of shares of any Fund, except as provided in Appendix B. 
Compensation 
Prior to January 1, 2018, each Independent Board Member received a $177,500 annual retainer plus: (a) a fee of $5,750 per day for attendance in-person or by telephone at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board; (b) a fee of $3,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at special, non-regularly scheduled meetings of the Board where in-person attendance was required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance was not required; (c) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Audit Committee meetings where in-person attendance was required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance was not required; (d) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee meetings where in-person attendance was required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance was not required; (e) a fee of $1,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Dividend Committee meetings; (f) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Closed-End Funds Committee meetings where in-person attendance was required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance was not required; and (g) a fee of $500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at all other committee meetings ($1,000 for shareholder meetings) where in-person attendance was required and $250 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such committee meetings (excluding shareholder meetings) where in-person attendance was not required and $100 per meeting when the Executive Committee acted as pricing committee for IPOs, plus, in each case, expenses incurred in attending such meetings; provided that no fees were received for meetings held on days on which regularly scheduled Board meetings were held. In addition to the payments described above, the   Chairman of the Board received $80,000, the chairpersons of the Audit Committee, the Dividend Committee, the Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee, the Closed-End Funds Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee received $12,500 each as additional retainers. Independent Board Members also received a fee of $3,000 per day for site visits to entities that provided services to the Nuveen funds on days on which no Board meeting was held. When ad hoc committees were organized, the Nominating and Governance Committee would at the time of formation determine compensation to be paid to the members of such committee; however, in general, such fees were $1,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at ad hoc committee meetings where in-person attendance was required and $500 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance was not required. The annual retainer, fees and expenses were allocated among the Nuveen funds on the basis of relative net assets, although management may, in its discretion, have established a minimum amount to be allocated to each fund. In certain instances fees and expenses were allocated only to those Nuveen funds that were discussed at a given meeting. 
Effective January 1, 2018, each Independent Board Member receives a $185,000 annual retainer plus: (a) a fee of $6,000 per day for attendance in-person or by telephone at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board; (b) a fee of $3,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at special, non-regularly scheduled meetings of the Board where in-person attendance is required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance is not required; (c) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Audit Committee meetings where in-person attendance is required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance is not required; (d) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee meetings where in-person attendance is required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance is not required; (e) a fee of $1,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Dividend Committee meetings; (f) a fee of $2,500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at Closed-End Funds Committee meetings where in-person attendance is required and $2,000 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance is not required; and (g) a fee of $500 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at all other committee meetings ($1,000 for shareholder meetings) where in-person attendance is required and $250 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such committee meetings (excluding shareholder meetings) where in-person attendance is not required, and $100 per meeting when the Executive Committee acts as pricing committee for IPOs, plus, in each case, expenses incurred in attending such meetings; provided that no fees are received for meetings held on days on which regularly scheduled Board meetings are held. In addition to the payments described above, the Chairman of the Board receives $90,000 and the chairpersons of the Audit Committee, the Dividend Committee, the Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee, the Closed-End Funds Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee receive $12,500 each as additional retainers. Independent Board Members also receive a fee of $3,000 per day for site visits to entities that provide services to the Nuveen funds on days on which no Board meeting is held. When ad hoc committees are organized, the Nominating and Governance Committee will at the time of formation determine compensation to be paid to the members of such committee; however, in general, such fees will be $1,000 per meeting for attendance in-person or by telephone at   ad hoc committee meetings where in-person attendance is required and $500 per meeting for attendance by telephone or in-person at such meetings where in-person attendance is not required. The annual retainer, fees and expenses are allocated among the Nuveen funds on the basis of relative net assets, although management may, in its discretion, establish a minimum amount to be allocated to each fund. In certain instances fees and expenses will be allocated only to those Nuveen funds that are discussed at a given meeting. 
The Funds do not have retirement or pension plans. Certain Nuveen funds (the "Participating Funds") participate in a deferred compensation plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") that permits an Independent Board Member to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of his or her compensation as an Independent Board Member. The deferred compensation of a participating Independent Board Member is credited to a book reserve account of the Participating Fund when the compensation would otherwise have been paid to such Independent Board Member. The value of an Independent Board Member's deferral account at any time is equal to the value that the account would have had if contributions to the account had been invested and reinvested in shares of one or more of the eligible Nuveen funds. At the time for commencing distributions from an Independent Board Member's deferral account, the Independent Board Member may elect to receive distributions in a lump sum or over a period of five years. The Participating Fund will not be liable for any other fund's obligations to make distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
The Funds have no employees. The officers of the Funds and the Board Members of each Fund who are not Independent Board Members serve without any compensation from the Funds.  The table below shows, for each Independent Board Member, the aggregate compensation paid by each Fund to the Independent Board Member/nominee for its last fiscal year.

 Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
The Board of each Fund oversees the operations and management of the Fund, including the duties performed for the Fund by the Adviser. The Board has adopted a unitary board structure. A unitary board consists of one group of board members who serves on the board of every fund in the complex. In adopting a unitary board structure, the Board Members seek to provide effective governance through establishing a board, the overall composition of which will, as a body, possess the appropriate skills, independence and experience to oversee the Funds' business. With this overall framework in mind, when the Board, through its Nominating and Governance Committee discussed below, seeks nominees for the Board, the Board Members consider, not only the candidate's particular background, skills and experience, among other things, but also whether such background, skills and experience enhance the Board's diversity and at the same time complement the Board given its current composition and the mix of skills and experiences of the incumbent Board Members. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that the Board generally benefits from diversity of background, experience and views among its members, and considers this a factor in evaluating the composition of the Board, but has not adopted any specific policy on diversity or any particular definition of diversity. 
The Board believes the unitary board structure enhances good and effective governance, particularly given the nature of the structure of the investment company complex. Funds in the same complex generally are served by the same service providers and personnel and are governed by the same regulatory scheme which raises common issues that must be addressed by the Board Members across the fund complex (such as compliance, valuation, liquidity, brokerage, trade allocation or risk management). The Board believes it is more efficient to have a single board review and oversee common policies and procedures which increases the Board's knowledge and expertise with respect to the many aspects of fund operations that are complex-wide in nature. The unitary structure also enhances the Board's influence and oversight over the Adviser and other service providers. 
In an effort to enhance the independence of the Board, the Board also has a Chairman that is an Independent Board Member. The Board recognizes that a chairman can perform an important role in setting the agenda for the Board, establishing the boardroom culture, establishing a point person on behalf of the Board for Fund management, and reinforcing the Board's focus on the long-term interests of shareholders. The Board recognizes that a chairman may be able to better perform these functions without any conflicts of interests arising from a position with Fund management. Accordingly, the Board Members have elected Terence J. Toth as the independent Chairman of the Board. Specific responsibilities of the Chairman include: (i) presiding at all meetings of the Board and of the shareholders; (ii) seeing that all orders and resolutions of the Board Members are carried into effect; and (iii) maintaining records of and, whenever necessary, certifying all proceedings of the Board Members and the shareholders. 
Although the Board has direct responsibility over various matters (such as advisory contracts, underwriting contracts and Fund performance), the Board also exercises certain of its oversight responsibilities through several committees that it has established and which report back to the full Board. The Board believes that a committee structure is an effective means to permit Board Members to focus on particular operations or issues affecting the Funds, including risk oversight. More specifically, with respect to risk oversight, the Board has delegated   matters relating to valuation and compliance to certain committees (as summarized below) as well as certain aspects of investment risk. In addition, the Board believes that the periodic rotation of Board Members among the different committees allows the Board Members to gain additional and different perspectives of a Fund's operations. The Board has established six standing committees: the Executive Committee, the Dividend Committee, the Audit Committee, the Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Closed-End Funds Committee. The Board may also from time to time create ad hoc committees to focus on particular issues as the need arises. The membership and functions of the standing committees are summarized below. 
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee, which meets between regular meetings of the Board, is authorized to exercise all of the powers of the Board. The members of the Executive Committee are Terence J. Toth, Chair, Margo L. Cook and William J. Schneider. The number of Executive Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. 
Dividend Committee. The Dividend Committee is authorized to declare distributions on each Fund's shares including, but not limited to, regular and special dividends, capital gains and ordinary income distributions. The members of the Dividend Committee are William C. Hunter, Chair, Albin F. Moschner, Terence J. Toth and Margaret L. Wolff. The number of Dividend Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. 
Audit Committee. The Board has an Audit Committee, in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("1934 Act"), that is composed of Independent Board Members who are also "independent" as that term is defined in the listing standards pertaining to closed-end funds of the NYSE. The Audit Committee assists the Board in: the oversight and monitoring of the accounting and reporting policies, processes and practices of the Funds, and the audits of the financial statements of the Funds; the quality and integrity of the financial statements of the Funds; the Funds' compliance with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the Funds' financial statements; the independent auditors' qualifications, performance and independence; and the pricing procedures of the Funds and the internal valuation group of Nuveen. It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to select, evaluate and replace any independent auditors (subject only to Board and, if applicable, shareholder ratification) and to determine their compensation. The Audit Committee is also responsible for, among other things, overseeing the valuation of securities comprising the Funds' portfolios. Subject to the Board's general supervision of such actions, the Audit Committee addresses any valuation issues, oversees the Funds' pricing procedures and actions taken by Nuveen's internal valuation group which provides regular reports to the Audit Committee, reviews any issues relating to the valuation of the Funds' securities brought to its attention, and considers the risks to the Funds in assessing the possible resolutions of these matters. The Audit Committee may also consider any financial risk exposures for the Funds in conjunction with performing its functions. 
To fulfill its oversight duties, the Audit Committee receives annual and semi-annual reports and has regular meetings with the external auditors for the Funds and the internal audit group at Nuveen. The Audit Committee also may review, in a general manner, the processes the Board or other Board committees have in place with respect to risk assessment and risk management as well as compliance with legal and regulatory matters relating to the Funds' financial statements. The Audit Committee operates under a written Audit Committee Charter (the "Charter") adopted and approved by the Board, which Charter conforms to the listing   standards of the NYSE. Members of the Audit Committee are independent (as set forth in the Charter) and free of any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board Members, would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment as an Audit Committee member. The members of the Audit Committee are Jack B. Evans, Chair, William C. Hunter, John K. Nelson, Carole E. Stone and Terence J. Toth, each of whom is an Independent Board Member of the Funds. A copy of the Charter is available at www.nuveen.com/CEF/Shareholder/FundGovernance.aspx. The number of Audit Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. 
Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee. The Compliance, Risk Management and Regulatory Oversight Committee (the "Compliance Committee") is responsible for the oversight of compliance issues, risk management and other regulatory matters affecting the Funds that are not otherwise under or within the jurisdiction of the other committees. The Board has adopted and periodically reviews policies and procedures designed to address the Funds' compliance and risk matters. As part of its duties, the Compliance Committee: reviews the policies and procedures relating to compliance matters and recommends modifications thereto as necessary or appropriate to the full Board; develops new policies and procedures as new regulatory matters affecting the Funds arise from time to time; evaluates or considers any comments or reports from examinations from regulatory authorities and responses thereto; and performs any special reviews, investigations or other oversight responsibilities relating to risk management, compliance and/or regulatory matters as requested by the Board. 
In addition, the Compliance Committee is responsible for risk oversight, including, but not limited to, the oversight of risks related to investments and operations. Such risks include, among other things, exposures to: particular issuers, market sectors, or types of securities; risks related to product structure elements, such as leverage; and techniques that may be used to address those risks, such as hedging and swaps. In assessing issues brought to the Compliance Committee's attention or in reviewing a particular policy, procedure, investment technique or strategy, the Compliance Committee evaluates the risks to the Funds in adopting a particular approach or resolution compared to the anticipated benefits to the Funds and their shareholders. In fulfilling its obligations, the Compliance Committee meets on a quarterly basis, and at least once a year in-person. The Compliance Committee receives written and oral reports from the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") and meets privately with the CCO at each of its quarterly meetings. The CCO also provides an annual report to the full Board regarding the operations of the Funds' and other service providers' compliance programs as well as any recommendations for modifications thereto. The Compliance Committee also receives reports from the investment services group of Nuveen regarding various investment risks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the full Board also participates in discussions with management regarding certain matters relating to investment risk, such as the use of leverage and hedging. The investment services group therefore also reports to the full Board at its quarterly meetings regarding, among other things, Fund performance and the various drivers of such performance. Accordingly, the Board directly and/or in conjunction with the Compliance Committee oversees matters relating to investment risks. Matters not addressed at the committee level are addressed directly by the full Board. The Compliance Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board. The members of the Compliance Committee are John K. Nelson, Chair, Albin F. Moschner, Judith M. Stockdale, Margaret L. Wolff and Robert L. Young. The number of Compliance Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C.  Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for seeking, identifying and recommending to the Board qualified candidates for election or appointment to the Board. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees matters of corporate governance, including the evaluation of Board performance and processes, the assignment and rotation of committee members, and the establishment of corporate governance guidelines and procedures, to the extent necessary or desirable, and matters related thereto. Although the unitary and committee structure has been developed over the years and the Nominating and Governance Committee believes the structure has provided efficient and effective governance, the Nominating and Governance Committee recognizes that, as demands on the Board evolve over time (such as through an increase in the number of funds overseen or an increase in the complexity of the issues raised), the Nominating and Governance Committee must continue to evaluate the Board and committee structures and their processes and modify the foregoing as may be necessary or appropriate to continue to provide effective governance. Accordingly, the Nominating and Governance Committee has a separate meeting each year to, among other things, review the Board and committee structures, their performance and functions, and recommend any modifications thereto or alternative structures or processes that would enhance the Board's governance over the Funds' business. 
In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee, among other things: makes recommendations concerning the continuing education of Board Members; monitors performance of legal counsel and other service providers; establishes and monitors a process by which security holders are able to communicate in writing with Board Members; and periodically reviews and makes recommendations about any appropriate changes to Board Member compensation. In the event of a vacancy on the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee receives suggestions from various sources, including shareholders, as to suitable candidates. Suggestions should be sent in writing to William Siffermann, Manager of Fund Board Relations, Nuveen, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. The Nominating and Governance Committee sets appropriate standards and requirements for nominations for new Board Members and each nominee is evaluated using the same standards. However, the Nominating and Governance Committee reserves the right to interview any and all candidates and to make the final selection of any new Board Members. In considering a candidate's qualifications, each candidate must meet certain basic requirements, including relevant skills and experience, time availability (including the time requirements for due diligence site visits to internal and external sub-advisers and service providers) and, if qualifying as an Independent Board Member candidate, independence from the Adviser, sub-advisers, underwriters or other service providers, including any affiliates of these entities. These skill and experience requirements may vary depending on the current composition of the Board, since the goal is to ensure an appropriate range of skills, diversity and experience, in the aggregate. Accordingly, the particular factors considered and weight given to these factors will depend on the composition of the Board and the skills and backgrounds of the incumbent Board Members at the time of consideration of the nominees. All candidates, however, must meet high expectations of personal integrity, independence, governance experience and professional competence. All candidates must be willing to be critical within the Board and with management and yet maintain a collegial and collaborative manner toward other Board Members. The Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Funds' website at www.nuveen.com/CEF/Shareholder/FundGovernance.aspx, and is composed entirely of Independent Board Members, who are also "independent" as   defined by NYSE listing standards. The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are Terence J. Toth, Chair, Jack B. Evans, William C. Hunter, Albin F. Moschner, John K. Nelson, William J. Schneider, Judith M. Stockdale, Carole E. Stone, Margaret L. Wolff and Robert L. Young. The number of Nominating and Governance Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. 
Closed-End Funds Committee. The Closed-End Funds Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in the oversight and monitoring of the Nuveen funds that are registered as closed-end management investment companies ("Closed-End Funds"). The Closed-End Funds Committee may review and evaluate matters related to the formation and the initial presentation to the Board of any new Closed-End Fund and may review and evaluate any matters relating to any existing Closed-End Fund. The Closed-End Funds Committee operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board. The members of the Closed-End Funds Committee are Carole E. Stone, Chair, Margo L. Cook, Jack B. Evans, Albin F. Moschner, Terence J. Toth and Robert L. Young. The number of Closed-End Funds Committee meetings of each Fund held during its last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. 
Board Member Attendance. The number of regular quarterly meetings and special meetings held by the Board of each Fund during the Fund's last fiscal year is shown in Appendix C. During the last fiscal year, each Board Member attended 75% or more of each Fund's Board meetings and the committee meetings (if a member thereof) held during the period for which such Board Member was a Board Member. The policy of the Board relating to attendance by Board Members at annual meetings of shareholders of the Funds and the number of Board Members who attended the last annual meeting of shareholders of each Fund is posted on the Funds' website at www.nuveen.com/CEF/Shareholder/FundGovernance.aspx. 
Board Diversification and Board Member Qualifications. In determining that a particular Board Member was qualified to serve on the Board, the Board considered each Board Member's background, skills, experience and other attributes in light of the composition of the Board with no particular factor controlling. The Board believes that Board Members need to have the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with Fund management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties, and the Board believes each Board Member satisfies this standard. An effective Board Member may achieve this ability through his or her educational background; business, professional training or practice; public service or academic positions; experience from service as a board member or executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other life experiences. Accordingly, set forth below is a summary of the experiences, qualifications, attributes, and skills that led to the conclusion, as of the date of this document, that each Board Member should serve in that capacity. References to the experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of Board Members are pursuant to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), do not constitute holding out the Board or any Board Member as having any special expertise or experience and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of each Board is responsible for the oversight and monitoring of (1) the accounting and reporting policies, processes and practices, and the audit of the financial statements, of each Fund, (2) the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements and   (3) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence. In its oversight capacity, the Audit Committee reviews each Fund's annual financial statements with both management and the independent registered public accounting firm and the Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors to consider their evaluation of each Fund's financial and internal controls. The Audit Committee also selects, retains, evaluates and may replace each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is currently composed of five Independent Board Members and operates under a written charter adopted and approved by each Board. Each Audit Committee member meets the independence and experience requirements, as applicable, of the NYSE, Section 10A of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
The Audit Committee, in discharging its duties, has met with and held discussions with management and each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has also reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. Management has represented to the independent registered public accounting firm that each Fund's financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards ("SAS") No. 114 (The Auditor's Communication With Those Charged With Governance), which supersedes SAS No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees). Each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosure required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), and the Audit Committee discussed with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm their firm's independence. As provided in the Audit Committee Charter, it is not the Audit Committee's responsibility to determine, and the considerations and discussions referenced above do not ensure, that each Fund's financial statements are complete and accurate and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the representations of management and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee has recommended that the audited financial statements be included in each Fund's Annual Report. 
The current members of the Audit Committee are: 
Jack B. Evans 
William C. Hunter 
John K. Nelson 
Carole E. Stone 
Terence J. Toth  Audit and Related Fees. The following tables provide the aggregate fees billed during each Fund's last two fiscal years by each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for engagements directly related to the operations and financial reporting of each Fund including those relating (i) to each Fund for services provided to the Fund and (ii) to the Adviser and certain entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provide ongoing services to each Fund ("Adviser Entities").

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit Committee must approve each Fund's independent registered public accounting firm's engagements (i) with the Fund for audit or non-audit services and (ii) with the Adviser and Adviser Entities for non-audit services if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund.

Additional Information 
Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of each Fund has appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books and records of the Fund for its current fiscal year. A representative of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meetings to make a statement, if such representative so desires, and to respond to shareholders' questions. KPMG has informed each Fund that it has no direct or indirect material financial interest in the Funds, Nuveen, the Adviser or any other investment company sponsored by Nuveen. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Interest Reporting Compliance 
Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act and Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act require Board Members and officers, the Adviser, affiliated persons of the Adviser and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of a Fund's equity securities to file forms reporting their affiliation with that Fund and reports of ownership and changes in ownership of that Fund's shares with the SEC and the NYSE, as applicable. These persons and entities are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Funds with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on a review of these forms furnished to each Fund, each Fund believes that its Board Members and officers, Adviser and affiliated persons of the Adviser have complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements during its last fiscal year. To the knowledge of management of the Funds, no shareholder of a Fund owns more than 10% of a registered class of a Fund's equity securities, except as provided in Appendix B.

The Adviser, located at 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, serves as investment adviser and manager for each Fund. The Adviser is an indirect subsidiary of Nuveen, LLC, the investment management arm of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America ("TIAA"). TIAA is a life insurance company founded in 1918 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and is the companion organization of College Retirement Equities Fund.

A shareholder wishing to provide notice in the manner prescribed by Rule 14a-4(c)(1) of a proposal submitted outside of the process of Rule 14a-8 for the annual meeting must, pursuant to each Fund's By-Laws, submit such written notice to the Fund not later than August 26, 2019 or prior to August 11, 2019. Timely submission of a proposal does not mean that such proposal will be included in a proxy statement. 
Shareholder Communications 
Fund shareholders who want to communicate with the Board or any individual Board Member should write to the attention of William Siffermann, Manager of Fund Board Relations, Nuveen, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. The letter should indicate that you are a Fund shareholder and note the Fund or Funds that you own. If the communication is intended for a specific Board Member and so indicates, it will be sent only to that Board Member. If a communication does not indicate a specific Board Member, it will be sent to the Independent Chairman and the outside counsel to the Independent Board Members for further distribution as deemed appropriate by such persons. 
Expenses of Proxy Solicitation 
The cost of preparing, printing and mailing the enclosed proxy, accompanying notice and proxy statement and all other costs in connection with the solicitation of proxies will be paid by the Funds pro rata based on the number of shareholder accounts. Additional solicitation may be made by letter or telephone by officers or employees of Nuveen or the Adviser, or by dealers and their representatives. Any additional costs of solicitation will be paid by the Fund that requires additional solicitation.

For more information, shareholders may also contact the applicable Fund at the address and phone number set forth above.  Please note that only one annual report, semi-annual report or proxy statement may be delivered to two or more shareholders of a Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary.

General 
Management does not intend to present and does not have reason to believe that any other items of business will be presented at the Annual Meetings. However, if other matters are properly presented to the Annual Meetings for a vote, the proxies will be voted by the persons acting under the proxies upon such matters in accordance with their judgment of the best interests of the Fund. 
A list of shareholders entitled to be present and to vote at each Annual Meeting will be available at the offices of the Funds, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois, for inspection by any shareholder during regular business hours beginning ten days prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. 
Failure of a quorum to be present at any Annual Meeting will necessitate adjournment and will subject that Fund to additional expense. The persons named in the enclosed proxy may also move for an adjournment of any Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to the proposal if they determine that adjournment and further solicitation is reasonable and in the best interests of the Funds. Under each Fund's By-Laws, an adjournment of a meeting with respect to a matter requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the matter present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. 
IF YOU CANNOT BE PRESENT AT THE MEETING, YOU ARE REQUESTED TO FILL IN, SIGN AND RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY PROMPTLY. NO POSTAGE IS REQUIRED IF MAILED IN THE UNITED STATES.
