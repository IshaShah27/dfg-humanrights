The St. Regis Houston

Houston, Texas Dear Shareholder: 
Please join Noble Energy's Board of Directors, executive management team, employees and alumni at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement will serve as your guide to the business to be conducted at the meeting.
In 2018, we made significant progress on our portfolio transformation and maintained our focus on delivering long-term shareholder value despite market and commodity price volatility.  We grew our U.S. onshore business and entered 2019 focused on capital efficiency and returns.  Offshore, our world class Leviathan project is on track for start-up by the end of 2019, which will be transformational for Noble Energy.  Financially, we paid down $609 million in debt and accelerated the return of capital to shareholders, including $295 million in share repurchases and $208 million in dividends. As a result, we believe we are well positioned for the future.
I, along with our Board of Directors and executive team, am committed to providing you information about the Company in a manner that is easy to access and understand. Our Proxy Statement summarizes our business and executive compensation program with charts and graphics we believe aid in assessing our programs and progress. Also, we have continued to eliminate redundancy within the Proxy Statement to make it more reader-friendly.
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis that begins on page 29 describes our executive compensation program and shows the direct link between performance and executive compensation. Beginning on page 13, we provide the qualifications of our directors and why they are the right people to represent you.
Your vote is important to us and our business. I encourage you to sign and return your proxy card, or use telephone or Internet voting prior to the meeting to ensure your shares are represented and voted at the meeting. Instructions on how to vote begin on page 58.
I look forward to seeing you at the meeting. We appreciate your ongoing support as a shareholder of Noble Energy.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2018 Business Highlights 
During 2018, we continued to enhance our portfolio, achieved a number of strategic objectives, focused on operational execution and capital efficiency and delivered on shareholder return initiatives. In 2018, we accomplished the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Portfolio enhancements, including: 
• generated $2B in proceeds through sale of 7.5% working interest in Tamar, sale of our 50% interest in CONE Gathering LLC, sale of our 34.1% limited partner interest in CNX Midstream Partners LP, Gulf of Mexico exit and non-core onshore U.S. divestments; 
• acquired > 100,000 acres in unconventional new U.S. onshore opportunities and reached agreement on a 40% operated interest in 2 million acres in a new country offshore play;  
• acquisition of the Saddle Butte system by our midstream segment; and 
• executed acreage swap to solidify Mustang and Wells Ranch position in the DJ Basin. 
• Operational accomplishments, including: 
• demonstrated peer leading safety and environmental performance with low days away from work and recordable incident rate; 
• focused capital and resources on our highest margin assets within U.S. onshore liquids plays and Leviathan development; 
• negotiated a heads-of-agreement for Alen gas monetization in Equatorial Guinea, first step in future monetization of up to 3 TCF gross discovered in the area;  
• achieved record U.S. oil liquids volumes led by Delaware and DJ Basin growth 15% year-over-year growth;  
• delivered year-over-year volume increase of approximately 11% (adjusted for divestitures); 
• progressed natural gas marketing activities to fill Leviathan Phase 1 capacity, including executed agreements to support delivery of natural gas into Egypt; 
• progressed the Leviathan project to 75% complete; 
• secured near-term flow assurance and long-term out-of-basin takeaway capacity from the Delaware Basin to the Gulf Coast, with access to export markets;  
• executed Mustang row development in the DJ Basin and received approval for the first Colorado Comprehensive Drilling Plan of its size for the Mustang area (100 square miles); and 
• increased proved reserves by 5% from 2017 (excluding the impact of the Gulf of Mexico and Tamar sales). 
• Shareholder return initiatives, including: 
• executed share repurchase of approximately 10 million shares of Noble Energy stock for $295MM during the year; and 
• increased dividend to 11 cents per share per quarter for Noble Energy common shares for second, third and fourth quarters. 
• Financial initiatives, including: 
• achieved $2.3B net cash provided from operating activities (consolidated) and $1.1B of free cash flow(1) (excluding impact of NBLX) through portfolio optimization and reduced expenses; 
• strengthened Company's balance sheet by paying down $609MM of NBL debt;  
• enhanced strong liquidity position by increasing cash on hand and maintaining unused borrowing capacity; and 
• credit rating outlook upgraded from 2 of 3 rating agencies. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee believes that the Company made substantial progress toward positioning the Company for continued and sustainable long-term success, through our strengthened financial position, strong operational performance, advancements on critical strategic outcomes and shareholder value creation.  Our 2018 shareholder return did not reflect these accomplishments to the degree we anticipated; we ended the year with a total shareholder return ("TSR") of negative 35% and 9th out of 14 in our 2018 peer group (as measured from January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2018).

Leadership Transition
Our CEO, the Board of Directors and the management team also successfully led the Company through the transition of key executive leadership positions in 2018. Noble Energy attracted top talent such as Brent Smolik, President & COO, and Rachel Clingman, Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary.   In addition, we have added two new directors to the Board in the last 18 months, Holli C. Ladhani and Barbara J. Duganier, both with extensive financial expertise and leadership experience.
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
Increased Focus on Pay for Performance
Our executive compensation program is described in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis and is designed to align executive pay with performance and to create long-term shareholder value through significant "at-risk" compensation.  In 2018, we continued to emphasize performance-based compensation, with 64% of our CEO's target compensation being performance-based as shown in the following chart.
To further connect executive pay to Company performance, the performance awards component of our long-term incentive program was increased from 33% to 50% of the total long-term award.  In addition, the vesting period of the restricted stock component of the long-term incentive award was increased from two to three years to further align the vesting period with longer-term Company performance. 
Components of Compensation - CEO Mix
 Stock Options  Restricted Stock  Performance Share Award v
Short-term Incentive Plan
As previously disclosed, for the 2018 Plan year, the Compensation Committee increased our focus on financial performance metrics by adding in our Short-Term Incentive Plan ("STIP") cash flow per debt adjusted share growth and two new returns-based metrics, return on average capital employed ("ROACE") and cash return on capital invested ("CROCI"). These metrics reinforce our objective of aligning our compensation program with our capital strategy and focus on long term shareholder value creation. 
Company performance for the 2018 Plan year focused on continued progress on our strategic outcomes against a backdrop of commodity price and cost volatility and market uncertainty.   We strengthened our financial position with free cash flow significantly ahead of target and material debt reduction.  We also continued to demonstrate top tier safety performance and advanced our portfolio development to deliver sustained value.  In determining the 2018 STIP award, the Compensation Committee considered the accomplishment of having a majority of Coloradans support oil and gas instead of a setback initiative, establishment of the Mustang Comprehensive Development Plan, and delivery on critical strategic outcomes such as the Gulf of Mexico exit and progress on the Leviathan project.  However, the shortfalls in reaching our cost and volume targets, as well as absolute and relative share price performance, were significant contributors to the discretionary component of the plan.  Although the quantitative results were slightly above target, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion and approved a Short-Term Incentive Plan payout of 85% of target.   
Target versus Realizable Compensation 
The chart below reflects again the alignment we seek to achieve between executive compensation and Company performance in our total compensation program. Our executives do not achieve target value unless:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the stock price appreciates on an absolute basis;  
• the Company meets or exceeds median peer stock performance; and  
• the Company meets or exceeds important financial and operational goals.   
[END TABLE]
As depicted in the chart below and based on the Company's stock price at December 31, 2018, the realizable value of Mr. Stover's total compensation has averaged 48% across the past three years. 
We believe our compensation program is operating as designed as our below target shareholder return results in below target compensation for our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"), demonstrating that our compensation program appropriately aligns pay with performance.

2019 Key Executive Compensation Actions
Performance and Compensation Benchmarking Peer Group Refinements
To enhance our benchmarking of competitive performance and executive compensation, the Compensation Committee identified two peer groups: one for compensation benchmarking purposes and one for performance evaluation purposes.  
Compensation Benchmarking
The Committee determined that one singular peer group does not meet the needs of our compensation benchmarking and performance evaluation processes.  The Committee and management believe utilizing a peer group comprised of companies of similar size and scope reduces volatility in the benchmarking process.  This new peer group is balanced with companies both larger and smaller than Noble in an attempt to have a benchmarking process less likely to be distorted by significantly smaller and larger companies with different pay practices.  
Performance Benchmarking
To evaluate relative Company performance, the Committee feels it is important to assess Noble's performance against companies with similar long-term strategies.  Basin operations, international exposure and commodity mix were considered in defining this performance peer group.  We believe our performance will be appropriately benchmarked against companies with similar commodity exposure, basin specific influences and with whom we compete for investor capital. 
2019 Short-Term Incentive Plan Enhancements
Each year the Compensation Committee assesses the performance metrics driving incentive compensation.  The Compensation Committee considers the strategic direction of the organization, the alignment of metrics with shareholder value creation, and feedback received during our spring and fall shareholder engagement processes. With respect to the STIP metrics, we will replace the U.S. onshore drill & complete rate of return metric with a quantitative capital efficiency metric. The new capital efficiency metric will evaluate the organization's ability to deliver returns by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• optimizing our capital allocation; 
• executing planned projects timely and efficiently; and 
• controlling spend to maintain discipline. 
[END TABLE]
We will also add a new qualitative metric to the STIP assessing Noble's relative performance in each of our operating areas. While the capital efficiency metric focuses on our ability to create value through capital allocation, the Compensation Committee also believes it is important to measure our relative performance in the basins in which we operate.  We strive to differentiate ourselves as industry leading performers in each of our key basins through safe and efficient operations, capital efficiency and returns. 
Important Date for 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
Shareholder proposals and nominees for director(s) to be submitted for inclusion in our 2020 Proxy Statement pursuant to our By-Laws or Rule 14a-8 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), must be received by us no later than October 31, 2019.

Our Board regularly reviews developments in corporate governance and updates our corporate governance documents and practices as appropriate.  Amendments to these documents will be promptly posted on our Website.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Leadership Structure  
[END TABLE]
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Our Board has historically combined the role of chairman of the board with the role of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), maintaining a separate empowered lead independent director position to strengthen our governance structure. Our Board believes this provides an efficient and effective leadership model. Combining the two roles fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making and alignment on corporate strategy. We have not experienced any governance or management issues resulting from combining the two roles and, in this combined role, Mr. Stover has provided strategic, operational and technical expertise, vision and a proven ability to lead our Company.  
Annual Review of Board Leadership Structure
Our Board recognizes that no single leadership structure is right for all companies at all times and that, depending on the circumstances, other leadership models, such as a separate independent chairman of the board, might be appropriate. 
Our Board will review, at least annually, the continued appropriateness of the combined chairman/CEO structure, as opposed to a split role or other structure.  All such reviews will occur outside the presence of the Chairman and CEO, at a meeting of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and/or at an executive session of the Board. 
Lead Independent Director
Our lead independent director is elected annually by our Board and has authority described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving the scheduling of regular and, where feasible, special meetings of the Board to ensure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; 
• consulting with the Chairman to establish, and approve, the agenda and scope of materials for each Board meeting; 
• presiding at all executive sessions of the independent directors and Board meetings at which the Chairman is not present; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serving as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors and coordinating the activities of such directors; 
• coordinating the agenda for, and moderating sessions of the Board's independent directors; and 
• facilitating communications among the other members of the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Michael Cawley has served as the lead independent director since 2001.  In January 2019, our Nominating and Governance Committee nominated, and our Board approved the appointment of, Mr. Scott Urban to serve as the lead independent director of the Board effective as of the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  In addition, our Board approved an amendment to our By-Laws to allow the lead independent director to remain eligible for election to the Board one additional year beyond his 72nd birthday, to provide for an orderly transition of duties to the newly appointed lead independent director.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board and Committees 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, our Board held 12 meetings and its committees held 19 meetings. Each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which the director served during 2018.
Our Board has the following four standing committees, each with a written charter adopted by the Board and available on our website:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee; 
• Corporate Governance and Nominating  ("Governance") Committee; 
• Compensation, Benefits and Stock Option ("Compensation") Committee; and 
• Safety, Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility ("SSCR") Committee. 
[END TABLE]
In July 2018, our former Environment, Health and Safety Committee was reorganized into the SSCR Committee, to further align its primary responsibilities with the executive level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee and refine the focus of the committee as identified below.

(1) Each member of our Audit Committee has been determined by the Board to be financially literate and meets the additional criteria for independence of audit committee members as set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rule 10A-3(b)(1). Mr. Van Kleef has been determined by the Board to be an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
(2) Mr. Craddock was the CEO of Rosetta Resources Inc. ("Rosetta") prior to its merger with the Company on July 20, 2015.  Our Board has reviewed the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the standards and guidance of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and concluded that Mr. Craddock is independent. As a prior employee of the acquired company, Rosetta, an entity previously unaffiliated with the Company, the NYSE allows a determination of independence since the termination of his employment with Rosetta occurred concurrently with the closing of the merger.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal year 2018, Messrs. Berenson, Craddock, Edelman, Urban and Ms. Williamson served as members of the Compensation Committee, with Ms. Williamson exiting the committee on April 24, 2018.  None of the Compensation Committee members was an officer or employee of the Company or former officer of the Company or had any business relationship or conducted any business with the Company other than as described in the Related Person Transactions disclosure in this Proxy Statement. During fiscal year 2018, none of our executive officers served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee (or other committee of the board performing equivalent functions) of another entity where an executive officer of such entity served as a director of the Company or on our Compensation Committee.

Board Development and Succession Planning 
[END TABLE]
Our Board plays a key role in the oversight of the Company's business.  We are committed to ensuring that it represents a diversity of qualifications, attributes, skills and experience necessary for our future. We recognize that our shareholders are interested in board tenure and diversity —  areas of consideration in our Board succession planning. We know that the most successful boards, like their executive management team counterparts, have the collective chemistry, strength, agility and strategic perspective to meet the challenges  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
of the fast-moving global business environment within which we operate. In our view, our current Board possesses these traits, and we have taken a number of steps to position it for our future.
First, we have continued to expand our outreach as part of our shareholder engagement program. In 2018, we requested meetings with 38 shareholders, representing approximately 78% of our outstanding stock. We also solicited feedback from representatives of the proxy advisory firms, Glass, Lewis & Co. ("Glass Lewis") and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS"). These meetings were invaluable in providing validation of our practices in some areas, while identifying areas for improvement in others.  In general, we received positive feedback on our continued efforts to enhance our public disclosures and our progress on Board refreshment.  We also received suggestions on improving our efforts and disclosures on Board skills and diversity identification, Board strategy, succession planning and climate reporting.
Second, we continue to focus on the importance of Board refreshment adding Ms. Duganier to the Board in May of 2018, bringing financial expertise along with extensive leadership and cyber security experience.  In addition, the Board underwent an evaluation process to identify the skills needed to enhance the strategic direction of the Board.  The Company has engaged an independent director search firm to help identify prospective director candidates. The Governance Committee continues discussions to evaluate the skill-sets needed to maximize Board effectiveness and support the strategic direction of the Company.
Third, we have evolved our Board self-evaluation process to a more participative discussion conducted by an independent third-party law firm. In the current environment, this discussion has included Board refreshment, Company strategic plan and alignment with management.
Fourth, in early 2017, we amended our By-Laws to reduce the age at which a director would not stand for election from 75 to 72.  We believe that this will facilitate a more orderly succession process that provides for the periodic infusion of new directors and the diversity of their perspectives. In February 2019, we further amended our By-Laws to allow for the lead  independent director to remain eligible for election for one additional year, but not serve as the lead, to provide for an orderly transition of duties to the newly appointed lead independent.  As of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Mr. Cox will have reached the mandatory retirement age of 72; as a result, after 35 years of experience with our Board, he will not stand for re-election.
Finally, we have revisited our director compensation program to ensure its alignment with our compensation peer group, increasing our annual board member retainer and the SSCR chair retainer.   We believe that this change is consistent with overall peer company practices.

Senior Leadership Succession Planning
A key responsibility of our CEO and Board in the area of risk management is ensuring that an effective process is in place to provide continuity of leadership over the long-term. Each year, a review of senior leadership succession is conducted by our Board. During this review, the CEO and the independent directors discuss candidates for senior leadership positions, succession timing for those positions and development plans for the highest-potential candidates. This process forms the basis for ongoing leadership assignments.  
During 2018, our CEO, the Board of Directors and the management team successfully led the Company through the transition of key executive leadership positions. Noble Energy attracted top talent such as Brent Smolik, President & Chief Operating Officer, and Rachel Clingman, Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary.

We received feedback regarding board skills and diversity, executive compensation metrics and climate reporting disclosures.  Specifically, the Company has committed to publish a climate report in 2019 after extensive engagement with our shareholders.  The Company has also expanded its disclosures surrounding our Board skills, experiences and diverse attributes.  Feedback

Director Independence and Related Person Transactions 
[END TABLE]
Director Independence 
Our Governance Committee annually reviews the independence of our non-management directors and reports its findings to our Board. To assist in this review, our Board has adopted standards for director independence consistent with those of the NYSE and SEC. These independence standards are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on our Website under the heading "Corporate Governance."
In making independence determinations, our Board considers relevant facts and circumstances, including transactions, relationships and arrangements between each director or any member of the director's immediate family and the Company, our subsidiaries and affiliates. Transactions considered by the Board during 2018 through January 31, 2019 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company royalty program payments to Mr. Cox of $277,981 and Mr. Cawley of $8,648; 
• payments of $2,328,513 to Flogistix LP ("Flogistix"), a portfolio company of White Deer Energy ("White Deer"), of which Mr. Edelman is a managing partner; 
• payments in the form of charitable contributions totaling $2,061,805 to the Wildlife Conservation Society, of which Mr. Edelman is a member of the board of trustees;  
• payments of approximate $30,595,754 to MRC Global (US) Inc., of which Ms. Duganier is a director;  
• payments of approximately $20,874,448 to Oil States International, Inc., of which Mr. Van Kleef is a director;  
• payments of approximately $927,499 to Pioneer Energy Services Corp. and affiliates, of which Mr. Urban is a director; and 
• payments of $31,111,098 to Select Energy Services, Inc. ("Select Energy") and affiliated companies of which Ms. Ladhani is the President and Chief Executive Officer. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
Under the NYSE Listing Standards, a director will not be considered independent if he/she is employed by a company that has, within the last three years, made or received payments from the Company, in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such Company's revenues. Ms. Ladhani was elected as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Select Energy on November 1, 2017, pursuant to the merger of Select Energy with Rockwater Energy Solutions, Inc. ("Rockwater"). During 2018, the Company made payments to Select Energy of approximately $28.2 million, which is less than 2% of Select Energy's 2018 gross revenues.  Effective October 26, 2017, the Board elected Ms. Ladhani as a director and has determined that she is not currently independent under the NYSE Listing Standards.  Ms. Ladhani is a valuable member of the Board and adds over 18 years of experience in the broader energy industry, including CEO and CFO leadership, as well as financial expertise to our Board.  The Company expects that its payments to Select Energy will be less than 2% of Select Energy's revenues prospectively. The Board anticipates being able to reconsider her independence in 2021.
Under NYSE Listing Standards, a director is not independent if he/she has been within the last three years an employee of the listed company.  However, NYSE guidance clarifies that a former employee of an acquired company may still be considered independent if the employment relationship ended concurrent with a merger.  Mr. Craddock's employment with Rosetta ended concurrently with the Company's merger with Rosetta on July 20, 2015.  Mr. Craddock did not receive additional consideration subsequent to the merger, none of the Rosetta executives were retained by the Company and the acquired assets represent a small portion of the Company's total asset portfolio.  Therefore, after review of relevant NYSE guidance, as well as other relevant facts and circumstances, the Company found, and continues to find, Mr. Craddock to be an independent director.  Mr. Craddock brings valuable knowledge of our Delaware and Eagle Ford Shale assets, as well as CEO experience and a high level of financial literacy to our Board.
After reviewing these transactions, relationships and arrangements, on February 8, 2019 our Board determined that no material relationship existed that would interfere with the ability of Messrs. Berenson, Cawley, Cox, Craddock, Edelman, Urban, Van Kleef or Ms. Duganier to exercise independent judgment and that each is independent for Board membership purposes. Our Board has also determined that all members of our Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees are independent under the applicable NYSE independence standards and SEC rules. 
Related Person Transactions
We review all relationships and transactions in which the Company and its directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. We have developed and implemented processes and controls to obtain information from our directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether the Company or a related  person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction.
As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to our Company or a related person are disclosed in our annual Proxy Statement. In addition, our Governance Committee or Board (if appropriate) reviews and approves or ratifies any related person transaction that is required to be disclosed. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a disclosable related person transaction, consideration is given to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction; 
• the material terms of the transaction, including the amount and type of transaction; 
• the importance of the transaction to the related person; 
• the importance of the transaction to the Company; 
• whether the transaction would impair the judgment or ability of a director or executive officer to act in our best interest; and 
• any other matters deemed appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
Any director who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote respecting approval or ratification of the transaction, but that director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at the meeting where the transaction is considered.
Mr. Edelman is a managing partner of White Deer, a private equity firm that invests in the oil and gas industry. White Deer manages funds that own equity interests in certain companies with which the Company conducts business. During fiscal year 2018 and through January 31, 2019 the Company made payments totaling $2.3 million to Flogistix for the leasing of gas compression units.  White Deer manages funds that own an approximately 90% interest in Flogistix.  Mr. Edelman has an estimated indirect pecuniary interest of less than 5% in Flogistix.
Ms. Ladhani is the President and CEO of Select Energy, a public company that provides its customers with efficient and environmentally conscious water and chemical solutions to service the full life cycle of the well.  During fiscal year 2018 and through January 31, 2019, the Company made payments totaling $31.1 million to Select Energy companies. In addition, White Deer owns a less than 5% interest in Select Energy, and Mr. Edelman has an indirect pecuniary interest of less than 1% in Select Energy, through this investment by White Deer.
Based upon the review and recommendations of our Governance Committee and our Board, we believe these transactions were in our best interest and on terms no less favorable to us than we could have achieved with an unaffiliated party. 
During fiscal year 2018 and through January 31, 2019, there were no other transactions in excess of $120,000 between our Company and a related person in which the related person had a direct or indirect material interest.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock. Directors, executive officers and more than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to provide us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of the reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors, officers and more than 10% beneficial owners were complied with during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Election of Directors (Proposal 1)
Our Board recommends voting for the nine director nominees as presented below, seven of whom are independent.  The business experience of each nominee, as well as the qualifications that led our Board to select them for election to the Board, is discussed below. All directors are elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Election Process 
[END TABLE]
Our By-Laws provide that the number of directors shall be determined by the Board and that in an election where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each director must receive the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director.
Our Board will nominate candidates for election or re-election who agree to tender, promptly following the annual meeting, irrevocable resignations that will be effective upon (a) the failure to receive the required vote at the next annual meeting and (b) acceptance by the Board. In addition, our Board will fill director vacancies and new directorships only with candidates who agree to tender the same form of resignation promptly following their appointment to the Board.
If an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election, then, within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote, our Governance Committee will act to determine whether to accept the director's resignation and will submit its recommendation for consideration by our Board. The Board will promptly act on the resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the Governance Committee, and publicly disclose its decision and rationale.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Nominations 
[END TABLE]
Our Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for director and for recommending to our Board a slate of nominees for election at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Nominees may be suggested by directors, members of management, shareholders or, in some cases, by a third-party search firm.
Shareholders who wish the Governance Committee to consider their recommendations for nominees for the position of director should submit a recommendation in writing to the Governance Committee, in care of the Company Secretary, between 120 and 150 days before the anniversary date of the mailing of the previous year's proxy materials. Shareholder nominees for directors to be submitted for inclusion in our 2020 Proxy Statement must be received by us by October 31, 2019. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines specify the processes for evaluating nominees for director and the requirements for a shareholder recommendation for a director nominee.
In addition, our By-Laws permit certain qualifying shareholders to include director nominees in our Proxy Statement. This proxy access mechanism allows a shareholder or group of up to 25 shareholders owning at least 3% of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to submit their own candidate for election to our Board. These nominees may not constitute more than 25% of our Board at any time. Proxy access nominations must be delivered to the Company between 120 and 150 days before the anniversary date of the mailing of the previous year's proxy materials and satisfy certain other criteria specified in our By-Laws.  For inclusion in our 2019 Proxy Statement, proxy access nominations must be received by us no later than October 31, 2019.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Qualifications 
[END TABLE]
Our Governance Committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a director are that a nominee demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to our Board's oversight of our business and affairs and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. Nominees for director shall be those people  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Election of Directors (Proposal 1) 
[END TABLE]
who, after taking into account their skills, expertise, integrity, character, judgment, independence, corporate experience, length of service, potential conflicts of interest and commitments (including, among other things, service on the boards or comparable governing bodies of other public or private companies, charities, civic bodies or similar organizations) and other diverse attributes and qualities, are believed to enhance our Board's ability to manage and direct, in an effective manner, our business and affairs, including, when applicable, to enhance the ability of the committees of our Board to fulfill their duties and to satisfy any independence requirements imposed by law, regulation or listing standards of the NYSE.
In general, nominees for director should have an understanding of the workings of large business organizations such as ours and senior level executive experience, as well as the ability to make independent, analytical judgments, the ability to communicate effectively and the ability and willingness to devote the time and effort to be an effective and contributing member of our Board. In addition, our Governance Committee will examine a candidate's specific experiences and skills, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest, and independence from management and our Company.  It will also seek to have our Board represent a diversity of background, experience and other diverse attributes.  Our Governance Committee annually reviews its long-term plan for Board composition, giving consideration to the foregoing factors. The above criteria and guidelines, together with the section of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines entitled "Director Qualification Standards," constitute the policy of the Governance Committee regarding the recommendation of new nominees or the re-election of directors to the Company's Board of Directors or its committees.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Nominees for Director 
[END TABLE]
Upon recommendation of the Governance Committee, our Board has nominated Jeffrey L. Berenson, Michael A. Cawley, James E. Craddock, Barbara J. Duganier, Thomas J. Edelman, Holli C. Ladhani, David L. Stover, Scott D. Urban and William T. Van Kleef for election as director. 
Each of the director nominees currently serves on our Board and was elected by the shareholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with the exception of Barbara J. Duganier, who was appointed on May 29, 2018 by our Board. If elected, each nominee will hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if any nominee should be unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve, proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a substitute by our Board, or our Board may reduce the number of directors.
Our Board believes that the combination of the various qualifications, skills, experiences and diverse attributes of the 2019 director nominees will contribute to an effective and well-functioning board. Our Board and the Governance Committee believe that, individually and as a whole, these director nominees possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the business and quality advice and counsel to our Company's management.

Equity 
[END TABLE]
The 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Noble Energy, Inc. ("2015 Plan") provides for grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock to our non-employee directors, and was approved by shareholders on April 28, 2015.
Stock options were issued with an exercise price equal to the fair market value, as defined in the 2015 Plan, of our common stock on the date of grant and may be exercised beginning one year after the date of grant. They expire 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock is restricted for a period of one year from the date of award.  The vesting of stock options and restricted stock under the 2015 Plan is not contingent upon the satisfaction of any performance criteria and will accelerate upon a termination of Board membership following a change of control, as defined in the 2015 Plan.
Newly elected non-employee directors receive, on the date of initial election to our Board, an award with a total value of $250,000 to be allocated 100% to restricted shares. On October 24, 2017 our Board approved the grant of full value shares for annual equity and new hire grants, to replace the prior practice of granting one-half stock options and one-half restricted shares.
On January 29, 2019 our Board considered the Company's 2018 results in an adverse business environment in making the 2018 awards based on the $200,000 target value, with 100% of the grant in restricted stock, resulting in 8,932 shares of restricted stock being awarded to each non-employee director, effective February 1, 2019.

Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor (Proposal 2) 
[END TABLE]
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor (Proposal 2)
The Audit Committee of our Board is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent external audit firm retained to audit our financial statements.  The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent external auditor for 2019.  KPMG has been retained as our external auditor continuously since May 2002.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with our retention of KPMG.  In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm.
In conjunction with the mandated rotation of the audit firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of KPMG's new lead engagement partner.  The members of the Audit Committee and our Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as our independent external auditor is in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders.
Although action by our shareholders on this matter is not required, our Audit Committee believes that it is important to seek shareholder ratification of this appointment in light of the critical role played by our independent auditor in maintaining the integrity of our financial controls and reporting. One or more representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at our annual meeting and will be able to make a statement if they so desire and respond to appropriate questions.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Our Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent auditor.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee approves all audit and non-audit services to be provided by our Independent Auditor prior to the receipt of such services.  The Audit Committee Chair has the authority to pre-approve services of up to $50,000 rendered by our Independent Auditor.  Any pre-approval of services by the Audit Committee Chair shall be reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
The Audit Committee considers whether KPMG's rendering of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining its independence.  All audit-related services, tax services and other services for 2018 set forth in the table above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee Chair or the Audit Committee, as provided above, which in either case determined that such services would not impair the independence of our auditor and are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Proposal 3) 
[END TABLE]
Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Proposal 3) 
As we do each year, and as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation disclosure rules.
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain high quality individuals and to link their compensation to performance.  We describe this program, including how it links executive compensation to Company performance, in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement.  We believe that our program continues to be appropriately designed to link compensation to performance.
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation disclosure rules. The vote is advisory, which means that it is not binding on our Company, Board or Compensation Committee. To the extent there is any significant vote against our Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, our Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any action is necessary to address the concerns of shareholders.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at our annual meeting:
RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures.

Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 LTIP (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan to Authorize Additional Shares  (Proposal 4)
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, our shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan that will increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan from 29,000,000 shares to 44,000,000 shares (an increase of 15,000,000 shares) and remove certain provisions no longer applicable due to changes in the federal tax laws. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code, and so the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan removes provisions designed to allow the Company to provide "performance-based compensation" under the obsolete tax rules. No awards were granted under the 2017 Plan that were intended to be exempt from IRC Section 162(m) as performance-based compensation. Our Board approved this amendment on January 29, 2019, subject to shareholder approval at our annual meeting.
Background and Purpose
Our Board recommends approval of the amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan. The proposed increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan would enable the continued use of the 2017 Plan for stock-based grants and awards consistent with the objectives of our compensation program.
The use of stock-based grants and awards under the 2017 Plan continues to be an important part of our compensation program. Of the 29,000,000 shares currently authorized for issuance under the plan, 12,456,066 shares remain available for future grant or award as of February 22, 2019. We do not believe that this leaves sufficient shares available for more than one additional year of grants and awards. By increasing the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan by 15,000,000 a total of 27,456,066 shares would be available under the 2017 Plan. In addition, as of February 22, 2019, 317,591 shares remain available for future grant or award under the Noble Energy, Inc. 2015 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "2015 Plan") (together, the 2015 Plan with the 2017 Plan would provide for 27,773,657 shares available). This increase would give us the flexibility to continue to responsibly address our future equity compensation needs.
As of the record date of February 22, 2019, there were a total of 483,584,388 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. We had a total of 13,393,029 stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $44.52 and a weighted average remaining term of 4.44 years, 4,750,089 shares of restricted stock outstanding, and 2,228,992 performance share awards outstanding as of the record date. On that date the reported closing price per share of our common stock on the NYSE was $23.16.
If the proposed amendment and restatement is not approved by our shareholders, the 2017 Plan will remain in effect in its present form.
Summary
The following description of the 2017 Plan is a summary, does not purport to be a complete description of the 2017 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2017 Plan. A copy of the 2017 Plan (as amended and restated) is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix C and is incorporated herein by reference.
Purposes. The 2017 Plan allows for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, stock awards and other incentive awards to employees and other service providers of the Company and its affiliates who are in a position to make a positive contribution to the success of the Company and its affiliates. The purposes of the 2017 Plan are to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to perform services for the Company and its affiliates, to further align the interests of those individuals with those of our shareholders and to more closely link compensation with Company performance. The 2017 Plan provides an essential component of the Company's total compensation package, reflecting the importance that we place on aligning the interests of our service providers with those of our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 LTIP (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
Administration. The 2017 Plan provides for administration by the Committee, which may be the Compensation Committee or such other committee as our Board may designate. The Committee has the authority to make all determinations under, prescribe all forms for use with, and adopt rules for the administration of, the 2017 Plan. The Committee has the right to delegate to one or more officers of the Company any right granted to the Committee under the 2017 Plan, except where such delegation would violate state corporate law.
Eligibility. Employees and other service providers of the Company and our affiliates who, in the opinion of the Committee, are in a position to make a positive contribution to the success of the Company and our affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2017 Plan. The Committee determines the type and size of award and sets the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the award within the confines of the 2017 Plan's terms. All of our executive officers and approximately 898 other current employees participate in the 2017 Plan. 
Available Shares. The maximum number of shares of common stock remaining available for grant under the 2017 Plan is 12,456,066. For purposes of this share limit, (i) the grant of stock options reduces the share limit one share for each share subject to such an award, (ii) the grant of stock appreciation rights that may be paid or settled only in common stock, or in either cash or common stock (or a combination thereof), reduces the share limit one share for each share subject to such an award, (iii) the grant of restricted stock or stock awards reduces the share limit 2.39 shares for each share subject to such an award, and (iv) the grant of restricted stock units, performance awards or other incentive awards that may be paid or settled only in common stock, or in either cash or common stock, reduces the share limit 2.39 shares for each share subject to such an award. The grant of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance awards or other incentive awards that may be paid or settled only for cash does not affect the share limit. If any award other than an award that may be paid or settled only for cash is canceled or forfeited, or terminates, expires or lapses, for any reason, the shares then subject to such award will again be available for grant of awards under the 2017 Plan and will be added back to the number of shares available for grant on the same numerical basis as was used upon grant to reduce the number of shares available for grant of awards. Shares (i) tendered (either actually or by attestation) or withheld to satisfy an exercise price or tax withholding obligation for an award, or (ii) repurchased by the Company using stock option proceeds will not again be available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.  The 2017 Plan contains anti-dilution provisions that provide that, in the event of an equity restructuring or certain other corporate transactions, adjustments will be made in the maximum number of shares subject to the 2017 Plan, the award limits described below and the exercise price per share of outstanding awards.
Award Limits. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options under the 2017 Plan is 14,000,000 shares. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2017 Plan to any one person during a fiscal year is 800,000 shares. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2017 Plan to any one person during a fiscal year is 800,000 shares. 
No Repricing or Reload Rights. Except adjustment for certain corporate changes in accordance with the provisions of the 2017 Plan, no award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation or otherwise modified without stockholder approval, if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares underlying such award. Further, no stock option or stock appreciation right that is underwater may be canceled in exchange for a cash payment or for the purpose of granting a replacement award of a different type.

Types of Awards
Stock Options. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code and nonqualified stock options that are not intended to meet those requirements. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of the Company and its affiliates. All stock options will be subject to terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations established by the Committee, including rules as to exercisability in the event of termination of employment or service, as long as they are consistent with the terms of the 2017 Plan.
Generally, the exercise price of a stock option granted under the 2017 Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. However, the exercise price may be less if the stock option is granted in connection with a transaction and complies with certain requirements of the Code. Incentive stock options must be granted at 100% of fair market value (or, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder, 110% of fair market value). The exercise price of a stock option may be paid in cash (or equivalents), in shares of Company common stock that the participant already owns, or such other consideration as the Compensation Committee approves.
Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"). A stock appreciation right entitles the participant to receive an amount in cash and/or shares of common stock, as determined by the Committee, equal to the amount by which our common stock appreciates in value after the date of the award. The Committee will determine when the SAR will vest and become exercisable. Generally, the exercise price of a SAR will not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. However, the exercise price may be less if the stock is granted in connection with a transaction and complies with special rules under Section 409A of the Code. No SAR will be exercisable later than 10 years after the date of the grant. The Committee will set other terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations on SARs, including rules as to exercisability in the event of termination of employment or service.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). Restricted stock is common stock that must be returned to us if certain conditions are not satisfied. The Committee will determine the restriction period and may impose other terms, conditions and restrictions on restricted stock, including vesting upon achievement of performance goals pursuant to a performance award and rules as to vesting in the event of termination of employment or service. The Committee also may require the participant to pay for restricted stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement related to restricted stock, a participant holding restricted stock will have the right to receive dividends on the shares of restricted stock during the restriction period, vote the restricted stock and enjoy all other stockholder rights related to the shares of common stock. Restricted stock (and any associated dividends) generally will be held by the Company in escrow for the participant's benefit until such time as the restricted stock is either forfeited by the participant or the restrictions thereon terminate. Upon expiration of the restriction period, the participant is entitled to receive shares of common stock not subject to restriction.
Restricted stock units are fictional shares of common stock. The Committee will determine the restriction period and may impose other terms, conditions and restrictions on RSUs, including vesting upon achievement of performance goals pursuant to a performance award and rules as to vesting in the event of termination of employment or service. Upon the lapse of restrictions, the participant is entitled to receive one share of common stock or an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of one share of common stock as provided in the award agreement. An award of RSUs may include the grant of a tandem dividend equivalent cash right or dividend equivalent unit right. A dividend equivalent cash right is a contingent right to receive an amount in cash equal to the cash distributions made with respect to a share of common stock during the period the RSU is outstanding. A dividend equivalent unit right is a contingent right to have additional RSUs credited to the participant equal to the number of shares of common stock (at fair market value) that may be purchased with the cash dividends. No dividend equivalent cash right or dividend equivalent unit right will vest or be payable sooner than the date on which the underlying RSU has vested.
Performance Awards. A performance award is an award payable in cash (including an annual bonus award) or common stock (or a combination thereof) upon the achievement of certain performance goals over a performance period. Performance awards may be combined with other awards to impose performance criteria as part of the terms of the other awards. For each performance award, the Committee will determine (i) the amount a participant may earn in the form of cash or shares of common stock or a formula for determining the amount payable to the  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 LTIP (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
participant, (ii) the performance criteria and level of achievement versus such performance criteria that will determine the amount payable or number of shares of common stock to be granted, issued, retained and/or vested, (iii) the performance period over which performance is to be measured, which may not be shorter than one year, (iv) the timing of any payments to be made, (v) restrictions on the transferability of the award and (vi) other terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with the 2017 Plan.
The performance measure(s) determined by the Committee for a performance award may be described in terms of objectives that are related to the individual participant or objectives that are company-wide or related to a subsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit of the Company or an affiliate in which the participant is employed or with respect to which the participant performs services, and may consist of one or more of any combination of the following criteria as set forth by the Committee in the performance award: 1) an amount or level of earnings or cash flow; 2) earnings or cash flow per share (whether on a pre-tax, after-tax, operational or other basis); 3) return on equity or assets; 4) return on capital or invested capital and other related financial measures; 5) cash flow or EBITDA; 6) revenues; 7) income, net income or operating income; 8) expenses or costs or expense levels or cost levels (absolute or per unit); 9) proceeds of sale or other dispositions; 10) share price; 11) total stockholder return; 12) operating profit; 13) profit margin; 14) capital expenditures; 15) net borrowing, debt leverage levels, credit quality or debt ratings; 16) the accomplishment of mergers, acquisitions, disposition, or similar business transactions; 17) net asset value per share; 18) economic value added; 19) individual business objectives; 20) growth in reserves or production; 21) finding and development costs; and 22) safety results.
The Committee has the authority to reduce, but not to increase, the amount payable in cash and the number of shares of common stock to be issued, retained or vested pursuant to such a performance award.
Stock Awards. Stock awards are shares of common stock awarded to participants that are subject to no restrictions. Stock awards may be issued for cash consideration or for no cash consideration.
Other Incentive Awards. The Committee may grant other incentive awards under the 2017 Plan based upon, payable in or otherwise related to, shares of common stock if the Committee determines that the other incentive awards are consistent with the purposes of the 2017 Plan. Other incentive awards will be subject to any terms, conditions, restrictions or limitations established by the Committee. Payment of other incentive awards will be made at the times and in the forms, which may be cash, shares of common stock or other property, established by the Committee.
Change of Control. In the event of a change of control while a participant is employed by our Company or an affiliate followed by the termination of employment or service without cause or for good reason within the 24-month period following the change of control, each award outstanding under the 2017 Plan to such participant will become immediately vested and fully exercisable upon such termination and any restrictions applicable to the award will lapse on that date, provided that any performance award with performance-based vesting will vest upon such termination according to the performance achieved as measured through the last day of the month immediately preceding the date of such termination of employment or service. Upon a change of control where the Company is not the surviving entity (or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding stock options and SARs that are not exercised at or before the occurrence of the change of the control will be assumed by or replaced with comparable options and rights in the surviving entity (or a parent of the surviving entity) in accordance with Code requirements, and other outstanding awards will be converted into similar awards of the surviving entity (or a parent of the surviving entity). The Committee also has discretion, no later than the commencement of the change of control, to require any participant holding an award to surrender such award in exchange for appropriate consideration as described in the 2017 Plan.
Withholding Taxes. All applicable withholding taxes will be deducted from any payment made under the 2017 Plan, withheld from other compensation payable to the participant, or be required to be paid by the participant (or be subject to a participant's election to pay) prior to the making of any payment of cash or common stock under the 2017 Plan. Payment of withholding taxes may be made by withholding shares of common stock from any payment of common stock due or by the delivery by the participant to the Company or the applicable affiliate of previously acquired shares of common stock, in either case having an aggregate fair market value equal to the amount of the required withholding taxes. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Transferability. Generally, no award may be sold, transferred, pledged, exchanged, or disposed of, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. However, if provided in the award agreement, nonqualified stock options may be transferred by a participant to a permitted transferee.
Clawback Provision. By accepting or exercising any award granted under the 2017 Plan, each participant agrees to abide and be bound by any policies adopted by the Company, including our compensation recoupment policy as contained in our Code of Conduct, as amended from time to time, and any other policies adopted to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or exchange listing standards promulgated thereunder, providing for the repayment and/or forfeiture of any award or payment resulting from an accounting restatement or similar circumstances.
Amendment and Termination. Our Board may at any time suspend, terminate, amend or modify the 2017 Plan, but may not without stockholder approval make any modification or amendment that operates (i) to increase the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2017 Plan (other than adjustments in connection with certain corporate reorganizations and other events) or to change the designation or class of persons eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Plan, or (ii) to effect any change for which stockholder approval is required by or necessary to comply with applicable law or the listing requirements of an exchange or association on which the common stock is then listed or quoted. Upon termination of the 2017 Plan, the terms and provisions thereof will continue to apply to awards granted before termination. No suspension, termination, amendment or modification of the 2017 Plan will adversely affect in any material way any award previously granted under the 2017 Plan, without the consent of the participant.
Effectiveness. The amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan will become effective upon approval by the shareholders at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting. If so approved, unless terminated earlier, the amended and restated 2017 Plan will terminate on January 28, 2029.
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following summary is based on an analysis of the Code as currently in effect, existing laws, judicial decisions, administrative rulings, regulations and proposed regulations, all of which are subject to change. Moreover, the following is only a summary of United States federal income tax consequences. Actual tax consequences to participants may be either more or less favorable than those described below depending on the participants' particular circumstances. State and local tax consequences may in some cases differ from the federal tax consequences. The following summary of the income tax consequences in respect of the 2017 Plan is for general information only. Interested parties should consult their own advisors as to specific tax consequences of their awards, including the applicability and effect of state, local and foreign laws.
Incentive Stock Options. No income will be recognized by a participant for federal income tax purposes upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. The basis of shares transferred to a participant upon exercise of an incentive stock option is the price paid for the shares. If the participant holds the shares for at least one year after the transfer of the shares to the participant and two years after the grant of the stock option, the participant will recognize capital gain or loss upon sale of the shares received upon exercise equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the basis of the stock. In these circumstances, we will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes. Generally, if the shares are not held for that period, the participant will recognize ordinary income upon disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares, or if less (and if the disposition is a transaction in which loss, if any, will be recognized), the gain on disposition. Any additional gain realized by the participant upon the disposition will be a capital gain. If this occurs, we will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the ordinary income amount the participant recognizes. The excess of the fair market value of shares received upon the exercise of an incentive stock option over the option price for the shares is an item of adjustment for the participant for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Therefore, although no income is recognized upon exercise of an incentive stock option, a participant may be subject to alternative minimum tax as a result of the exercise.
Nonqualified Stock Options. No income is expected to be recognized by a participant for federal income tax purposes upon the grant of a nonqualified stock option. Upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 LTIP (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares. Income recognized upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option will be considered compensation subject to withholding at the time the income is recognized, and, therefore, the participant's employer must make the necessary arrangements with the participant to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment. Nonqualified stock options are designed to provide the employer with a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant at the time of the recognition by the participant, subject to the deduction limitations described below.
Stock Appreciation Rights. There is expected to be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of SARs. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of payment pursuant to SARs in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value of any common stock received. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Restricted Stock. If the restrictions on an award of shares of restricted stock are of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and are not freely transferable (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the participant will not recognize income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the award unless the participant affirmatively elects to include the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the award, less any amount paid for the shares, in gross income for the year of the award pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. In the absence of this election, the participant will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes on the date the shares either become freely transferable or are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code), the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on such date, less any amount paid for the shares. The employer will be entitled to a deduction at the time of income recognition to the participant in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below. If a Section 83(b) election is made within 30 days after the date the restricted stock is received, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock, and the employer will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time, less the amount paid, if any, by the participant for the restricted stock. If a Section 83(b) election is made, no additional income will be recognized by the participant upon the lapse of restrictions on the restricted stock, but, if the restricted stock is subsequently forfeited, the participant may not deduct the income that was recognized pursuant to the Section 83(b) election at the time of the receipt of the restricted stock.
Dividends on restricted stock accumulated during the restricted period that are paid to the participant at the end of the restricted period will be additional compensation taxable as ordinary income to the participant subject to withholding, unless the participant made an election under Section 83(b) of the Code. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the dividends includible in the participant's income as compensation. If the participant has made a Section 83(b) election, the dividends will be dividend income, rather than additional compensation, to the participant.
If the restrictions on an award of restricted stock are not of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not freely transferable, within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, the participant will recognize ordinary income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the transfer of the shares in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the transfer, less any amount paid therefor. The employer will be entitled to a deduction at that time in an amount equal to the amount the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares, subject to the deduction limitations described below.
Restricted Stock Units. There will be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of restricted stock units. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or transfer of shares of common stock in payment of the restricted stock units in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair market value of the common stock so transferred. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Dividend Equivalents. Generally, a participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or transfer of shares of common stock in payment of any dividend equivalent cash rights or dividend equivalent unit rights in an amount equal to the cash the participant receives or the fair market value  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Approval of Amendment and Restatement of the 2017 LTIP (Proposal 4) 
[END TABLE]
of the common stock so transferred, as applicable. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Performance Awards. There will be no federal income tax consequences to either the participant or the employer upon the grant of performance awards. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or shares of common stock in payment of performance awards in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair market value of the common stock so transferred. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participant's income.
Stock Awards. The participant will recognize income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the stock award and, subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.
Other Incentive Awards. The tax treatment of other incentive awards will depend on the type of award. In general, the participant will be subject to income tax withholding at the time when the ordinary income is recognized. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the participant's employer will be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and for the same amount.
Limitations on the Employer's Compensation Deduction. Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deduction certain publicly held employers may claim for otherwise deductible compensation payable to certain current and former executive officers of the employer to the extent the compensation paid to such an officer for the year exceeds $1 million. The 2017 Plan originally was designed to allow certain types of awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation" that would be deductible without regard to the limits of Section 162(m). However, the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  None of the awards granted under the 2017 Plan prior to the tax law change were exempt under the "performance-based compensation" exception.  Accordingly, all awards granted under the 2017 Plan are subject to the deduction limit under Section 162(m).
Excess Parachute Payments. Section 280G of the Code limits the deduction that the employer may take for otherwise deductible compensation payable to certain individuals if the compensation constitutes an "excess parachute payment." Excess parachute payments arise from payments made to disqualified individuals that are in the nature of compensation and are contingent on changes in ownership or control of the employer or certain affiliates. Accelerated vesting or payment of awards under the 2017 Plan upon a change in ownership or control of the employer or its affiliates could result in excess parachute payments. In addition to the deduction limitation, a disqualified individual receiving an excess parachute payment is subject to a 20% excise tax on the amount thereof.
Application of Section 409A of the Code. Section 409A of the Code imposes an additional 20% tax and interest on an individual receiving nonqualified deferred compensation under a plan that fails to satisfy certain requirements. For purposes of Section 409A, "nonqualified deferred compensation" includes equity-based incentive programs, including some stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit programs. The awards made pursuant to the 2017 Plan will be designed to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent the awards granted under the 2017 Plan are not exempt from coverage. However, if the 2017 Plan fails to comply with Section 409A in operation, a participant could be subject to the additional taxes and interest.

Our Compensation Philosophy 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executive pay with performance and long-term shareholder value creation. 
• Have the majority of each Named Executive Officer's target compensation opportunity at risk, based on Company and individual performance. 
• Strongly align the earnings potential from executive at-risk compensation to what shareholders earn over that same period from their investment in Noble Energy.

2018 Overview of Operational & Financial Performance 
[END TABLE]
2018 was a year of continued progress in positioning the Company to create long-term value for shareholders. Through disciplined capital investment in high return opportunities and ongoing portfolio activity, we generated positive free cash flow which strengthens our robust financial capacity.  Among other things, we successfully conducted operations in an unpredictable commodity price environment and we executed on critical strategic outcomes including the accomplishment of having a majority of Coloradans support oil and gas instead of a setback initiative and our substantial advancement on the Leviathan development.  However, we achieved below target performance on cost and, to a lesser degree, on volumes.  Consistent with our pay for performance strategy, our Compensation Committee considered our significant advancement of strategic outcomes, as well as our shortfalls in reaching cost and volume targets and both absolute and relative share price performance, in determining compensation actions.

2019 Key Compensation Actions - Updated Compensation Benchmarking Peer Group
To enhance the benchmarking process for both our competitive performance and executive compensation, the Compensation Committee identified two peer groups: one for compensation benchmarking purposes and one for Company performance evaluation purposes.  The Committee determined that one singular peer group does not fully meet the needs of our compensation benchmarking and Company performance evaluation process.  The Committee and management believe utilizing a peer group comprised of companies of similar size and scope enhances accuracy in the benchmarking process.  For purposes of compensation benchmarking, the new peer group is balanced with companies both larger and smaller than Noble with the intention to reduce the distortions that smaller and larger companies can create.  As shown below, the following companies were removed from the legacy peer group: EOG Resources Inc., Range Resources Corp., Murphy Oil Corp. and Southwestern Energy.  The following companies were added to the compensation peer group: Concho Resources, Inc., EQT Corp., Encana Corp., Diamondback Energy, Parsley Energy and Cimarex Energy.

2019 Key Compensation Actions - New Performance Peer Group
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a new Performance Peer Group for the purposes of evaluating relative Company performance.  Criteria used to determine this new group included:

• Multi-basin operations 
• Commodity mix  
• International presence

Each year the Compensation Committee assesses the performance metrics driving incentive compensation.  The Compensation Committee considers the strategic direction of the organization, the alignment of metrics with shareholder value creation, and feedback received during our spring and fall shareholder engagement processes. With respect to the STIP metrics, we will replace the U.S. onshore drill & complete rate of return metric with a quantitative capital efficiency metric. The new capital efficiency metric will evaluate the organization's ability to deliver returns by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• optimizing our capital allocation; 
• executing planned projects timely and efficiently; and 
• controlling spend to maintain discipline. 
[END TABLE]
We will also add a new qualitative metric to the STIP assessing Noble's relative performance in each of our operating areas. While the capital efficiency metric focuses on our ability to create value through capital allocation, the Compensation Committee also believes it is important to measure our relative performance in the basins in which we operate.  We strive to differentiate ourselves as industry leading performers in each of our key basins through safe and efficient operations, capital efficiency and returns. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Target Versus Realizable Compensation 
[END TABLE]
The chart below reflects again the  alignment we seek to achieve between executive compensation and Company performance in our total compensation program. Our executives do not achieve target value unless:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the stock price appreciates on an absolute basis; 
• the Company meets or exceeds median industry stock performance; and  
• the Company meets or exceeds important financial and operational goals.   
[END TABLE]
As depicted in the chart below and based on the Company's stock price at December 31, 2018, the realizable value of Mr. Stover's total compensation has averaged 48% across the past three years. 
We believe our compensation program is operating as designed as our below target shareholder return results in below target compensation for our NEOs, demonstrating that our compensation program appropriately aligns pay with performance.

Results of 2018 Say on Pay Vote and Shareholder Engagement 
[END TABLE]
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we held our annual advisory vote on executive compensation. We believe our "say on pay" shareholder votes for 2016, 2017 and 2018 support our approach to executive compensation, at 95.4%, 97.4% and 97.2% favorability, respectively, of shares voted. Our Compensation Committee believes that these votes convey our shareholders' strong support of its decisions and our executive compensation program. Consistent with prior years, in 2018 we completed a robust shareholder engagement program, designed to obtain shareholder feedback and respond to shareholder questions regarding our business strategy, executive compensation philosophy, director independence and diversity, and certain environmental, social and governance issues.  We received positive feedback on the structure of our executive compensation program. In response to valuable shareholder feedback, we continue to enhance the design of our incentive compensation plans.

What We Pay and Why: Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Our compensation program is comprised of three elements: base salary, STIP and LTIP.  By design, a very significant portion of the overall compensation for our Named Executive Officers is performance-based, and the opportunity to realize value depends on both Company and individual performance. The following table summarizes these three elements, as well as our post-employment compensation programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Post-Employment Compensation Programs• Qualified and non-qualified plans• Provide a tax-efficient means to build financial security for retirement• Plans and programs with broad applicability   
[END TABLE]
Base Salary
In determining base salary, the Compensation Committee considers compensation levels and standards within our peer group, the complexity of the role at the Company, and an individual's expertise, experience, and performance.  
Short-Term Incentive Plan
Our STIP is designed to incentivize and reward the achievement of Company performance goals as well as individual performance during the year. The target for each quantitative measure and objective for each qualitative measure considers short-term financial, operational and strategic goals that we believe drive shareholder value.  We attempt to drive and reward achievement of significant performance. Our Compensation Committee reviews information provided by management on actual results for each quantitative measure and qualitative objective.  STIP payouts can range from 0% to 250% of the target opportunity.
The Committee believes that linking pay to operating performance and shareholder value is best achieved by establishing metrics that are both a reflection of how the Company measures business success and how shareholders evaluate total Company performance.  For example, our Company is evaluated internally and externally on its ability to operate efficiently and deliver strong financial returns.  Over 50% of our STIP is linked to cash flow, cost efficiency and returns based measures to align internal and external evaluation of Company performance.  By focusing on metrics that measure our capital allocation and value creation delivery, our incentive plan aligns with shareholder objectives.

[END TABLE]
Our LTIP is designed to provide incentive compensation linked to shareholder value. The Committee historically awards long-term incentive compensation effective on or about February 1 of each year. To further enhance the linkage of executive pay to Company performance, the Compensation Committee increased the performance award component of the LTIP to 50% of the total long-term incentive award.  In addition, the vesting period of the restricted stock component of the long-term incentive award was increased from two to three years to align the vesting period with longer-term Company performance.

Determining Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Role of Compensation Committee
Our executive compensation program and policies are overseen by the independent directors of the Compensation Committee.  In its oversight role, the Compensation Committee is responsible for making compensation decisions involving our CEO and other executive officers.
Role of Management
Given our CEO's direct knowledge of each executive officer's performance and contributions, our Compensation Committee receives an assessment from our CEO on individual performance and suggested compensation levels of other executive officers. The CEO is not present during deliberations by the Compensation Committee regarding his own compensation. All final compensation decisions regarding the compensation of executive officers are made in executive session by the Compensation Committee.
Role of Compensation Consultants
Our Compensation Committee retains, at Company expense, independent consultants to assist it in executive compensation matters. The Compensation Committee met with its consultant numerous times during 2018 in and out of the presence of management, to review findings based on market research and considers those findings in determining and adjusting our executive compensation program.
Our Compensation Committee continued to retain Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") as its independent consultant on executive compensation for 2018, after considering Meridian's independence from our management and members of our Compensation Committee and the following compensation consultant traits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
• effective past performance;
• familiarity with our executive compensation program and the programs of our compensation peer group;
• a comprehensive range of services associated strictly with executive compensation;
• no conflicts of interest; and
• maintenance of policies and procedures that prevent conflicts of interest.
In 2018, Meridian assisted in reviewing our executive compensation program and providing comparative market data and trends on compensation practices and programs based on an analysis of our peer companies. Representatives of Meridian participated in all regular meetings of the Compensation Committee, including executive sessions without management. Meridian also provided consulting services to our Governance Committee in 2018 with respect to our non-employee director total compensation. 
2018 Compensation and Performance Benchmarking Process
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews our executive officers' compensation relative to peers based on information provided by its independent compensation consultant. This information reflects both publicly available information and recently collected market data through Meridian's North America Oil and Gas E&P Compensation Survey. We believe this information provides the Compensation Committee with a strong and sufficient basis to understand the competitive executive compensation landscape.
We believe that our executive compensation program should be internally consistent and equitable. In its review of total compensation, our Compensation Committee considers the relationship between our CEO's total compensation and that of our other Named Executive Officers, as well as the consistency and equity among those Named Executive Officers.
The 2018 benchmarking peer group, utilized for 2018 compensation and performance decisions, is captured below.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anadarko Petroleum Corp.• Apache Corp.• Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.• Chesapeake Energy Corp.• Continental Resources, Inc.• Devon Energy Corp.• EOG Resources, Inc.• Hess Corp.• Marathon Oil Corp.• Murphy Oil Corp.• Pioneer Natural Resources Co.• Range Resources Corp.• Southwestern Energy Co.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the composition of the peer group annually to ensure that it remains relevant for comparative purposes.  As discussed above in 2019 Key Compensation Actions, the Compensation Committee determined that two separate peer groups are appropriate for compensation benchmarking and performance benchmarking.

Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for our officers and non-employee directors that are set out in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.  We believe that these guidelines reinforce the alignment of executive officers and non-employee directors with our shareholders in creating and increasing shareholder value.  Each officer listed below is expected to own shares with a value that is a multiple of the officer's current base salary and each non-employee director is expected to own shares with a value that is a multiple of the director's annual cash retainer, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position Multiple 
Chief Executive Officer 6.0X base salary 
Chief Operating Officer 3.0X base salary 
Chief Financial Officer 3.0X base salary 
Executive Vice President 3.0X base salary 
Senior Vice President 2.5X base salary 
Vice President 2.0X base salary 
Non-Employee Director 5.0X annual cash retainer 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
Holding Requirement
Individuals not meeting these guidelines within five years will be required to retain 50% of any net shares they subsequently acquire upon the vesting of restricted stock and/or the exercise of stock options until the required ownership multiple is met.
On December 3, 2018, our Compensation Committee and Governance Committee reviewed the holdings of our officers and non-employee directors, finding that all of our officers and non-employee directors were in compliance with the guidelines (or, in the case of recently elected officers or non-employee directors, were within the permitted time frame to come into compliance with the guidelines).
Compensation Clawback
Our Compensation Committee has adopted a policy that allows the Company, under certain circumstances (such as a restatement of financial information or reserves or material noncompliance with federal securities laws or the Company's code of conduct), to recoup incentive-based compensation from current or former executive officers.  Our policy will be revised, if appropriate, to conform to any final listing standards that may be adopted by the NYSE under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
Policy on Stock Hedging and Pledging
Our Board has adopted a policy that prohibits our executive officers and directors from pledging shares of Company stock awarded as compensation for service as an employee or director (including shares owned as a result of the exercise of compensatory stock options) as collateral for a loan or hedging such shares through a covered call, collar or other derivative transaction.  On December 18, 2018, as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC approved final rules requiring companies to disclose in their proxy statements any practices or policies regarding the ability of employees or directors to engage in certain hedging transactions with respect to company equity securities. Compliance with new Item 407(i) of Regulation S-K is required in proxy and information statements for the election of directors during fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2019. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the new rules.
Post-Employment Compensation
Our post-employment compensation is provided under qualified and non-qualified savings and retirement plans, a severance plan, and either individual change of control agreements or, alternatively, a change of control plan.
Qualified Defined Contribution Plan
Our qualified defined contribution plan ("401(k) Plan") is a tax-qualified retirement savings plan generally available to our employees, including our Named Executive Officers.  It allows participants to contribute the lesser of up to 50% of their basic compensation or the limit prescribed by the Code.  We match such contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 100% of the first six percent of a participant's eligible compensation.  Participants are 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after three years of service, vesting 34%, 67% and 100% following years one, two and three.
In addition, we make the following age-weighted contribution to the 401(k) Plan for each participant:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Age of Participant Contribution Percentage (Below the FICA Taxable Wage Base) Contribution Percentage (Above the FICA Taxable Wage Base) 
Under 35 4% 8% 
At least 35 but under 48 7% 10% 
At least 48 9% 12% 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
These contributions are cliff vested at 100% after three years of service. The contributions made to our 401(k) Plan by or for a participant are credited to accounts maintained for such participant under the plan. The amounts credited to a participant's account are invested at the direction of the participant in various investment fund options available under the 401(k) Plan, including investment in shares of our common stock.
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan
Our non-qualified deferred compensation plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan") allows executive officers, and certain other employees, to save for retirement in a tax-effective manner.  Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants are allowed to defer portions of their salary and bonus and to receive certain matching, age-weighted and transition contributions that would have been made to our 401(k) Plan if the 401(k) Plan had not been subject to the Code, compensation and contribution limitations.  The Deferred Compensation Plan also provides account balances for those participants who elected to have the lump sum present value of their Restoration Plan benefits converted into an account balance under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
Under this unfunded program, a participant may elect to have his or her accounts credited annually with interest at a rate equal to the greater of 125% of the 120-month rolling average of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes or the 120-month rolling average of the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal or to have their accounts adjusted to reflect the results of an array of notional investment options.
Change of Control Arrangements
We have adopted change of control arrangements for our executive officers and certain other employees. A change of control could result in a material change in the leadership and direction of our Company, creating uncertainties among employees and executive officers in such areas as the continuity of management, continued employment opportunities, and our ability to execute existing programs. These arrangements are intended to preserve morale and productivity and encourage retention in the face of the disruptive impact of an actual or rumored change of control. Based on information provided by our compensation consultant, we believe that these arrangements are common practice and align our executive officer interests with those of our shareholders by enabling our executive officers to consider corporate transactions that are in the best interest of shareholders without undue concern over whether the transactions may jeopardize their continued employment.
The change of control arrangements include provisions regarding severance benefits that our executive officers and certain other employees may be entitled to receive if they are terminated within two years following a change of control. Under these arrangements, if a Named Executive Officer is terminated, including a constructive termination, for any reason (other than for cause, disability or death) within two years after a change of control, then we will pay or provide the following to that Named Executive Officer:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all unpaid salary and expenses; 
• a lump sum equal to a multiple of his or her annual cash compensation (made up of annual salary and bonus) ranging from 2.5 times to 2.99 times such compensation; 
• an amount equal to his or her pro rata target bonus for the then-current year; 
• life, disability, medical and dental insurance benefits, upon his or her written request, ranging among Named Executive Officers from 30 to 36 months or such shorter period until the executive obtains substantially equivalent coverage from a subsequent employer; 
• reimbursement for reasonable fees up to $15,000 for out-placement employment services; and 
• in some cases, continued vesting and exercise of stock options. 
[END TABLE]
If we terminate the Named Executive Officer for cause, no benefit is payable to, or with respect to, that Named Executive Officer under our change of control arrangements. A termination for cause may only be made by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of our Board.
In addition, stock options and restricted stock granted pursuant to our 1992 Plan prior to 2016 generally provide for accelerated vesting of all or a portion of the award upon a change of control of the Company.  Stock options, restricted stock and cash awards granted under the 1992 Plan after 2015, and granted under the 2017 Plan generally provide for accelerated vesting of all or a portion of the award if the participant is terminated for reasons other than cause or resigns for good reason within two years following a change of control.

Severance Benefit Plan
Our Severance Benefit Plan is an unfunded plan that provides for severance benefits to eligible employees, including our executive officers, in certain instances based upon years of completed service. The severance benefits are comprised of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment of two weeks of base salary pay for every year of completed service (including partial years), with a minimum of 12 weeks of pay and a maximum of 52 weeks of pay; 
• a prorated STIP payment based on period of employment during the calendar year of termination; 
• six months of reduced-rate contributions under our medical and dental plans; and 
• 12 weeks of coverage under our employee assistance plan. 
[END TABLE]
Perquisites
We do not consider perquisites to be a material component of our executive compensation. In 2018, certain of our executive officers received minimal personal benefits that have a sound value to our business, such as club membership dues reimbursement and comprehensive physical examinations.
Other Compensation Matters
Health and Welfare Programs
We offer a number of other benefits to our executive officers pursuant to benefit programs that provide for broad-based employee participation. These benefit programs include medical, dental and vision insurance, long- and short-term disability insurance, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, relocation/expatriate programs and services, educational assistance, employee assistance and certain other benefits.
In late 2014, we discontinued retiree healthcare benefits and implemented a buyout of eligible pre-age 65 active employees.  Employees who retired prior to that time and were participating in retiree medical benefits were transitioned to a defined contribution model effective as of January 1, 2016.
Indemnification Agreements
We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our non-employee directors and our executive officers. These agreements provide for us to indemnify such persons against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or executive officers and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of a proceeding as to which they may be indemnified. We also cover such persons under a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy that we choose, in our discretion, to maintain. These indemnification agreements are intended to provide indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and are in addition to any other rights the individual may have under our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and applicable law. We believe these indemnification agreements enhance our ability to attract and retain knowledgeable and experienced executive officers and non-employee directors and are generally consistent with practices in our industry.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Code may limit our ability to deduct annual compensation in excess of $1,000,000 that is paid to our CEO and other Named Executive Officers.  Pursuant to tax law changes effective in 2018, the CFO is included in the executives whose compensation is subject to the limit imposed by Section 162(m), and the exception to Section 162(m)'s $1,000,000 limit for "performance-based compensation" has been eliminated, with the result that, except for "grandfathered" amounts, all taxable compensation paid to our CEO, CFO and other Named Executive Officers in 2019 will be subject to the annual $1,000,000 per person limit on deductibility.  "Grandfathered" amounts that satisfy the "performance-based compensation" exception under prior law include stock options granted under the 1992 Plan that satisfied the performance-based compensation exemption requirements when granted, so long as not materially modified in the future. All other taxable compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers, including performance-based restricted shares and related cash awards granted  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
under the 1992 Plan, all awards granted under the 2017 Plan, all salary and STIP payouts, time-vested restricted stock awards and time-vested cash awards, and certain payments provided for under our change of control arrangements are not exempt from the Section 162(m) deduction limit.
Although we consider tax deductibility in the design and administration of our executive compensation plans and program, we believe that our interests are best served by providing competitive levels of compensation to our Named Executive Officers even if it results in the non-deductibility of certain amounts of compensation under the Code.
Rules under GAAP determine the manner in which we account in our consolidated financial statements for grants of equity-based compensation to our employees. Our accounting policies for equity-based compensation are further discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO.  For our 2017 calculation, we calculated our median employee under the final adopted CEO pay ratio rules. 
The pay ratio calculated by the Company is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC rules and methods for disclosure. Due to estimates, assumptions, adjustments and statistical sampling permitted under the rules, pay ratio disclosures may involve a degree of imprecision and may not be consistent with the methodologies incorporated by other companies.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio Methodology
The Company did not have any major changes in employee compensation or work force population through acquisitions, divestitures, mergers or attrition that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio.  The Company also analyzed the 66 employees, excluded from the calculation in 2017 to determine if  including them would have an impact on the CEO pay ratio.  The Company determined that including the 66 employees in the calculation would not result in a material change to the salary of the median employee. As such, we utilized the same median employee for the analysis for 2018.  The median employee is located in Houston in the accounting and finance function. 
2017 CEO Pay Ratio Methodology
To identify the median of the total annual compensation of all our employees, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We utilized a determination date of October 1, 2017, a date within the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, to enable us to make an identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. 
• Our employee population consisted of 2,219 out of 2,285 employees, including full-time, part-time and temporary employees (summer interns). 
• Part-time and temporary employees represent less than 2% of our total employee population. 
• We excluded 66 employees from our employee population that were added in the CWEI acquisition that closed in April 2017. 
• We annualized approximately 286 employees who did not work for the full 12-month period. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Foreign salaries were converted to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate over the 12-month period. 
• No cost of living adjustments were utilized in the compensation calculation. 
• To identify the median employee, we compared the amount of annualized base salary and cash incentive bonus for each employee as reflected in our internal records. 
• Once the median employee was identified, the total compensation per the chart above was calculated under the same methodology as required by the summary compensation table disclosed elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.  Mr. Stover's total compensation was calculated under the same methodology. 
• Once the median employee was identified, the total realized compensation as disclosed was determined by including CEO actual base pay, actual short-term incentive plan payout for the year, realizable equity value based on NBL share price as of 12/31/17 and all other actual compensation (including non-qualified deferred compensation and other compensation elements as disclosed in the summary compensation table).

Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination of Employment
The tables below estimate the amount of compensation payable to each of our Named Executive Officers upon involuntary termination of employment, termination following a change of control and in the event of disability or death, in each case effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amount of compensation payable to each of our Named Executive Officers can only be determined at the time of his or her separation from the Company. For purposes of this discussion, with respect to the payment of compensation that is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, an individual's termination of employment should be interpreted to mean the date as of which the individual has a "separation from service" for the purposes of Section 409A.  No additional payments to our Named Executive Officers will be triggered upon a voluntary termination event. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Tables 
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon Termination
Upon termination of employment for reasons other than disability, death or in connection with a change of control, each Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive amounts earned during his or her term of employment. Such amounts include:
• amounts credited under our Deferred Compensation Plan;
• unused vacation pay; and
• amounts accrued and vested under our 401(k) Plan.
Payments Made Upon Retirement
In the event of the retirement of a Named Executive Officer, in addition to the items identified above, the Named Executive Officer will have until the earlier of (1) the fifth anniversary of his or her retirement date or (2) the expiration of the remainder of the outstanding 10-year option term, to exercise all stock options that are vested as of his or her retirement date.
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability
In the event of the death or disability of a Named Executive Officer, in addition to the benefits listed under the headings "Payments Made Upon Termination" and "Payments Made Upon Retirement" above, the Named Executive Officer or his or her named beneficiary will receive benefits under our disability plan or payments under our life insurance plan, as appropriate.
Payments Made Upon a Change of Control
We have adopted change of control arrangements for our Named Executive Officers. If a Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated within two years after a change of control, he or she may be entitled to receive certain severance benefits pursuant to the terms of his or her change of control arrangement. These benefits are described more fully under the heading "Change of Control Arrangements" in our CD&A section.

In addition to the payments our Named Executive Officers may receive upon the termination of their employment, they will continue to hold stock options that were vested immediately prior to their termination.  Our Named Executive Officers will also be entitled to receive the vested balance of their contributions to our Deferred Compensation Plan and the 401(k) Plan. 
Other Payment Information
Up to 40 hours of unused vacation carries over from year to year.  We have assumed for purposes of the following table that all Named Executive Officers used all of their vacation during 2018 and would therefore not be entitled to payment for any unused vacation in the event of their termination on December 31, 2018.  In the event of termination during the year, all amounts of unused vacation would be paid based on their respective salary.
Our executive change of control arrangement provides for reimbursement for up to $15,000 of reasonable fees related to out-placement employment services.  We have assumed for purposes of the following table that all Named Executive Officers utilized this benefit.
Our long-term disability benefits are fully insured through Prudential.  Eligibility for benefits is determined by Prudential only after the employee's termination of employment because of a medical condition.  Benefits pay at 66.67% of monthly income, capped at $15,000 per month.  For purposes of the following table, this benefit has been excluded.

(1) Named Executive Officers would not be entitled to a STIP payment for 2018 in the event of their termination of employment on December 31, 2018, other than in the event of a change of control or death. 
(2) Vesting of stock options accelerates in the event of a change of control and in the event of death and disability.  Represents the difference between the exercise price of each stock option and closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($18.76) on all unvested stock options held as of December 31, 2018. 
(3) All unvested shares of restricted stock will be forfeited as a result of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, unless the Board, in its discretion, takes action to accelerate the vesting of those shares.  All unvested shares of time-based restricted stock and a portion of the performance-based restricted stock, including accrued dividends, will vest in the event of termination of employment as a result of a change of control as follows:  Mr. Stover's award for 2017 — 89,035 shares, 2018 — 87,811 shares; Mr. Smolik's award for 2018 — 139,054 shares; Mr. Fisher's award for 2017 — 26,422 shares, 2018 — 31,158 shares; Mr. Elliott's award for 2017 — 16,073 shares, 2018 — 17,562 shares; Ms. Clingman's award for 2018 — 32,493 shares.  All unvested shares of time-based restricted stock and a portion of the performance-based restricted stock, including accrued dividends, will vest in the event of termination of employment as a result of death or disability as follows:  Mr. Stover's award for 2016 — 72,538 shares, 2017 — 104,748 shares, 2018 — 87,811 shares; Mr. Smolik's award for 2018 — 139,054 shares; Mr. Fisher's award for 2016 — 24,012 shares, 2017 — 31,085 shares, 2018 — 31,158 shares; Mr. Elliott's award for 2016 — 11,005 shares, 2017 — 18,506 shares, 2018 — 17,562 shares; Ms. Clingman's award for 2018 — 32,493 shares.  Value is based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($18.76). 
(4) All unvested performance share awards will be forfeited as a result of voluntary or involuntary termination of employment, unless the Board, in its discretion, takes action to accelerate the vesting of those shares.  A portion of the unvested performance share awards, including accrued dividends, will vest in the event of termination of employment as a result of a change of control as follows:  Mr. Stover's award for 2018 — 77,775 shares; Mr. Fisher's award for 2018 — 27,597 shares; Mr. Elliott's award for 2018 — 15,555 shares.  A portion of the unvested performance share award, including accrued dividends, will vest in the event of termination of employment as a result of death or disability as follows:  Mr. Stover's award for 2018 — 125,445 shares; Mr. Fisher's award for 2018 — 44,512 shares; Mr. Elliott's award for 2018 — 25,089 shares.  Value is based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($18.76). 
(5) The Named Executive Officers are not a party to any agreement that provides for a severance payment absent termination of employment following a change of control.  However, in certain instances our Severance Benefit Plan provides for a severance payment  based upon years of completed service and continuation of certain health and welfare benefits.  If the Named Executive Officers are entitled to a severance payment under the plan, they would receive two weeks of pay for every year of service, not to exceed 52 weeks or be less than 12 weeks, plus a prorated STIP payment based on their STIP target percentage.  They would also be able to continue certain health and welfare benefits for six months at the current active employee rates. 
(6) Our Executive Change of Control Plan provides for severance benefits in the event that employment terminates within two years after a change of control.  Under the plan, if any of our Named Executive Officers are terminated following a change of control (other than termination for cause or by reason of death or disability), they are entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to a multiplier of 2.99 for Mr. Stover, and 2.5 for Messrs. Smolik, Fisher, Elliott and Clingman of their annual cash compensation.  Cash compensation for purposes of calculating severance is the sum of annual base salary and the greater of target bonus for the current year and the average STIP paid or payable for the three years prior to the change of control.  They are also entitled to a prorated target STIP payment based on the termination date in the year of the change of control. 
(7) Our Executive Change of Control Plan provides for continued medical, dental, vision and life benefits for a period of 36 months for Mr. Stover and 30 months for each other Named Executive Officer following a change of control with each Named Executive Officer continuing to pay the active premium for the 36 or 30 month period, respectively.  The value reflected is the present value of the total estimated cost for us to provide these benefits. 
(8) We provide group term life insurance coverage equal to two times base salary, capped at $1,000,000. 
(9) Mr. Willingham resigned on October 26, 2018 and therefore has no termination values as of December 31, 2018. Upon Mr. Willingham's resignation, he entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with the Company, providing for certain benefits including: continued vesting of all unvested stock options granted in 2016 and 2017, as well as 1/3 of the stock options granted to him in 2018; continued vesting of performance awards granted in 2016 and 2017; immediate vesting of the 2017 restricted stock grant valued at $318,819, including accrued dividends, and 1/3 of the 2018 restricted stock grant valued at $279,903, including accrued dividends; and a cash severance payment of $2,247,500, subject to compliance with certain customary terms of the agreement, including a non-solicitation covenant that extends through October 19, 2020.

[END TABLE]
Questions and Answers about the Meeting and Voting
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.    What is a Proxy Statement and what is a Proxy? 
[END TABLE]
A proxy statement is a document that the regulations of the SEC require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy.  If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated two of our officers to act as proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders: David L. Stover and Kenneth M. Fisher.
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.    What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial shareholder? 
[END TABLE]
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a shareholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or bank, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.    How do I vote? 
[END TABLE]
By Written Proxy. All shareholders of record can vote by written proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner, you may request a written proxy card or voting instruction form from your bank or broker.
By Telephone or Internet. All shareholders of record can also vote by touch-tone telephone from the U.S. using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or through the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card. Beneficial owners may vote by telephone or Internet if their bank, broker or other nominee makes those methods available, in which case the bank, broker or other nominee will include the instructions with the proxy materials. 
In Person. All shareholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.    What shares are included on the proxy card? 
[END TABLE]
If you are a shareholder of record, you will receive only one proxy card for all the shares of common stock you hold in certificate form, in book-entry form and in any Company benefit plan. If you hold shares of common stock in any Company benefit plan and do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the administrators of the benefit plans will not vote your benefit plan shares.
If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive voting instruction information from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own your shares of common stock.
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.    How do I attend the meeting in person?  What do I need to bring? 
[END TABLE]
You need to bring documentation showing that you owned common stock on the record date, February 22, 2019. You also need to bring a photo ID to gain admission. Please note that the use of cameras, recording equipment, cellular telephones, smartphones or other similar equipment or packages will not be allowed in the meeting room. If you are a beneficial owner, bring the notice or voting instruction form you received from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for admission to the meeting. You may also bring your brokerage statement reflecting your ownership of common stock as of February 22, 2019 with you to the meeting. Please note that you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Questions and Answers about the Meeting and Voting 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.    How can I vote at the meeting if I am a beneficial owner? 
[END TABLE]
You will need to ask your broker, bank or other nominee to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting.  If you do not have a legal proxy with you, you will be able to gain admission to the meeting following the procedures described in the response to question 5, but will not be able to vote at the meeting.  Accordingly, we encourage you to vote your shares in advance, even if you intend to attend the meeting.
Please note that if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.    How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal   Board recommendation 
1.  Election of Directors   FOR each Director Nominee 
2.  Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor   FOR 
3.  Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation   FOR 
4.   Approval of Amended and Restated Noble Energy, Inc. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan from 29,000,000 to 44,000,000   FOR 
8.    How many votes are needed to approve each of the proposals? 
[END TABLE]
Directors in uncontested elections will be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares of our common stock voting in person or by proxy at the meeting. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee. 
Each of the remaining proposals requires approval by holders of a majority of shares of common stock having voting power represented in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. As an advisory vote, the proposal to approve executive compensation is not binding upon the Company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders and will consider the outcomes of those votes when making future compensation and frequency of vote decisions.
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.    What if I am a shareholder of record and do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy?  
9.    What if I am a shareholder of record and do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy?  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders should specify their choice for each matter on the proxy card. If no specific instructions are given, proxies which are signed and returned will be voted in accordance with the Board recommendations described in the response to question 7. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Questions and Answers about the Meeting and Voting 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.    What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker? 
[END TABLE]
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the material you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote.
Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor is a discretionary item. Generally, brokers, banks and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion.
Non-discretionary Items. The election of directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation and the vote to approve an amendment and restatement of the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners. Non-voted stock on non-discretionary matters are called "broker non-votes."
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.    How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted? 
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered as votes cast "for" or "against" any proposal or director candidate and will not affect the outcome of the election of directors.  Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against any matter other than the election of directors.  Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any proposal to be voted on at the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.    What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares? 
[END TABLE]
Shareholders can revoke a proxy prior to the completion of voting at the meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving written notice to the Company's Secretary; 
• delivering a later-dated proxy; or 
• voting in person at the meeting (unless you are a beneficial owner without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.    Are votes confidential? Who counts the votes? 
[END TABLE]
We will not disclose the votes of specific shareholders except:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements or to assert or defend claims for or against the Company; 
• in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; 
• if a shareholder makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management; or  
• to allow the independent inspector of election to certify the results of the vote. 
[END TABLE]
An independent inspector of elections will tabulate the proxies and certify the results.
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.    When will the Company announce the voting results? 
[END TABLE]
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and will report the final results on our website and in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

  15.    Does the Company have a policy about Directors' attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
  15.    Does the Company have a policy about Directors' attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
[END TABLE]
All of our directors are expected to attend each Annual Meeting of our shareholders. Attendance at our Annual Meeting will be considered by our Governance Committee in assessing each director's performance. Last year, all of our directors attended our Annual Meeting, except for Mr. Hedrick and Ms. Williamson who did not stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of our shareholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.    Why did I receive a notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
[END TABLE]
We are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we have sent a notice regarding the availability of these proxy materials rather than a paper copy to most of our shareholders. The notice contains instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet and how to request a paper copy. In addition, the website provided in the notice allows shareholders to request to receive future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail. A shareholder's election to receive proxy materials by mail or e-mail will remain in effect until the shareholder terminates it.
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.    How are proxies solicited and what is the cost? 
[END TABLE]
We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We have engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $15,000 plus expenses. We will bear the reasonable expenses incurred by banks, brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies by mail, telephone and personal contact. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities.
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.    How can I contact the Company Secretary? 
[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement directs certain inquiries to the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary may be contacted by writing to Noble Energy, Inc., Attn: Company Secretary, 1001 Noble Energy Way, Houston, Texas 77070 or by calling (281) 872-3100.

19.    How can I communicate with the Board of Directors? 
[END TABLE]
You may contact any member of our Board, any Board committee or any chair of any such committee by mail, electronically or by calling our independent, toll-free compliance line. To communicate by mail, correspondence should be addressed to our Board or any individual director or group or committee of directors by either name or title.

We will deliver promptly, upon a written or oral request, a separate copy of this Proxy Statement, annual report or Notice to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. Shareholders sharing an address may also submit requests for delivery of a single copy of the Proxy Statement, annual report or Notice, but in such event will still receive separate proxies for each account.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This Proxy Statement includes free cash flow which is an important financial measure, but is not a financial measure defined by GAAP.  We believe it is a useful tool to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow our business and create long-term shareholder value, and it is used as a performance measure for purposes of our STIP.  Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure as reported in accordance with GAAP. Our method for computing this measure may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other entities.
The table below reconciles net cash provided by our operating activities (GAAP) to free cash flow (non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

 NOBLE ENERGY, INC.
2017 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
(Amended and Restated Effective April __, 2019)
ARTICLE I.  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE
1.1    Establishment.  Noble Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Noble"), previously established the Noble Energy, Inc. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan for the benefit of certain officers, employees, consultants and others performing services for Noble and its Affiliates, as set forth in this Plan.
1.2    Purpose.  The purposes of this Plan are to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to perform services for Noble and its Affiliates, to further align the interests of those individuals with those of the stockholders of Noble, and to more closely link compensation with the performance of Noble and its Affiliates.  Noble is committed to creating long-term stockholder value.  Noble's compensation philosophy is based on the belief that Noble can best create stockholder value if officers, employees, consultants and others performing services for Noble and its Affiliates act and are rewarded as business owners.  Noble believes that an equity stake through equity compensation programs effectively aligns service provider and stockholder interests by motivating and rewarding performance that will enhance stockholder value. 
1.3    Effectiveness and Term.  The Plan was originally effective as of April 25, 2017 (the "Effective Date"). This amended and restated Plan shall become effective on the later of (a) the date of its adoption by the Board and (b) the date it is approved by the stockholders of Noble in accordance with applicable law and upon such approval shall supersede the original plan document in its entirety. Unless terminated earlier by the Board pursuant to Section 14.1, this amended and restated Plan shall terminate on the day prior to the tenth anniversary of the earlier of (a) the date of its adoption by the Board and (b) the date it is approved by the stockholders of Noble.

For purposes of this Affiliate definition, the term "controlling interest" has the same meaning as provided in Treasury Regulation § 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i), except that the phrase "at least 50 percent" shall be used instead of the phrase "at least 80 percent" in each place the phrase "at least 80 percent" appears in Treasury Regulation § 1.414(c)-2(b)(2)(i).

(b)    The consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation, in each case, with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of Noble immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own outstanding voting securities representing at least 51% of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors ("Voting Securities") of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company;

(a)    Options and SARs.  The grant of Options shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards under this Plan by the number of shares subject to such an Award.  The grant of SARs that may be paid or settled only in Common Stock, or in either cash or Common Stock (or a combination thereof), shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards under the Plan by the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Award, and any shares of Common Stock not delivered upon exercise of such SARs or portion thereof shall not again be available for grant of Awards under this Plan and shall not be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Plan.  Any grant of SARs or portion thereof that may be paid or settled only for cash shall not affect the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards under the Plan.

Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
(b)    Restricted Stock and Stock Awards.  The grant of Restricted Stock or Stock Awards shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for grant of Awards under this Plan by the product of 2.39 multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such an Award.
(c)    Restricted Stock Units.  The grant of Restricted Stock Units (including those credited to a Participant in respect of a Dividend Equivalent Unit Right) that may be paid or settled (i) only in Common Stock or (ii) in either cash or Common Stock shall reduce the number of shares available for grant of Awards under this Plan by the product of 2.39 multiplied by the number of shares subject to such an Award.  The grant of Restricted Stock Units that may be paid or settled only for cash shall not affect the number of shares available for grant of Awards under this Plan.
(d)    Performance Awards and Other Incentive Awards.  The grant of a Performance Award or Other Incentive Award in the form of Common Stock or that may be paid or settled (i) only in Common Stock or (ii) in either Common Stock or cash shall reduce the number of shares available for grant of Awards under this Plan by the product of 2.39 multiplied by the number of shares subject to such an Award.  The grant of a Performance Award or Other Incentive Award that may be paid or settled only for cash shall not affect the number of shares available for grant of Awards under this Plan.
(e)    Cancellation, Forfeiture and Termination.  If any Award referred to in Section 4.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) (other than an Award that may be paid or settled only for cash) is canceled or forfeited, or terminates, expires or lapses, for any reason, the shares then subject to such Award shall again be available for grant of any Awards under this Plan and shall be added back to the number of shares available for grant on the same numerical basis as was used upon grant to reduce the number of shares available for grant of Awards.
(f)    Payment of Exercise Price and Withholding Taxes.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, shares (i) tendered (either actually or by attestation) or withheld to satisfy an exercise price or tax withholding obligation pertaining to an Award, or (ii) repurchased by Noble using Option proceeds shall not be available for grant of any Awards under this Plan and shall not be added back to the number of shares available for grant under this Plan.
ARTICLE V.  ELIGIBILITY
The Committee shall select Participants from those individuals who are Employees, consultants and other individuals performing services for the Company that, in the opinion of the Committee, are in a position to make a positive contribution to the success of the Company.  Once a Participant has been selected for an Award by the Committee, the Committee shall determine the type and size of Award to be granted to the Participant and shall establish in the related Award Agreement the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the Award, in addition to those set forth in this Plan and the administrative guidelines and regulations, if any, established by the Committee.
ARTICLE VI.  FORM OF AWARDS
6.1    Form of Awards.  Awards may be granted under this Plan, in the Committee's sole discretion, in the form of Options pursuant to Article VII, SARs pursuant to Article VIII, Restricted Stock pursuant to Article IX, Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Article X, Performance Awards pursuant to Article XI and Stock Awards and Other Incentive Awards pursuant to Article XII, or any combination thereof.  All Awards shall be subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations of this Plan.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, subject any Award to such other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations (including without limitation the time and conditions of exercise, vesting or payment of an Award and restrictions on transferability of any shares of Common Stock issued or delivered pursuant to an Award), provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan.   Awards under a particular Article of this Plan need not be uniform, and Awards under more than one Article of this Plan may be combined in a single Award Agreement.  Any combination of Awards may be granted at one time and on more than one occasion to the same Participant.  
C-7
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
6.2    No Repricing or Reload Rights; No Buy-out of "Underwater" Awards.  Except for adjustments made pursuant to Section 4.2, no Award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation or otherwise modified without stockholder approval, if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares underlying such Award.  The Committee may not cancel an outstanding Option or SAR having an exercise price that is known to be more than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in exchange for a cash payment or for the purpose of granting a replacement Award of a different type. 
6.3    Dividends, Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights and Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights.  No Award that provides for the payment or accumulation of dividends, Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights or Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights shall allow such dividends, Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights or Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights to vest or otherwise become payable sooner than the date on which the underlying Award or portion thereof with respect to which it was granted has vested. 
ARTICLE VII.  OPTIONS
7.1General.  Awards may be granted in the form of Options that may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, or any combination of both; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.
7.2Terms and Conditions of Options.  An Option shall be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times as may be determined by the Committee.  The price at which a share of Common Stock may be purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Committee, but such exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Grant Date unless the Option is granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who became Employees (or other service providers) as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition or other corporate transaction involving the Company in a manner that complies with Section 409A with respect to a Nonqualified Stock Option or Section 422 of the Code with respect to an Incentive Stock Option.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.3, the term of each Option shall be as specified by the Committee; provided, however, that no Options shall be exercisable later than 10 years after the Grant Date.  Options may be granted with respect to Restricted Stock or shares of Common Stock that are not Restricted Stock, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
7.3Restrictions Relating to Incentive Stock Options.
(a)    Options granted in the form of Incentive Stock Options shall, in addition to being subject to the terms and conditions of Section 7.2, comply with Section 422(b) of the Code.  To the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the dates the respective Incentive Stock Options are granted) of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an individual during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of Noble and its Affiliates exceeds $100,000, such excess Incentive Stock Options shall be treated as options that do not constitute Incentive Stock Options.  The Committee shall determine, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code, which of a Participant's Incentive Stock Options will not constitute Incentive Stock Options because of such limitation and shall notify the Participant of such determination as soon as practicable after such determination.  The price at which a share of Common Stock may be purchased upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee, but such exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date.  No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to an Employee under this Plan if, at the time such Option is granted, such Employee owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of Noble or of its Affiliates unless (i) on the Grant Date of such Option, the exercise price of such Option is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option and (ii) such Option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the Grant Date of the Option.
(b)    Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option shall notify Noble in writing immediately after the date he or she makes a disqualifying disposition of any shares of Common Stock 
C-8
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Incentive Stock Option.  A disqualifying disposition is any disposition (including any sale) of such Common Stock before the later of (i) two years after the Grant Date of the Incentive Stock Option or (ii) one year after the date of exercise of the Incentive Stock Option.
7.4Exercise of Options.
(a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, Options shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to Noble, setting forth the number of whole shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for such shares.
(b)    Upon exercise of an Option, the exercise price of the Option shall be payable to Noble in full either (i) in cash or an equivalent acceptable to the Committee, (ii) in the sole discretion of the Committee and in accordance with any applicable administrative guidelines established by the Committee, (A) by tendering (either actually or by attestation) one or more previously acquired nonforfeitable, unrestricted shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total exercise price or (B) by surrendering a sufficient portion of the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total exercise price or (iii) in a combination of the forms specified in (i) or (ii) of this subsection.
(c)    To the extent permissible under applicable law, payment of the exercise price of an Option may also be made, in the absolute discretion of the Committee, by delivery to Noble or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable option exercise form together with irrevocable instructions to a broker-dealer to sell or margin a sufficient portion of the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised and deliver the sale or margin loan proceeds directly to Noble to pay the exercise price and any required withholding taxes.
(d)    As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of written notification of exercise of an Option and full payment of the exercise price and any required withholding taxes, Noble shall (i) deliver to the Participant, in the Participant's name or the name of the Participant's designee, a stock certificate or certificates in an appropriate aggregate amount based upon the number of shares of Common Stock purchased under the Option or (ii) cause to be issued in the Participant's name or the name of the Participant's designee, in book-entry form, an appropriate number of shares of Common Stock based upon the number of shares purchased under the Option.
7.5    Termination of Employment or Service.  Each Award Agreement embodying the Award of an Option may set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Option following termination of the Participant's employment or service with the Company.  Such provisions shall be determined by the Committee in its absolute discretion, need not be uniform among all Options granted under this Plan and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment or service.  Except to the extent provided otherwise in a Participant's Award Agreement embodying the Award of an Option, the following termination provisions shall apply with respect to such Award:
(a)    Termination For Cause.  If the employment or service of a Participant shall terminate for Cause, each outstanding Option, whether vested or unvested, held by the Participant shall automatically terminate as of the date of such termination of employment or service, and the right to exercise the Option shall immediately terminate.
(b)    Termination By Reason of Retirement.  In the event of a Participant's Retirement, each outstanding Option held by the Participant shall remain outstanding and may be exercised by the Participant, to the extent vested at the time of the Participant's Retirement, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of five years from the date of such Retirement or (ii) the expiration of the Option.  To the extent an Option is unvested at the time of the Participant's Retirement, the Option shall automatically terminate as of the date of such Retirement, and the right to exercise the Option shall immediately terminate.
C-9
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
(c)    Termination By Reason of Death or Disability.  In the event of a Participant's termination of employment or service on account of death or Disability, each outstanding Option, whether vested or unvested,  held by the Participant shall remain outstanding and may be exercised by the person who acquires the Option by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or by the Participant, as the case may be, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of five years from the date of death or termination on account of Disability or (ii) the expiration of the Option.
(d)    Termination For Reasons Other Than Cause, Retirement, Death or  Disability.  If a Participant's employment or service is terminated under circumstances that are not covered by subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7.5, an Option held by the Participant may be exercised by the Participant, to the extent vested as the time of the Participant's termination, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of one year from the date of such termination or (ii) the expiration of the Option.  To the extent an Option is unvested at the time of the Participant's termination of employment or service, the Option shall automatically terminate as of the date of such termination, and the right to exercise the Option shall immediately terminate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in the case of a Participant's death, an Option will not be treated as an Incentive Stock Option unless at all times beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the day three months (one year in the case of a Participant who is "disabled" within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) before the date of exercise of the Option, the Participant is an employee of Noble or a "parent corporation" or a "subsidiary corporation" of Noble, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f) of the Code, respectively (or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming an option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies).
ARTICLE VIII.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
8.1    General.  The Committee may grant Awards in the form of SARs in such numbers and at such times as it shall determine.  SARs shall vest and be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times as may be determined by the Committee.  The price at which SARs may be exercised shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Grant Date unless the SARs are granted through the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who became Employees (or other service providers) as a result of a merger, consolidation, acquisition or other corporate transaction involving the Company in a manner that complies with Section 409A.  The term of each SAR shall be as specified by the Committee; provided, however, that no SAR shall be exercisable later than 10 years after the Grant Date.  In the case of an SAR that is granted in conjunction with all or a portion of an Option, the SAR shall expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Option.  At the time of an Award of SARs, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the SARs as it determines are necessary or appropriate, provided they are not inconsistent with this Plan.
8.2    Exercise of SARs.  SARs shall be exercised by the delivery of a written notice of exercise to Noble, setting forth the number of whole shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Award is being exercised.  Upon the exercise of SARs, the Participant shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the excess of the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Award is exercised (determined as of the date of such exercise) over the aggregate exercise price of such shares.  Such amount shall be payable to the Participant in cash or in shares of Common Stock, as provided in the Award Agreement.
8.3    Termination of Employment or Service.  Each Award Agreement embodying the Award of SARs may set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the SARs following termination of the Participant's employment or service with the Company.  Such provisions shall be determined by the Committee in its absolute discretion, need not be uniform among all SARs granted under this Plan and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment or service.  Except to the extent provided otherwise in a Participant's Award Agreement embodying the Award of SARs, the following termination provisions shall apply with respect to such Award:
C-10
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
(a)    Termination For Cause.  If the employment or service of a Participant shall terminate for Cause, each outstanding SAR, whether vested or unvested, held by the Participant shall automatically terminate as of the date of such termination of employment or service, and the right to exercise the SAR shall immediately terminate. 
(b)    Termination By Reason of Retirement.  In the event of a Participant's Retirement, each outstanding SAR held by the Participant shall remain outstanding and may be exercised by the Participant, to the extent vested at the time of the Participant's Retirement, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of five years from the date of such Retirement or (ii) the expiration of the SAR.  To the extent an SAR is unvested at the time of the Participant's Retirement, the SAR shall automatically terminate as of the date of such Retirement, and the right to exercise the SAR shall immediately terminate.
(c)    Termination By Reason of Death or Disability.  In the event of a Participant's termination of employment or service on account of death or Disability, each outstanding SAR, whether vested or unvested,  held by the Participant shall remain outstanding and may be exercised by the person who acquires the SAR by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or by the Participant, as the case may be, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of five years from the date of death or termination on account of Disability or (ii) the expiration of the SAR.
(d)    Termination For Reasons Other Than Cause, Retirement, Death or Disability.  If a Participant's employment or service is terminated under circumstances that are not covered by subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8.3, an SAR held by the Participant may be exercised by the Participant, to the extent vested as the time of the Participant's termination, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of one year from the date of such termination or (ii) the expiration of the SAR.  To the extent an SAR is unvested at the time of the Participant's termination of employment or service, the SAR shall automatically terminate as of the date of such termination, and the right to exercise the SAR shall immediately terminate.
ARTICLE IX.  RESTRICTED STOCK
9.1    General.  Awards may be granted in the form of Restricted Stock in such numbers and at such times as the Committee shall determine.  The Committee shall impose such terms, conditions and restrictions on Restricted Stock as it may deem advisable, including without limitation prescribing the period over which and the conditions upon which the Restricted Stock may become vested or be forfeited and/or providing for vesting upon the achievement of specified performance goals pursuant to a Performance Award.  A Participant shall not be required to make any payment for Restricted Stock unless required by the Committee pursuant to Section 9.2.
9.2    Purchased Restricted Stock.  The Committee may in its sole discretion require a Participant to pay a stipulated purchase price for each share of Restricted Stock.
9.3    Restricted Period.  At the time an Award of Restricted Stock is granted, the Committee shall establish a Restricted Period applicable to such Restricted Stock.  Each Award of Restricted Stock may have a different Restricted Period in the sole discretion of the Committee.
9.4    Other Terms and Conditions. 
(a)    Restricted Stock shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock for all corporate purposes.  Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant under this Plan shall be registered in the name of the Participant or, at the option of Noble, in the name of a nominee of Noble, and shall be issued in book-entry form or represented by a stock certificate.  
(b)    At the time of an Award of Restricted Stock, the Committee shall prescribe such terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the Restricted Stock as it may determine in its sole discretion, including without limitation rules pertaining to the termination of employment or service (by 
C-11
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
reason of death, Disability, Retirement, Cause or otherwise) of a Participant prior to expiration of the Restricted Period.  Except to the extent provided otherwise in a Participant's Award Agreement embodying the Award of Restricted Stock, the following termination provisions shall apply with respect to such Award:
(i)    Termination By Reason of Death or Disability.  In the event of a Participant's termination of employment or service prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period on account of death or Disability, the restrictions applicable to the shares of Restricted Stock held by the Participant shall terminate, and as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 60 days) after such termination of employment or service the shares of Restricted Stock, together with any dividends or other distributions with respect to such shares then being held by Noble, shall be delivered to the Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, to the Participant's estate) free of such restrictions.
(ii)    Termination For Reasons Other Than Death or Disability.  If a Participant's employment or service is terminated prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period under circumstances that are not covered by subsection (i) of this Section 9.4(b), then on the date of such termination of employment or service all of the shares of Restricted Stock still subject to restrictions shall be forfeited by the Participant and transferred to the Company at no cost to Noble.
(c)    Except to the extent provided otherwise in a Participant's Award Agreement embodying the Award of Restricted Stock, the following provisions shall apply with respect to such Award:
(i)    Restricted Stock shall be held by Noble in escrow for the Participant's benefit until such time as the Restricted Stock is either forfeited by the Participant to Noble or the restrictions thereon terminate as set forth in the Award Agreement.  The Participant shall not retain physical custody of any certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock issued to the Participant until such time as the restrictions on such shares of Restricted Stock terminate as set forth in the Award Agreement.  The Participant, by acceptance of the Restricted Stock, shall be deemed to appoint Noble and each of its authorized representatives as the Participant's attorney(s)-in-fact to effect any transfer of forfeited shares of Restricted Stock to Noble as may be required pursuant to this Plan or the Award Agreement, and to execute such representations or other documents or assurances as Noble or such representatives deem necessary or advisable in connection with any such transfer.  To the extent allowable by applicable law, Noble, or its designee, shall not be liable for any act it may do or omit to do with respect to holding the shares of Restricted Stock in escrow while acting in good faith in the exercise of its judgment.
(ii)    Subject to the further terms and conditions set forth below, upon the issuance of Restricted Stock to the Participant, the Participant shall become the owner thereof for all purposes and shall have all rights as a stockholder, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends and distributions, with respect to the Restricted Stock.  If Noble shall pay or declare a dividend or make a distribution of any kind, whether due to a reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise, with respect to the shares of Common Stock constituting the Restricted Stock, then Noble shall pay or make such dividend or other distribution with respect to the Restricted Stock; provided, however, that with respect to any of the shares of Restricted Stock that are still subject to the restrictions of the Award Agreement, the cash, stock or other securities and other property constituting such dividend or other distribution pertaining to such Restricted Stock shall be held by Noble subject to the restrictions applicable under the Award Agreement to such Restricted Stock until such shares of Restricted Stock are either forfeited by the Participant and transferred to Noble or the restrictions thereon terminate as set forth in the Award Agreement.  If the shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which such dividend or distribution was paid or made are forfeited by the Participant pursuant to the provisions hereof, then the Participant shall not be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and such dividend or distribution shall likewise be forfeited and transferred to Noble.  If the restrictions applicable to the shares of 
C-12
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock with respect to which such dividend or distribution was paid or made terminate in accordance with the provisions of the Award Agreement, then the Participant shall be entitled to receive such dividend or distribution with respect to such shares, without interest, and such dividend or distribution shall likewise be delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable (but in no event later than 60 days) after the termination of such restrictions.
(iii)    The Participant may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock during the Restricted Period other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  
(d)    Any provision of this Article IX to the contrary notwithstanding, no dividends or distributions made with respect to any share of Restricted Stock shall vest or be payable sooner than the date on which the underlying share of Restricted Stock with respect to which it was made has vested.
(e)    A breach of the terms and conditions established by the Committee pursuant to the Award of the Restricted Stock may result in a forfeiture of the Restricted Stock.  
ARTICLE X.  RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
10.1    General.  Awards may be granted in the form of Restricted Stock Units in such numbers and at such times as the Committee shall determine.  The Committee shall impose such terms, conditions and restrictions on Restricted Stock Units as it may deem advisable, including without limitation prescribing the period over which and the conditions upon which a Restricted Stock Unit may become vested or be forfeited and/or providing for vesting upon the achievement of specified performance goals pursuant to a Performance Award.  Upon the lapse of restrictions with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit, the Participant shall be entitled to receive one share of Common Stock or an amount of cash equal to the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock, as provided in the Award Agreement.  A Participant shall not be required to make any payment for Restricted Stock Units.
10.2    Restricted Period.  At the time an Award of Restricted Stock Units is granted, the Committee shall establish a Restricted Period applicable to such Restricted Stock Units.  Each Award of Restricted Stock Units may have a different Restricted Period in the sole discretion of the Committee.
10.3    Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights and Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights.  To the extent provided by the Committee in its sole discretion, a grant of Restricted Stock Units may include a tandem Dividend Equivalent Cash Right or Dividend Equivalent Unit Right grant.  A grant of Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights shall be paid directly to the Participant at the time of payment of the related dividend, be credited to a bookkeeping account subject to the same vesting and payment provisions as the tandem Award (with or without interest in the sole discretion of the Committee), or be subject to such other provisions or restrictions as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  A grant of Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights shall be subject to the same vesting and payment provisions as the tandem Award or be subject to such other provisions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Any provision of this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding, no Dividend Equivalent Cash Right or Dividend Equivalent Unit Right shall vest or be payable sooner than the date on which the underlying Restricted Stock Unit with respect to which it was granted has vested.
10.4    Other Terms and Conditions.  At the time of an Award of Restricted Stock Units, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe additional terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the Restricted Stock Units, including without limitation rules pertaining to the termination of employment or service (by reason of death, Disability, Retirement, Cause or otherwise) of a Participant prior to expiration of the Restricted Period.  Except to the extent provided otherwise in a Participant's Award Agreement embodying the Award of Restricted Stock Units, the following termination provisions shall apply with respect to such Award:
(a)    Termination By Reason of Death or Disability.  In the event of a Participant's termination of employment or service prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period on account of death

(b)    Termination For Reasons Other Than Death or Disability.  If a Participant's employment or service is terminated prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period under circumstances that are not covered by subsection (a) of this Section 10.4, then on the date of such termination of employment or service all of the Restricted Stock Units still subject to restrictions shall be forfeited by the Participant.
ARTICLE XI.  PERFORMANCE AWARDS
11.1    General.  Awards may be granted in the form of Performance Awards that may be payable in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock or any combination of both, in such amounts and at such times as the Committee shall determine.

12.2    Other Incentive Awards.  Other Incentive Awards may be granted in such amounts, upon such terms and at such times as the Committee shall determine.  Other Incentive Awards may be granted based upon, payable in or otherwise related to, in whole or in part, shares of Common Stock if the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that such Other Incentive Awards are consistent with the purposes of this Plan.  Each grant of an Other Incentive Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the amount of the Other Incentive Award and the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to such Award.  Payment of Other Incentive Awards shall be made at such times and in such form, which may be cash, shares of Common Stock or other property (or any combination thereof), as established by the Committee, subject to the terms of this Plan.
ARTICLE XIII.  CHANGE OF CONTROL
13.1    Vesting of Awards.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event of a Change of Control while a Participant is employed by the Company, followed by the termination of such Participant's employment or service (i) by the Company for reasons other than Cause, or (ii) by the Participant on account of Good Reason, within the 24-month period beginning at the time of the occurrence of the Change of Control (the "Change Effective Time"), each Award outstanding under this Plan to such Participant immediately shall become vested and fully exercisable upon such termination, and any restrictions applicable to the Award shall lapse as of such date; provided, however, that notwithstanding the preceding, any Award that is a Performance Award with performance-based vesting will vest upon such termination of employment or service according to performance achieved as measured through the last day of the month immediately preceding the date of such termination of employment or service.  For purposes of this Section 13.1, in order to terminate on account of Good Reason, Participant must provide written notice to the Company of his or her belief that Good Reason exists within 60 days of the initial existence of the Good Reason condition, and that notice must describe in reasonable detail the condition(s) believed to constitute Good Reason.  The Company then shall have 30 days to remedy the Good Reason condition(s).  If not remedied within that 30-day period, the Participant may submit a notice of termination to the Company; provided, however, that the notice of termination invoking the option to terminate employment for Good Reason must be given no later than 100 days after the date the Good Reason condition first arose; otherwise, the Participant shall be deemed to have accepted the condition(s), or the correction of such condition(s) that may have given rise to the existence of Good Reason.
13.2    Assumption of Awards.  Upon a Change of Control where Noble is not the surviving entity (or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding Options and SARs that are not exercised at or before the Change Effective Time will be assumed by or replaced with comparable options and rights in the surviving entity (or a parent of the surviving entity) in accordance with Section 424 of the Code or Section 409A, as applicable, and other outstanding Awards will be converted into similar awards of the surviving entity (or a parent of the surviving entity).
13.3    Cancellation of Awards.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control of Noble, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, no later than the Change Effective Time, require any Participant holding an Award to surrender such Award in exchange for (a) with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR (whether or not vested), payment by the Company (or a successor), in cash, of an amount equivalent to the excess of the value of the consideration received for each share of Common Stock by holders of Common Stock in connection with such Change of Control (the "Change of Control Consideration") over the exercise price or grant price per share, (b) with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to an Award of Restricted Stock Units or Other Incentive Awards, and related Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights and Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights (if applicable), payment by the Company (or a successor), in cash, of an amount equivalent to the value of any such Dividend Equivalent Cash Rights and Dividend Equivalent Unit Rights plus the value of the Change of Control Consideration for each share covered by the Award, assuming all restrictions or limitations (including risks of forfeiture) have lapsed and (c) with respect to a Performance Award, payment by the Company (or a successor), in cash, of an amount equivalent to the value of such Award, as determined by the Committee, taking into account, to the extent applicable, the Change of Control Consideration, and assuming all performance criteria and other conditions to payment of such Awards are achieved or fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.

ARTICLE XIV.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
14.1    Plan Amendment and Termination.  The Board may at any time suspend, terminate, amend or modify this Plan, in whole or in part; provided, however, that no amendment or modification of this Plan shall become effective without the approval of such amendment or modification by the stockholders of Noble if (a) such amendment or modification increases the maximum number of shares subject to this Plan (except as provided in Article IV) or changes the designation or class of persons eligible to receive Awards under this Plan or (b) counsel for Noble determines that such approval is otherwise required by or necessary to comply with applicable law or the listing requirements of an exchange or association on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted.  An amendment to this Plan generally will not require stockholder approval if it curtails rather than expands the scope of this Plan, nor if it is made to conform this Plan to statutory or regulatory requirements, such as, without limitation, Section 409A.  Upon termination of this Plan, the terms and provisions of this Plan shall, notwithstanding such termination, continue to apply to Awards granted prior to such termination.  Except as otherwise provided herein, no suspension, termination, amendment or modification of this Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under this Plan, without the consent of the Participant (or the Permitted Transferee) holding such Award.
14.2    Award Amendment and Cancellation.  The Committee may amend the terms of any outstanding Award granted pursuant to this Plan, but except as otherwise provided herein, no such amendment shall adversely affect in any material way the Participant's (or a Permitted Transferee's) rights under an outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant (or the Permitted Transferee) holding such Award.  
ARTICLE XV.  MISCELLANEOUS
15.1    Award Agreements.  After the Committee grants an Award under this Plan to a Participant, such award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement setting forth the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations applicable to the Award and such other matters as the Committee may determine to be appropriate.  The Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due to the Participant in connection with any Award; provided, however, that any permitted deferrals shall be structured to meet the requirements of Section 409A.  The terms and provisions of the respective Award Agreements need not be identical.  All Award Agreements shall be subject to the provisions of this Plan, and in the event of any conflict between an Award Agreement and this Plan, the terms of this Plan shall govern.  All Awards under this Plan are intended to be structured in a manner that will either comply with or be exempt from Section 409A so that no tax will be owed under Section 409A.
15.2    Listing; Suspension.
(a)    If and as long as the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange or system sponsored by a national securities association, the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be conditioned upon such shares being listed on such exchange or system.  Noble shall have no obligation to issue such shares unless and until such shares are so listed, and the right to exercise any Option or other Award with respect to such shares shall be suspended until such listing has been effected.
(b)    If at any time counsel to Noble or its Affiliates shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award is or may in the circumstances be unlawful under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, Noble or its Affiliates shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act, or otherwise, with respect to shares of Common Stock or Awards, and the right to exercise any Option or other Award shall be suspended until, in the opinion of such counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful.
(c)    Upon termination of any period of suspension under this Section 15.2, any Award affected by such suspension that shall not then have expired or terminated shall be reinstated as to all 
C-16
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
shares available before such suspension and as to shares that would otherwise have become available during the period of such suspension, but no such suspension shall extend the term of any Award unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
15.3    Additional Conditions.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary (a) the Committee may, if it shall determine it necessary or desirable in its sole discretion, at the time of grant of any Award or the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Award, require the recipient of the Award or such shares of Common Stock, as a condition to the receipt thereof, to deliver to Noble a written representation of present intention to acquire the Award or such shares of Common Stock for his own account for investment and not for distribution, (b) the certificate for shares of Common Stock issued to a Participant may include any legend that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer and (c) all certificates for shares of Common Stock delivered under this Plan shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC, any stock exchange or association upon which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted, any applicable federal or state securities law, and any applicable corporate law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
15.4    Transferability.
(a)    All Awards granted to a Participant shall be exercisable during his lifetime only by such Participant, or if applicable, a Permitted Transferee as provided in subsection (c) of this Section 15.4; provided, however, that in the event of a Participant's legal incapacity, an Award may be exercised by his guardian or legal representative.  When a Participant dies, the personal representative, beneficiary, or other person entitled to succeed to the rights of the Participant may acquire the rights under an Award.  Any such successor must furnish proof satisfactory to Noble of the successor's entitlement to receive the rights under an Award under the Participant's will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.4, no Award shall be subject to execution, attachment or similar process, and no Award may be sold, transferred, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, other than by will or pursuant to the applicable laws of descent and distribution.  Any attempted sale, transfer, pledge, exchange, hypothecation or other disposition of an Award not specifically permitted by this Plan or the Award Agreement shall be null and void and without effect.
(c)    If provided in the Award Agreement, Nonqualified Stock Options may be transferred by a Participant to a Permitted Transferee.  For purposes of this Plan, "Permitted Transferee" means (i) a member of a Participant's immediate family or a person sharing a Participant's household (other than a tenant or an employee), (ii) trusts in which the Participant or a person listed in (i) above has more than 50% of the beneficial interest, (iii) a foundation in which the Participant or a person listed in (i) above controls the management of assets, (iv) any other entity in which the Participant or a person listed in (i) above owns more than 50% of the voting interests, provided that in the case of the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), no consideration is provided for the transfer and (v) any transferee permitted under applicable securities and tax laws as determined by counsel to Noble.  In determining whether a person is a "Permitted Transferee," immediate family members shall include a Participant's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships.
(d)    Incident to a Participant's divorce, the Participant may request that Noble agree to observe the terms of a domestic relations order which may or may not be part of a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code) with respect to all or a part of one or more Awards made to the Participant under this Plan.  Noble's decision regarding such a request shall be made by the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, based upon the best interests of Noble.  The Committee's decision need not be uniform among Participants.  As a condition of participation, a 
C-17
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
Participant agrees to hold Noble harmless from any claim that may arise out of Noble's observance of the terms of any such domestic relations order.
15.5    Withholding Taxes.  The Company shall be entitled to deduct from any payment made under this Plan, regardless of the form of such payment, the amount of all applicable income and employment taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payment, may require the Participant to pay or may allow the Participant to elect to pay to the Company such withholding taxes prior to and as a condition of the making of any payment or the issuance or delivery of any shares of Common Stock under this Plan, and shall be entitled to deduct from any other compensation payable to the Participant any withholding obligations with respect to Awards.  In accordance with any applicable administrative guidelines it establishes, the Committee may allow a Participant to pay the amount of taxes required by law to be withheld from or with respect to an Award by (a) withholding shares of Common Stock from any payment of Common Stock due as a result of such Award, or (b) permitting the Participant to deliver to the Company (either actually or by attestation) previously acquired shares of Common Stock, in each case having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such required withholding taxes.  No payment shall be made and no shares of Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to any Award unless and until the applicable tax withholding obligations have been satisfied.
15.6    No Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Award granted hereunder.  If the application of any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement would yield a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share, provided that the Committee in its sole discretion may settle fractional shares in cash.
15.7    Notices; Method of Delivery.  All notices required or permitted to be given or made under this Plan or pursuant to any Award Agreement (unless provided otherwise in such Award Agreement) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made if (a) delivered personally, (b) transmitted by first class registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) sent by prepaid overnight courier service or (d) sent by telecopy or facsimile transmission, with confirmation receipt, to the person who is to receive it at the address that such person has theretofore specified by written notice delivered in accordance herewith.  Such notices shall be effective (i) if delivered personally or sent by courier service, upon actual receipt by the intended recipient, (ii) if mailed, upon the earlier of five days after deposit in the mail or the date of delivery as shown by the return receipt therefore or (iii) if sent by telecopy or facsimile transmission, when the answer back is received.  Noble or a Participant may change, at any time and from time to time, by written notice to the other, the address that it or such Participant had theretofore specified for receiving notices.  Until such address is changed in accordance herewith, notices hereunder or under an Award Agreement shall be delivered or sent (A) to a Participant at his address as set forth in the records of the Company or (B) to Noble at the principal executive offices of Noble clearly marked "Attention:  General Counsel."  Any provision of this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, any provision in this Plan setting forth a requirement for delivery of a written notice, agreement, consent, acknowledgement, or other documentation in writing, including a written signature, may be satisfied by electronic delivery of such notice, agreement, consent, acknowledgment, or other documentation, in a manner that the Committee has prescribed or that is otherwise acceptable to the Committee, provided that evidence of the intended recipient's receipt of the electronic delivery is available to the Committee and that such delivery is not prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.
15.8    Compliance with Law and Stock Exchange or Association Requirements.  It is the intent of Noble that Options designated Incentive Stock Options comply with the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code, and that all Awards either be exempt from Section 409A or, if not exempt, comply with the requirements of Section 409A.  Any provision of this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, the Committee may revoke any Award if it is contrary to law, governmental regulation or stock exchange or association requirements or modify an Award to bring it into compliance with any government regulation or stock exchange or association requirements.    
15.9    Clawback.  By accepting or exercising any Award granted under the Plan, the Participant agrees to abide and be bound by any policies adopted by Noble, including without limitation Noble's compensation recoupment policy as contained in Noble's Code of Conduct, as amended from time to time, and any other 
C-18
[BEGIN TABLE]
Appendix C 
[END TABLE]
policies adopted to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or exchange listing standards promulgated thereunder, providing for the repayment and/or forfeiture of any Award or payment resulting from an accounting restatement or similar circumstances.  Such repayment and/or forfeiture provisions shall apply whether or not the Participant is employed by or affiliated with the Company.
15.10    Binding Effect.  The obligations of Noble under this Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization resulting from the merger, consolidation or other reorganization of Noble, or upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets and business of Noble.  The terms and conditions of this Plan shall be binding upon each Participant and his Permitted Transferees, heirs, legatees, distributees and legal representatives.
15.11    Severability.  If any provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Plan or such agreement, as the case may be, but such provision shall be fully severable and this Plan or such agreement, as the case may be, shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein or therein.
15.12    No Restriction of Corporate Action.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to prevent Noble or any Affiliate from taking any corporate action (including any corporate action to suspend, terminate, amend or modify this Plan) that is deemed by Noble or such Affiliate to be appropriate or in its best interest, whether or not such action would have an adverse effect on this Plan or any Awards made or to be made under this Plan.  No Participant or other person shall have any claim against Noble or any Affiliate as a result of such action.
15.13    Governing Law.  This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws (and not the principles relating to conflicts of laws) of the State of Texas except as superseded by applicable federal law.
15.14    No Right, Title or Interest in Company Assets.  No Participant shall have any rights as a stockholder of Noble as a result of participation in this Plan until the date of issuance of Common Stock in his name and, in the case of Restricted Stock, unless and until such rights are granted to the Participant pursuant to this Plan.  To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under this Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, and such person shall not have any rights in or against any specific assets of the Company.  All Awards shall be unfunded.
15.15    Risk of Participation.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed either as a guarantee by Noble or its Affiliates, or their respective stockholders, directors, officers or employees, of the value of any assets of this Plan or as an agreement by Noble or its Affiliates, or their respective stockholders, directors, officers or employees, to indemnify anyone for any losses, damages, costs or expenses resulting from participation in this Plan.
15.16    No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.  No person connected with this Plan in any capacity, including without limitation Noble and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees, makes any representation, commitment or guarantee that any tax treatment, including without limitation federal, state and local income, estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to any Awards or payments thereunder made to or for the benefit of a Participant under this Plan or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant on account of participation in this Plan.
15.17    Continued Employment or Service.  Nothing contained in this Plan or in any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Participant the right to continue in the employ or service of the Company, or interfere in any way with the rights of the Company to terminate a Participant's employment or service at any time, with or without cause.  The loss of existing or potential profit in Awards will not constitute an element of damages in the event of termination of employment or service for any reason, even if the termination is in violation of an obligation of Noble or an Affiliate to the Participant.
