EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
Our executive compensation program is generally designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward highly qualified and talented executive officers     that will enable us to drive long-term stockholder value.
The core principles of our executive compensation program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 ✓   Targeting fixed compensation at the market median; and  
 ✓   Targeting performance-based award levels at the market median and setting maximum award levels, if earned, at or above the market 75th percentile, thereby              emphasizing performance-based compensation elements, with superior performance resulting in above-market pay, and underwhelming performance resulting in below-market pay.  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION BEST PRACTICES
Our compensation practices include many best practices that support our executive compensation objectives and principles and benefit our     stockholders.

Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
CENTURY COMMUNITIES AMENDED AND RESTATED 2017 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
The Board has approved the Century Communities, Inc. Amended and Restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the "amended 2017     plan").  The amended 2017 plan incorporates an amendment to the number of shares of Century common stock available for issuance under the plan by an additional 1.631 million shares.  Our continuing ability to offer equity incentive awards under the     2017 plan is critical to our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, particularly as we grow and in light of the highly competitive markets for employee talent in which we operate.
In addition, the amended 2017 plan reflects certain changes in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its impact on Section 162(m) of the Internal     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  We retained, however, the annual award limits and performance measures as part of good corporate governance.  The amended 2017 plan also incorporates a more stringent limit on non-employee director awards limiting     overall non-employee director compensation to $400,000 per year or $600,000 in the case of a non-employee chairman of the board or lead director.  Finally, the amended 2017 plan increases the limit on incentive stock options commensurate with the     overall share increase and expands the exceptions to the minimum vesting provision to allow for shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash awards and vesting on director awards tied to the timing of the next annual meeting of stockholders which may     be less than one year from the date of grant so long as the annual meeting is more than 50 weeks after the preceding year's annual meeting.
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the     approval of the amended 2017 plan.

We currently are not aware of any business that will be presented at the Annual Meeting other than as described in this proxy statement.  If,     however, any other matter is properly brought at the Annual Meeting, or any continuation, postponement, or adjournment thereof, your proxy includes discretionary authority on the part of the individuals appointed to vote your shares or act on those     matters in accordance with their best judgment.
WHO CAN ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING?          
All of our stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting may attend the Annual Meeting.  If your shares are held in street name, however, you     may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the record holder of your shares.
Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Stockholders who wish to attend the Annual Meeting will be required to present verification of ownership of our common stock, such as a bank or     brokerage firm account statement, and will be required to present a valid government-issued picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to gain admittance to the Annual Meeting.  No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices,     large bags, briefcases, or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting.
WHO IS ENTITLED TO VOTE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?          
Holders of record of shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value, as of the close of business on March 14, 2019, the record date, will be entitled to     notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any continuation, postponement, or adjournment thereof.  At the close of business on the record date, there were 30,297,398 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.  Each     share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on any matter presented to stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
HOW MANY SHARES MUST BE PRESENT?          
A quorum must be present at the Annual Meeting for any business to be conducted.  The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the     holders of a majority in voting power of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum.  Your shares will be counted toward the quorum if you submit a proxy or vote at the Annual Meeting.      Shares represented by proxies marked "abstain" and "broker non-votes" also are counted in determining whether a quorum is present.
WHAT IF A QUORUM IS NOT PRESENT?          
If a quorum is not present or represented at the scheduled time of the Annual Meeting, (i) the chairperson of the Annual Meeting or (ii) a majority     in voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the Annual Meeting until a quorum is present or represented.
HOW DO I VOTE?          
We recommend that stockholders vote by proxy even if they plan to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person.  If you are a stockholder of record,     there are three ways to vote by proxy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· by Telephone—You can vote by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 and following the instructions on the proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· by Internet—You can vote over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following                the instructions on the Internet Notice or proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· by Mail—You can vote by mail by signing, dating, and mailing the proxy card, which you may have received by mail.  
[END TABLE]
Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight     Savings Time, on May 7, 2019.  If you vote through the Internet, you should be aware that you may incur costs to access the Internet, such as usage charges from telephone companies or Internet service providers, and that these costs must be borne by     you.
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you will receive instructions on how to vote from the bank, broker,     or holder of record.  You must follow the instructions of such bank, broker, or holder of record in order for your shares to be voted.  Telephone and Internet voting also may be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers.      If your shares are not registered in your own name and you would like to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your bank, broker, or agent to obtain a legal proxy or the bank's or broker's proxy card and bring it to the     Annual Meeting in order to vote.
Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A "RECORD HOLDER" AND HOLDING SHARES IN "STREET     NAME"?          
A record holder holds shares in his or her name.  Shares held in "street name" means that shares are held in the name of a bank or broker on a     person's behalf.
CAN I VOTE IF MY SHARES ARE HELD IN "STREET NAME"?          
Yes.  If your shares are held by a bank or a brokerage firm, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares held in "street name."  If     your shares are held in street name, these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank or brokerage firm along with a voting instruction card.  As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank or brokerage firm how to vote     your shares, and your bank or brokerage firm is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions.
WHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES?          
Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker in "street name" for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular     proposal because the broker (1) has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and (2) lacks discretionary voting power to vote those shares.
A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on routine matters.  The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as     our independent registered public accounting firm in Proposal No. 2 is a routine matter; and accordingly, a broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on that proposal, without instructions from such beneficial owner.  On the other     hand, absent instructions from a beneficial owner, a broker is not entitled to vote shares held for such beneficial owner on non-routine matters.  We believe, based on the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), that the election of directors in     Proposal No. 1, the amendment to the Century Communities, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan in Proposal No. 2 and the advisory vote on executive compensation in Proposal No. 4 are non-routine matters; and accordingly, brokers do not have authority to     vote on such matters absent instructions from beneficial owners.  Whether a voting proposal is ultimately determined routine or non-routine is determined by the NYSE.  Accordingly, if beneficial owners desire not to have their shares voted by a broker     in a certain manner, they should give instructions to their brokers as to how to vote their shares.
Broker non-votes count for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
HOW DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND I VOTE?          
The Board recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· FOR the election of Dale Francescon, Robert J. Francescon, John P. Box, Keith R. Guericke, and James M. Lippman to serve as members of the Board until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their                successors are duly elected and qualified;

From time to time, the Board, upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, reviews and updates the Corporate Governance     Guidelines as it deems necessary and appropriate.
Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Under the listing standards and rules of the NYSE, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company's board of directors.  In     addition, NYSE rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent.  Audit committee members must also satisfy heightened     independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and compensation committee members must satisfy heightened independence criteria set forth in the NYSE rules.  Under the NYSE rules, a director will only qualify     as an "independent director" if the company's board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in     carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
The Board has undertaken a review of its composition, the composition of its Board committees, and the independence of each director.  Based upon     information requested from and provided by each of our directors concerning his background, employment, and affiliations, including family relationships with us, our senior management, and our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board     has determined that all but two of our directors, Dale Francescon and Robert J. Francescon, are independent directors under the standards established by the SEC and the NYSE.  In making this determination, the Board considered the current and prior     relationships that each non-employee director has with Century and all other facts and circumstances the Board deemed relevant in determining their independence.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE          
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board does not require the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief     Executive Officers, and that the Board is free to choose its Chairman of the Board in any way that it deems best for the Company at any given point in time.  Dale Francescon serves as Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and Robert J.     Francescon serves as Co-Chief Executive Officer and President.  However, the Board endorses the concept of an independent director being in a position of leadership and, thus, as mentioned above, Keith R. Guericke serves as our presiding director.
The Board has determined that this current leadership structure is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at this     time for several reasons, including: (i) Both Dale Francescon's and Robert J. Francescon's extensive knowledge of our Company, business, and industry, obtained through their 15 years of service to our Company and over 25 years of experience in the     homebuilding industry, which benefit Board leadership and the Board's decision-making process through their active roles as Co-Chief Executive Officers, and in the case of Dale Francescon, Chairman of the Board; (ii) unification of Board leadership and     strategic direction as implemented by our management; and (iii) appropriate balance of risks relating to concentration of authority through the oversight of our independent and engaged presiding independent director and Board.
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS          
Our non-management independent directors have the opportunity to meet in executive sessions without management to consider such matters as they deem     appropriate, such as reviewing the performance of management.  Executive sessions of our independent directors are typically held in conjunction with regularly scheduled Board meetings.
Our independent directors have appointed an independent director (referred to as the "presiding director") to preside over the executive sessions of     the independent directors.  The main duties of the presiding director are to (i) preside at regularly scheduled executive sessions or other meetings of the independent directors; (ii) serve as liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the Co-Chief     Executive Officers, on the one hand, and the independent directors, on the other hand, by means of consulting with the Chairman of the Board and the Co-Chief Executive Officers as to agenda items for Board and committee meetings and advising them of     the outcome of such meetings, as necessary; and (iii) coordinate with Board committee chairs in the development and recommendations of Board and Board committee meeting agendas.
Century Communities, Inc. –         2019 Proxy Statement  
Keith R. Guericke serves as our presiding director.

The Audit Committee reviews and evaluates, at least annually, the performance of the Audit Committee, including compliance with its charter.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE          
The Compensation Committee is comprised of our three independent directors, John P. Box, Keith R. Guericke, and James M. Lippman, each of whom the     Board has determined satisfies the heightened independence criteria for compensation committee members under the NYSE rules.  In addition, each of the Compensation Committee members is a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under     the Exchange Act and a an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code).  Mr. Lippman serves as Chair of the Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee, pursuant to its written charter, among other matters:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· administers, reviews, and makes recommendations to the Board regarding our compensation plans, including the Century Communities, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and                administers or oversees all such plans and discharges any responsibilities imposed on the Compensation Committee by such plans, including, without limitation, the grant of equity-based awards to officers and employees;

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Century Communities, Inc. –         2019 Proxy Statement  
The Compensation Committee charter authorizes the Compensation Committee to retain a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel, and other     advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.  During 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook) as its external compensation consultant to provide certain services related to     executive and non-employee director compensation.
The Compensation Committee considers analysis and advice from FW Cook when making compensation decisions and when making decisions on plan design.      Specifically, the Compensation Committee relies on FW Cook for, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· reviewing total compensation strategy and pay levels for our executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· examining our executive compensation program to ensure that it supports our business strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· performing competitive analyses of non-employee director compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· providing advice with respect to our equity-based compensation plans.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may request information or advice directly from FW Cook and may direct our management to provide or solicit information.      A representative of FW Cook regularly interacts with our management and from time to time attends Compensation Committee meetings.
During 2018, FW Cook did not provide any services to the Company unrelated to executive or director compensation.  After considering the relevant     factors, the Compensation Committee determined that no conflicts of interest have been raised in connection with the services FW Cook performed for the Compensation Committee in 2018.
The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates, at least annually, the performance of the Compensation Committee, including compliance with its     charter.
NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE          
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is comprised of our three independent directors, John P. Box, Keith R. Guericke, and James M.     Lippman.  Mr. Box serves as Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee     also has authority to obtain advice and assistance from any outside legal expert or other advisors as it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and evaluates, at least annually, the performance of the Nominating and Corporate     Governance Committee, including compliance with its charter.
BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEETINGS; ATTENDANCE          
The Board held 6 meetings during 2018.  The Audit Committee held 8 meetings, the Compensation Committee held 6 meetings, and the Nominating and     Corporate Governance Committee held 4 meetings during 2018.  All directors attended at least 75% of the combined total of (i) all Board meetings and (ii) all meetings of committees of the Board of which the director was a member during 2018.
We expect all of our directors to attend our annual meeting of stockholders and we customarily schedule a regular Board meeting on the same day as     our annual meeting.  All directors serving at the time of our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 9, 2018 were in attendance.
BOARD DIVERSITY          
The Board of Directors understands the importance of adding diverse, experienced talent to the Board in order to establish an array of experience and     strategic views. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is committed to refreshment efforts to ensure that the composition of the Board and each of its committees encompasses a wide range of perspectives and knowledge.
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND NOMINATIONS PROCESS          
The Board seeks to ensure that the Board is composed of members whose particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, when taken     together, will allow the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively.  New directors are approved by the Board after recommendation by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  In identifying candidates for director, the     Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board take into account the following: (i) the comments and recommendations of Board members regarding the qualifications and effectiveness of the existing Board, or additional qualifications that     may be required when selecting new Board members; (ii) the requisite expertise and sufficiently diverse backgrounds of the Board's overall membership composition; (iii) the independence of outside directors and other possible conflicts of interest of     existing and potential members of the Board; and (iv) any other factors they consider appropriate.  When considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board to     satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of the Company's business and structure, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board focused primarily on the information discussed in each of the directors' individual     biographies.
Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended to it by our stockholders.  Those candidates must be     qualified and exhibit the experience and expertise required of the Board's own pool of candidates, as well as have an interest in our business, and demonstrate the ability to attend and prepare for Board, committee, and stockholder meetings.  Any     candidate must state in advance his or her willingness and interest in serving on the Board. Candidates should represent the interests of all stockholders and not those of a special interest group.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee     will evaluate candidates recommended by stockholders using the same criteria it uses to evaluate candidates recommended by others as described above.  A stockholder that desires to nominate a person for election to the Board at a meeting of     stockholders must follow the specified advance notice requirements contained in, and provide the specific information required by, our Bylaws, as described under "Other           Matters—Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders" later in this proxy statement.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, we made no material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may     recommend nominees to the Board as described in last year's proxy statement.
BOARD ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT          
Risk is inherent with every business.  We face a number of risks, including financial (accounting, credit, interest rate, liquidity, and tax),     operational, political, strategic, regulatory, compliance, legal, competitive, and reputational risks.  Our management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks faced by us, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has     responsibility for the oversight of risk management.  In its risk oversight role, the Board ensures that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.  The Board oversees risks through     the establishment of policies and procedures that are designed to guide daily operations in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and risks acceptable to us.  Our Co-Chief Executive Officers are members of the Board and regularly     attend Board meetings and discuss with the Board the strategies and risks facing our Company.
One of the key functions of the Board is informed oversight of our risk management process.  The Board administers this oversight function directly,     with support from its three standing committees (the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee), each of which addresses risks specific to its respective areas of oversight.  In particular, the     Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management takes to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk     assessment and management is undertaken.  The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function.  The Compensation Committee assesses and monitors     whether any of our compensation policies and programs have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides risk oversight with respect to corporate governance matters.
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS          
The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our officers, directors, and any employees.  Among other matters, our     Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in our communications with and reports to our stockholders, including reports filed with the SEC, and other public                communications;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to appropriate persons identified in the code; and  
[END TABLE]
Century Communities, Inc.         – 2019 Proxy Statement  
[BEGIN TABLE]
· accountability for adherence to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  
[END TABLE]
In November 2018, we amended and restated the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to update, clarify and strengthen its provisions.
Any waiver of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for our executive officers, directors, or any employees may be made only by the Nominating and     Corporate Governance Committee and will be promptly disclosed as required by law and NYSE rules.  We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements of Item 5.05 of Form 8-K and applicable NYSE rules regarding amendments to or waivers from any provision     of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information in the "Investors—Corporate Governance—Governance Documents" section of our website located at www.centurycommunities.com.
COMPLAINT PROCEDURES          
We maintain procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters and to allow     for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.  A 24-hour, toll-free, confidential ethics hotline and a confidential web-based reporting tool are available for the     submission of concerns regarding these and other matters by any employee.  Concerns and questions received through these methods relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters are promptly brought to the attention of the     Chair of the Audit Committee and are handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee.  Complete information regarding our complaint procedures is contained within our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is described     above and may be accessed on our website as noted above.            
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT          
We are committed to a robust and proactive stockholder engagement program.  The Board values the perspectives of our stockholders, and feedback from     stockholders on our business, corporate governance, executive compensation, and sustainability practices are important considerations for Board discussions throughout the year.  During 2018, our executives held more than 200 meetings with stockholders     representing over 70 percent of shares outstanding, in total, including all of our top 10 shareholders that are actively managed funds.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Century Communities, Inc. –         2019 Proxy Statement  
BOARD AND COMMITTEE SELF-EVALUATIONS          
The Board recognizes that a thorough evaluation process is an important element of corporate governance and enhances the effectiveness of the full     Board and each committee.  Therefore, each year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the evaluation process to ensure that the full Board and each committee conduct an assessment of their performance and solicit feedback for     areas of improvement.
SUCCESSION PLANNING          
The Board of Directors recognizes that one of its most important responsibilities is to ensure excellence and continuity in our senior leadership by     overseeing the development of executive talent and planning for the effective succession of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and the other members of our management team.  This responsibility is reflected in the Company's Corporate Governance     Guidelines, which provide for a review of CEO succession planning and management development, and the charter of the Compensation Committee, which requires the Compensation Committee to assist the Board in developing and evaluating potential candidates     for executive officer positions and overseeing the development of executive succession plans, which will include transitional leadership in the event of an unplanned vacancy.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the Co-Chief Executive Officers provide an annual succession planning report to the Compensation Committee, which     summarizes the overall composition of our senior leadership team, including their professional qualifications, tenure, and work experience.  The report also identifies internal members of the management team who are viewed as potential successors to     the Co-Chief Executive Officers.  Succession planning is also regularly discussed in executive sessions of the Board of Directors.  Our directors become familiar with internal potential successors for key leadership positions through various means,     including the annual succession planning report and Board of Directors and committee meetings, and less formal interactions throughout the course of the year.
Additionally, the Board of Directors, with support and recommendations from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, oversees the     succession of its members.  To this end, at least once a year, in connection with the annual director nomination and re-nomination process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates each director's performance, relative strengths and     weaknesses, and future plans, including any personal retirement objectives and the potential applicability of the Company's retirement policy for directors (which is set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines).  As part of that     evaluation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also identifies areas of overall strength and weakness with respect to its composition and considers whether the Board of Directors as a whole possesses core competencies in the areas of     accounting and finance, industry knowledge, management experience, sales and marketing, strategic vision, compensation, and corporate governance, among others.
COMMITTEE CHARTERS AND OTHER INFORMATION

Century Communities, Inc. –         2019 Proxy Statement  
PROPOSAL NO. 2:CENTURY COMMUNITIES, INC. AMENDED AND RESTATED 2017 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
BACKGROUND AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
On March 12, 2019, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved, subject to approval by our stockholders, the     Century Communities, Inc. Amended and Restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the "amended 2017 plan").  The amended 2017 plan incorporates an amendment to the number of shares of Century common stock available for issuance under the     plan by an additional 1.631 million shares.  Our continuing ability to offer equity incentive awards under the 2017 plan is critical to our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel, particularly as we grow and in light of the highly     competitive markets for employee talent in which we operate.
In addition, the amended 2017 plan reflects certain changes in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and its impact on Section 162(m) of the Internal     Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as "Section 162(m)").  These changes essentially eliminate language in the 2017 plan that was included to allow us to qualify certain compensation as "performance-based compensation" under Section     162(m).  We have retained, however, the annual award limits and performance measures as part of good corporate governance.
The amended 2017 plan also incorporates a more stringent limit on non-employee director awards.  The proposed amended 2017 plan contains an overall     non-employee director compensation limit of $400,000 per year or $600,000 in the case of a non-employee chairman of the board or lead director.
Finally, the amended 2017 plan increases the limit on incentive stock options commensurate with the overall share increase and expands the exceptions     to the minimum vesting provision to allow for shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash awards and vesting on director awards tied to the timing of the next annual meeting of stockholders which may be less than one year from the date of grant so     long as the annual meeting is more than 50 weeks after the preceding year's annual meeting.
If our stockholders approve the amended 2017 plan, the amended 2017 plan will become effective as of the date of stockholder approval.  If our     stockholders do not approve the amended 2017 plan, the 2017 plan, as currently in effect, will remain in effect until it terminates in accordance with its terms.
REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDED 2017 PLAN
The Board recommends a vote "FOR"     approval of the amended 2017 plan because the Board believes the proposed amended 2017 plan is in the best interests of Century and our stockholders for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Attracts and retains talent.  Talented, motivated and effective employees,                non-employee directors and consultants are essential to executing our business strategies.  Stock-based and annual cash incentive compensation has been an important component of total compensation for our executive officers and key employees                for many years because such compensation enables us to effectively recruit and retain qualified individuals while encouraging them to think and act like owners of Century.  If our stockholders approve the amended 2017 plan, we believe we will                maintain our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to both attract new talent and retain our best performers.  
[END TABLE]
Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy to increase stockholder                  value.  We believe that stock-based compensation, by its very nature, is performance-based compensation.  Over time, the most significant component of total compensation for our executives is incentive compensation in the form of                both stock-based and cash-based incentives that are tied to the achievement of business results.  We use incentive compensation both to reinforce desired business results for our key employees and to motivate them to achieve those results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Aligns director, employee and stockholder interests.  We currently provide                long-term incentives primarily in the form of restricted stock unit awards to our non-employee directors, executives and certain key employees and annual cash incentives to our executives and certain key employees.  We believe our stock-based                compensation programs, along with our stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executives, and our annual cash incentive programs for employees, help align the interests of our non-employee directors and employees with                those of our stockholders.  We believe our long-term stock-based incentives help promote long-term retention of our employees and encourage significant ownership of our common stock.  We believe our annual cash incentives reinforce                achievement of our business performance goals by linking a significant portion of participants' compensation to the achievement of these performance goals.  If the amended 2017 plan is approved, we will be able to maintain these important                means of aligning the interests of our non-employee directors and employees with those of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Protects stockholder interests and embraces sound equity-based compensation practices.                         As described in more detail below under the heading "—Summary of Sound Governance Features of the Amended 2017 Plan," the amended 2017 plan                includes a number of features that are consistent with protecting the interests of our stockholders and sound corporate governance practices.  
[END TABLE]
The Board and Compensation Committee believe that the amended 2017 plan contains several features that are consistent with protecting the interests     of our stockholders and sound corporate governance practices, including the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓   No evergreen provision   ✓   No liberal share counting  
 ✓   Not excessively dilutive   ✓   No discounted or reload stock options or SARs  
 ✓   Minimum vesting and performance period requirements   ✓   No liberal change in control definition  
 ✓   Holding period requirements   ✓   "Double-trigger" acceleration of vesting upon a change in control  
 ✓   No dividend payments on unvested awards   ✓   No tax gross-ups  
 ✓   No re-pricing of "underwater" stock options or SARs, without stockholder approval   ✓   Robust clawback policy covering cash and equity incentive compensation paid to current and former executives  
 ✓   Limits on non-employee director awards

Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement BACKGROUND FOR SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE 
If the amended 2017 plan is approved, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the amended 2017 plan will be equal     to the sum of 2,481,000 shares, plus (i) 575,984 shares of our common stock that were available for issuance under the Century Communities, Inc. First Amended & Restated 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (referred to as our "2013 plan") as of the date     of stockholder approval of the 2017 plan, but not subject to outstanding awards and (ii) up to 690,182 shares that were subject to awards outstanding under the 2013 plan as of the date of stockholder approval of the 2017 plan that are subsequently     forfeited or cancelled or expire or otherwise terminate without the issuance of such shares.  As of March 14, 2019, 959,381 shares of our common stock were subject to outstanding awards under the 2017 plan, assuming target performance under our PSU     awards, 395,361 shares of our common stock remained available for issuance under the 2017 plan, assuming target performance under our PSU awards, and 45,204 shares of our common stock remained subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 plan.
In setting the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the amended 2017 plan, the Board and Compensation Committee considered a     number of factors, which are discussed further below, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Shares available under the 2017 plan and total outstanding equity-based awards and how long the shares available are expected to last;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Historical equity award granting practices, including our three-year average share usage rate (commonly referred to as "burn rate"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Potential dilution and overhang.  
[END TABLE]
Shares Available and Outstanding Equity Awards
While the use of long-term incentives, in the form of equity awards, is an important part of our compensation program, we are mindful of our     responsibility to our stockholders to exercise judgment in the granting of equity awards.  In setting the number of shares available for issuance under the amended 2017 plan, the Board and Compensation Committee also considered shares available under     the current 2017 plan and total outstanding equity awards and how long the shares available under the 2017 plan are expected to last.  To facilitate the approval of the amended 2017 plan, set forth below is certain information about our shares of     common stock that may be issued under our equity compensation plans as of March 14, 2019.
As of March 14, 2019, we had 30,297,398 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  The market value of one share of common stock on March 14,     2019, as determined by reference to the closing price as reported on the NYSE, was $23.50.
As described in more detail in the table below, as of March 14, 2019:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 395,361 shares remained available for issuance under the 2017 plan, assuming target performance under our PSU awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· No stock options and 1,004,585 shares underlying full value awards (such as restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards) were outstanding under the 2017 plan and                our prior 2013 plan.  
[END TABLE]
Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Historical Equity Award Granting Practices
In setting the number of shares authorized for issuance under the amended 2017 plan, the Board and Compensation Committee also considered the     historical number of equity awards granted under the 2017 plan and 2013 plan in the past three full fiscal years.  The following table sets forth information regarding awards granted and earned, and the annual burn rate for each of the last three     fiscal years.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018     2017     2016  
 Stock options granted   0     0     0  
 Restricted stock awarded   0     0     0  
 Restricted stock units awarded   335,063     459,873     514,200  
 Performance share units awarded, assuming target performance   107,463     0     0  
 Weighted average basic common shares outstanding during fiscal year   30,084,913     24,280,871     20,679,189  
 Burn rate   1.47%     1.89%     2.49%  
[END TABLE]
The Board and Compensation Committee also considered our three-year average burn rate (2016 to 2018) of approximately 1.95%, which is lower than the     industry thresholds established by certain major proxy advisory firms.  Based on historical granting practices and the recent trading price of our common stock, we expect the amended 2017 plan to cover awards for approximately three years.  However, we     cannot predict our future equity grant practices, the future price of our shares or future hiring activity with any degree of certainty at this time, and the share reserve under the amended 2017 plan could last for a shorter or longer time.
Potential Dilution and Overhang
In setting the number of shares authorized for issuance under the amended 2017 plan, the Board and Compensation Committee also considered the     potential dilution and overhang that would result by approval of the amended 2017 plan, including the policies of certain institutional investors and major proxy advisory firms.
Potential dilution is calculated as shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Potential dilution   =  Total outstanding award shares divided by total number of  outstanding shares + total outstanding award shares
 Potential dilution   =  Total outstanding award shares divided by total number of  outstanding shares + total outstanding award shares
[END TABLE]
Potential overhang is calculated as shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Potential overhang                     =  Total potential award shares divided by total number of  outstanding shares + total outstanding award shares
 Potential overhang                     =  Total potential award shares divided by total number of  outstanding shares + total outstanding award shares
[END TABLE]
As of March 14, 2019, potential dilution was 3.2% and potential overhang was 4.5%.  If the amended 2017 plan is approved, potential dilution will be     3.2% and potential overhang will be 9.7%.
Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement SUMMARY OF THE AMENDED 2017 PLAN FEATURES

 Delegation  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Compensation Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more officers of Century such administrative duties or powers, as it may deem advisable, including the grant of certain awards to employees, other than Section 16 officers, non-employee directors, or 10% stockholders of Century.

 No-Repricing  The Compensation Committee may not, except as described below under "—Adjustments,"
               without prior approval of our stockholders, seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously granted "underwater" option or SAR by: (i) amending or modifying the terms of the option or SAR to lower the exercise price or grant price; (ii)

 Minimum Vesting Requirements  The amended 2017 plan provides that no awards will vest earlier than one year from the grant date and any awards that vest upon the attainment of performance goals will have a minimum performance period of one year.   There is an exception with respect to shares of common stock that do not exceed 5% of the total number of shares of common stock authorized for awards under the amended 2017 plan. There is also an exception for shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash awards and awards to non-employee directors that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting.

In addition, the Committee may in its discretion impose a more restrictive holding period on an award in an individual award agreement similar to the one-year mandatory holding period that commences after the vesting of certain PSU awards granted to executives in April 2018, which one-year mandatory holding period supersedes and replaces the holding period provided in the plan.  This holding period lapses only upon a termination due to death or disability or in connection with a change in control.

 Eligible Participants  Awards may be granted to employees, non-employee directors and consultants of Century or any of its subsidiaries.  A "consultant" is one who renders services that are not in connection with the offer and sale of our securities in a capital raising transaction and do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for our securities.  As of March 14, 2019, 1,334 employees, three non-employee directors and approximately 200 independent consultants would have been eligible to participate in the amended 2017 plan had it been approved by our stockholders at such time.

 Stock Options  Stock options entitle the holder to purchase a specified number of shares of our common stock at a specified price, which is called the exercise price, subject to the terms and conditions of the stock option grant.  The amended 2017 plan permits the grant of both non-statutory and incentive stock options.  Incentive stock options may be granted solely to eligible employees of Century or its subsidiary.  Each stock option granted under the amended 2017 plan must be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the exercise price, the term, the number of shares underlying the stock option, the vesting and any other conditions. 
               The exercise price of each stock option granted under the amended 2017 plan must be at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock as of the date the award is granted to a participant. Fair market value is the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE.  The closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, on March 14, 2019, was $23.50 per share.  The Compensation Committee will fix the terms and conditions of each stock option, subject to certain restrictions, such as a ten-year maximum term.

The Compensation Committee will fix the terms and conditions of each stock option, subject to certain restrictions, such as a ten-year maximum term.  
 Stock Appreciation Rights  A stock appreciation right, or SAR, is a right granted to receive payment of cash, stock or a combination of both, equal to the difference between the fair market value of shares of our common stock and the grant price of such shares.  Each SAR granted must be evidenced by an award agreement that specifies the grant price, the term, and such other provisions as the Compensation Committee may determine.  The grant price of a SAR must be at least 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.  The Compensation Committee will fix the term of each SAR, but SARs granted under the amended 2017 plan will not be exercisable more than 10 years after the date the SAR is granted.  
 Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units  Restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and/or deferred stock units may be granted under the amended 2017 plan.  A restricted stock award is an award of common stock that is subject to restrictions on transfer and risk of forfeiture upon certain events, typically including termination of service.  RSUs or deferred stock units are similar to restricted stock awards except that no shares are actually awarded to the participant on the grant date.  Deferred stock units permit the holder to receive shares of common stock or the equivalent value in cash or other property at a future time as determined by the Compensation
               Committee.  The Compensation Committee will determine, and set forth in an award agreement, the period of restriction, the number of shares of restricted stock awards or the number of RSUs or deferred stock units granted, the time of payment for deferred stock units and other such conditions or restrictions.

 Performance Awards  Performance awards, in the form of cash, shares of common stock, other awards or a combination of both, may be granted under the amended 2017 plan in such amounts and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine.  The Compensation Committee shall determine, and set forth in an award agreement, the amount of cash and/or number of shares or other awards, the performance goals, the performance periods and other terms and conditions.  The extent to which the participant achieves his or her performance goals during the applicable performance period will determine the amount of cash and/or number of shares or other awards earned by the participant.  At any time during a performance period of more than one fiscal year, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, cancel a portion of, or scale back, unvested performance awards under certain circumstances set forth in the amended 2017 plan, including that the performance goals for the performance period cannot be achieved at the maximum levels established at the time of grant.

 Annual Performance Cash Awards  Annual performance cash awards may be granted under the amended 2017 plan in such amounts and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine, based on the achievement of specified performance goals for annual periods or other time periods as determined by the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee will determine the target amount that may be paid with respect to an annual performance award, which will be based on a percentage of a participant's actual annual base compensation at the time of grant.  The Compensation Committee may establish a maximum potential payout amount with respect to an annual performance award in the event performance goals are exceeded by an amount established by the Compensation Committee at the time performance goals are established.  The Compensation Committee may establish measurements for prorating the amount of payouts for achievement of performance goals at less than or greater than the target payout but less than the maximum payout.

 Non-Employee Director Awards  The Compensation Committee at any time and from time to time may approve resolutions providing for the automatic grant to non-employee directors of non-statutory stock options, SARs or full value awards.  The Compensation Committee may also at any time and from time to time grant on a discretionary basis to non-employee directors non-statutory stock options, SARs or full value awards. 
               In either case, any such awards may be granted singly, in combination, or in tandem, and may be granted pursuant to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Compensation Committee may establish in its sole discretion consistent with the provisions of the amended 2017 plan.  The Compensation Committee may permit non-employee directors to elect to receive all or any portion of their annual retainers, meeting fees or other fees in restricted stock, RSUs, deferred stock units or other stock-based awards in lieu of cash.  Any awards granted to non-employee directors under the amended 2017 plan must be made by a committee consisting solely of directors who are "independent directors" under the NYSE rules and will not be subject to management's discretion.  
 Other Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards  Consistent with the terms of the 2017 plan, other cash-based awards that are not annual performance cash awards and other stock-based awards may be granted to participants in such amounts and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine.

 Performance Measures  The performance goals selected by the Compensation Committee may be based on any one or more performance measures, including those listed in the amended 2017
               plan. Any of the performance measures can be used in an algebraic formula (e.g., averaged over a period), combined into a ratio, compared to a budget or standard, compared to previous periods or other formulaic combinations. Any of the performance measures specified in the amended 2017 plan may be used to measure the performance of Century or any subsidiary, as a whole, or any division or business unit, product or product group, region or territory, or any combination thereof, as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.  Performance measures may be compared to the performance of a peer group or a published or special index that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate or, with respect to share price, various stock market indices.  The Compensation Committee also may provide for accelerated vesting of any award based on the achievement of performance goals.   The Compensation Committee may amend or modify the vesting criteria (including any performance goals, performance measures or performance periods) of any outstanding awards based in whole or in part on the financial performance of Century (or any subsidiary or division, business unit or other sub-unit thereof) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting Century or the financial statements of Century or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, whenever the Compensation Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the amended 2017 plan.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION 
The following is a general summary, as of the date of this proxy statement, of the federal income tax consequences to participants and Century of     transactions under the amended 2017 plan.  This summary is intended for the information of stockholders considering how to vote at the annual meeting and not as tax guidance to participants in the amended 2017 plan, as the consequences may vary with     the types of grants made, the identity of the participant and the method of payment or settlement.  This summary does not address the effects of other federal taxes or taxes imposed under state, local or foreign tax laws.  Participants are encouraged     to seek the advice of a qualified tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of participation in the amended 2017 plan.
Incentive Stock Options.  With respect to incentive     stock options, generally, the stock option holder is not taxed, and we are not entitled to a deduction, on either the grant or the exercise of an incentive stock option so long as the requirements of Section 422 of the Code continue to be met.  If the     stock option holder meets the employment requirements and does not dispose of the shares of our common stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option until at least one year after date of the exercise of the stock option and at least two     years after the date the stock option was granted, gain or loss realized on sale of the shares will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss.  If the shares of our common stock are disposed of before those periods expire, which is called a     disqualifying disposition, the stock option holder will be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price,     or (ii) if the disposition is a taxable sale or exchange, the amount of gain realized.  Upon a disqualifying disposition, we will generally be entitled, in the same tax year, to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the stock     option holder, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Non-Statutory Stock Options.  The grant of a stock     option that does not qualify for treatment as an incentive stock option, which is generally referred to as a non-statutory stock option, is generally not a taxable event for the stock option holder.  Upon exercise of the stock option, the stock option     holder will generally be required to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock acquired upon exercise (determined as of the date of exercise) over the exercise price of the stock option, and     we will be entitled to a deduction in an equal amount in the same tax year, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.  At the time of a subsequent sale or disposition of shares obtained upon exercise of a non-statutory     stock option, any gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss, which will be either a long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
SARs.  The grant of an SAR will not cause the     participant to recognize ordinary income or entitle us to a deduction for federal income tax purposes.  Upon the exercise of an SAR, the participant will recognize ordinary income in the amount of the cash or the value of shares payable to the     participant (before reduction for any withholding taxes), and we will receive a corresponding deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Restricted Stock, RSUs, Deferred Stock Units and Other       Stock-Based Awards.  The federal income tax consequences with respect to restricted stock, RSUs, deferred stock units, performance shares and performance stock units, and other stock unit and stock-based awards depend on the facts and     circumstances of each award, including, in particular, the nature of any restrictions imposed with respect to the awards.  In general, if an award of stock granted to the participant is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" (e.g., the award is conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services by the participant) and is nontransferable, a taxable event occurs when the     risk of forfeiture ceases or the awards become transferable, whichever first occurs.  At such time, the participant will recognize ordinary income to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the stock on such date over the participant's     cost for such stock (if any), and the same amount is deductible by us, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Under certain circumstances, the participant, by making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, can     accelerate federal income tax recognition with respect to an award of stock that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability restrictions, in which event the ordinary income amount and our deduction will be measured and timed as     of the grant date of the award.  If the stock award granted to the participant is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or transferability restrictions, the participant will recognize ordinary income with respect to the award to the extent of     the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant over the participant's cost, if any, and the same amount is deductible by us, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.  If a stock unit award or other     stock-based award is granted but no stock is actually issued to the participant at the time the award is granted, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time the participant receives the stock free of any substantial risk of forfeiture     (or receives cash in lieu of such stock) and the amount of such income will be equal to the fair market value of the stock at such time over the participant's cost, if any, and the same amount is then deductible by us, assuming that a deduction is     allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Annual Performance Cash Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards.          Annual performance cash awards and other cash-based awards will be taxable as ordinary income to the participant in the amount of the cash received by the participant (before reduction for any withholding taxes), and we will receive a corresponding     deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, assuming that a deduction is allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Withholding Obligations.  We are entitled to withhold     and deduct from future wages of the participant, to make other arrangements for the collection of, or to require the recipient to pay to us, an amount necessary for us to satisfy the recipient's federal, state or local tax withholding obligations with     respect to awards granted under the 2017 plan.  Withholding for taxes may be calculated based on the maximum applicable tax rate for the participant's jurisdiction or such other rate that will not trigger a negative accounting impact on Century.  The     Compensation Committee may permit a participant to satisfy a tax withholding obligation by withholding shares of common stock underlying an award, tendering previously acquired shares, delivery of a broker exercise notice or a combination of these     methods.
Century           Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Code Section 409A.  A grant may be subject to a 20%     penalty tax, in addition to ordinary income tax, at the time the grant becomes vested, plus an interest penalty tax, if the grant constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code are not     satisfied.
Code Section 162(m).  Pursuant to Section 162(m) of     the Code, the annual compensation paid to an individual who is a "covered employee" is not deductible to the extent it exceeds $1 million.  The Tax Cut and Jobs Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the Tax Act), amended Section 162(m), effective     for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, (i) to expand the definition of a "covered employee" to include any person who was the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer at any time during the year and the three most highly     compensated officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer) who were employed at any time during the year whether or not the compensation is reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in our proxy statement for     our Annual Meeting of Stockholders; (ii) to treat any individual who is considered a covered employee at any time during a tax year beginning after December 31, 2106, as remaining a covered employee permanently; and (iii) to eliminate the     performance-based compensation exception to the $1 million deduction limit (with a transition provision continuing the performance-based exception for certain compensation covered by a written binding contract in existence on November 2, 2017).
Excise Tax on Parachute Payments.  Unless otherwise     provided in a separate agreement between a participant and Century, if, with respect to a participant, the acceleration of the vesting of an award or the payment of cash in exchange for all or part of an award, together with any other payments that     such participant has the right to receive from Century, would constitute a "parachute payment" then the payments to such participant will be reduced to the largest amount as will result in no portion of such payments being subject to the excise tax     imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.  Such reduction, however, will only be made if the aggregate amount of the payments after such reduction exceeds the difference between the amount of such payments absent such reduction minus the aggregate amount of     the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code attributable to any such excess parachute payments.  If such provisions are applicable and if an employee will be subject to a 20% excise tax on any "excess parachute payment" pursuant to Section     4999 of the Code, we will be denied a deduction with respect to such excess parachute payment pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.
NEW PLAN BENEFITS 
It is not presently possible to determine the benefits or amounts that will be received by or allocated to participants under the amended 2017 plan     or would have been received by or allocated to participants for the last completed fiscal year if the amended 2017 plan had then been in effect because awards under the amended 2017 plan will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.      Further, since any automatic awards to our non-employee directors will depend on the non-employee directors' continued service and the Board's discretion to vary the type and terms of those awards in the future, it is not possible to determine the     exact number of shares of our common stock that will be subject to such awards.  However, under the policy currently in effect, each person serving as a non-employee director on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders will receive RSUs valued     at $120,000.

PROPOSAL NO. 3:RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OFINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
APPOINTMENT
The Audit Committee appoints our independent registered public accounting firm, or independent auditor. In this regard, the Audit Committee       evaluates the qualifications, performance, and independence of our independent auditor and determines whether to re-engage the current auditor.  As part of its evaluation, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, the quality and efficiency       of the services provided by the independent auditor, including the performance, technical expertise, and industry knowledge of the lead audit partner and the audit team assigned to our account; the overall strength and reputation of the audit firm;       the auditor's national capabilities relative to our business; the auditor's knowledge of our operations; and the auditor's fees.  Upon consideration of these and other factors, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) to       serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
Stockholder ratification of the selection of E&Y as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or       otherwise.  However, the Board is submitting the appointment of E&Y to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of corporate practice.  If our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to       retain E&Y.  Even if the selection is ratified by our stockholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee       determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Century and our stockholders.
A representative of E&Y is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so       desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX, AND OTHER FEES

Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
PROPOSAL NO. 4:ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
BACKGROUND          
The Board is providing our stockholders with an advisory vote on our executive compensation pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer       Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and Section 14A of the Exchange Act.  This advisory vote, commonly known as a say-on-pay vote, is a non-binding vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers as set forth in this proxy statement.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders had the opportunity to vote on an advisory say-on-pay proposal and a say-on-frequency       proposal. Over 92% of the votes cast were in favor of our say-on-pay proposal and our stockholders voted overwhelmingly in favor of an annual say-on-pay vote.
In designing the compensation program for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the results of the 2018 say-on-pay vote, our ongoing dialogue       with stockholders, internal considerations such as consistency from year to year, and an evaluation of peer practices. After consideration, the Compensation Committee concluded that, for 2018, it was appropriate to maintain the existing compensation       mix for our executives. Our 2018 compensation program continued to tie the majority of our executives' compensation to performance metrics that support the Company's growth strategy.
WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF OUR SAY-ON-PAY VOTE          
Our executive compensation program is generally designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward highly qualified and talented executive officers       that will enable us to drive long-term stockholder value.  The underlying core principles of our executive compensation program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders and linking pay to performance by providing compensation opportunities that are tied directly to the                  achievement of financial performance goals and long-term stock price performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· targeting fixed compensation between the market 25th percentile and the market median; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· targeting performance-based award levels between the 25th percentile and the market median                  and setting maximum award levels at or above the market 75th percentile, thereby emphasizing performance-based compensation elements, with superior performance                  resulting in above-market pay, and underwhelming performance resulting in below-market pay.  
[END TABLE]
We believe this balance allows us to attract and retain the necessary executive talent while motivating and rewarding the accomplishment of annual       and long-term financial performance goals and maintaining an appropriate cost structure.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Our compensation practices include many best pay practices that support our executive compensation objectives and principles and benefit our       stockholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Do   What We Don't Do  
 ✓   Structure our executive officer compensation so that a significant portion of pay is at risk      No guaranteed salary increases or bonuses  
 ✓   Emphasize long-term performance in our equity-based incentive awards      No excessive perquisites  
 ✓   Use a mix of performance measures and caps on payouts      No repricing of stock options unless approved by stockholders  
 ✓   Require minimum vesting periods on equity awards      No discretionary bonuses  
 ✓   Require double-trigger for equity acceleration upon a change of control      No tax gross-ups  
 ✓   Maintain a competitive compensation package      No excise tax gross-ups  
 ✓   Have robust stock ownership guidelines and stock retention requirements for executive officers      No current payment of dividends on unvested awards  
 ✓   Maintain a robust clawback policy covering cash and equity incentive compensation paid to current and former executives      No short sales or derivative transactions in Century stock, including hedges

[END TABLE]
We encourage our stockholders to read the "Compensation         Discussion and Analysis," beginning on page 49, which describes in detail our executive compensation program and the executive compensation decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2018, as well as the accompanying executive       compensation tables and narratives that provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers.
We believe that our executive compensation program is competitive, focused on pay for performance, and strongly aligned with the long-term       interests of our stockholders.  The Compensation Committee believes that executive compensation for 2018 was reasonable, appropriate, and justified by the performance of the Company and the result of a carefully considered approach.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION          
The Board recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the say-on-pay vote as set forth in the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that our stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the       compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the accompanying compensation tables and the       corresponding narrative discussion and footnotes, and any related material disclosed in this proxy statement.
Stockholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the Board's recommendation.  As this is an advisory vote, the outcome of the vote is not       binding on us with respect to future executive compensation decisions, including those relating to our named executive officers, or otherwise.  The Compensation Committee and Board expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering       future executive compensation decisions.

NEXT SAY-ON-PAY VOTE          
Consistent with the results from last year's advisory vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote, the Board determined that we will conduct a       say-on-pay vote on an annual basis. Accordingly, the next say-on-pay vote will occur at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION          
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation, or say-on-pay vote.

Because the structure of our programs changed, the grant of these awards was deemed to occur in 2018 (not at the earlier time when the performance metric was set), which resulted in a substantial increase in reported equity-based compensation for our NEOs in 2018 compared to 2017, even though the NEOs'

Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY          
Given the small size of Century's executive team, each executive has assumed responsibilities beyond what is generally found for similar executives       in comparable companies.  Many of these additional responsibilities directly impact the growth of Century.  Further, Century emphasizes performance-based compensation elements, with superior performance resulting in above-market pay, and       underwhelming performance resulting in below-market pay.
As such, the Compensation Committee has determined that fixed compensation (i.e., base salary) should be targeted at the market median, with performance-based incentive compensation opportunities resulting in total direct compensation that ranges from well below the market median to the top       quartile of the market (based on performance).  The Compensation Committee has determined that target award levels will align total direct compensation at the market median, and maximum award levels, if earned, will align total direct compensation at       or above the market 75th percentile.
COMPETITIVE CONSIDERATIONS AND USE OF MARKET DATA          
We strive to compensate our executive officers competitively relative to industry peers.  To ensure reasonableness and competitiveness of our       executive compensation packages relative to the industry, the Compensation Committee regularly evaluates our peer group with the aid of our independent external compensation consultant and with input from management.  Data from our peer group,       therefore, is considered in the compensation benchmarking process as one input in helping to determine appropriate pay levels.
In establishing compatibility between Century and the members of our peer group, the following three factors are considered:

All of these companies are public companies in the homebuilding industry whose business model involves development, design, construction of homes       and/or development of land and that have annual revenues and a market capitalization generally within a range of our annual revenues and market capitalization.  We rank at the 42nd percentile of our peer group for revenue, 47th percentile for projected 2019 revenue and 31st percentile for market capitalization.  In constructing this peer group, the Compensation Committee also considered whether companies disclosed Century as a peer, companies that appear in the peer groups of our peer       companies and companies of which Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) considers a peer of ours in its latest voting recommendations report.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement SAY-ON-PAY VOTE          
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders had the opportunity to vote on an advisory say-on-pay proposal and a say-on-frequency       proposal. Over 92% of the votes cast were in favor of our say-on-pay proposal and our stockholders were overwhelmingly in favor of an annual say-on-pay vote.
In designing the compensation program for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the results of the 2018 say-on-pay vote, our ongoing dialogue       with stockholders and investors, internal considerations such as consistency from year to year and an evaluation of peer practices.  After consideration, the Compensation Committee concluded that, for 2018, it was appropriate to maintain the existing       compensation mix for our NEOs.  Our 2018 compensation program continued to tie the majority of our NEOs' compensation to performance metrics that support the Company's growth strategy.
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT          
While the Board is encouraged by the results of our 2018 say-on-pay vote where the vast majority of our stockholders supported our compensation       program design, the Board nonetheless continued to seek stockholder feedback throughout 2018.  Over the course of the year, our executives held more than 200 meetings with stockholders representing over 70 percent of shares outstanding, in total,       including all of our top 10 shareholders that are actively managed funds.  Members of management participated in each meeting.  One of the objectives of these engagement sessions was to solicit feedback on aspects of our executive compensation       program.  Stockholder feedback was relayed directly to the Compensation Committee and full Board, which considered that feedback while evaluating opportunities to further enhance our executive compensation programs.
ELEMENTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM          
During 2018, our executive compensation program consisted of several key elements as described in the table below, as well as key characteristics       of, and purpose for, each element.  The following table also describes any key 2018 changes to each of these elements.

The RSU awards vest in three equal annual installments.   The use of PSU awards led to a change in the accounting for our LTI program in 2018, resulting in a substantial increase in reported equity-based compensation for our NEOs in 2018 compared to 2017, even though the NEOs' actual year-over-year compensation did not materially increase. Due to the accounting change, our reported numbers in 2018 reflect grants for two years, and payouts in RSUs related to 2016 LTI grants.

We describe each key element of our executive compensation program in more detail in the following pages, along with the compensation decisions       made in 2018.  The compensation paid to our NEOs is governed, in part, by written employment agreements with them, which are described below under "Executive         Compensation—Employment and Other Agreements."
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AND PAY MIX
We seek to motivate management to achieve improved financial performance of our Company through incentive plans that reward higher performance with       increased incentive payouts and hold management accountable for financial performance that falls below targeted levels by paying reduced or no incentive payouts.  Accordingly, in general, our executive compensation program emphasizes variable,       at-risk, pay elements as a significant portion of each NEO's total compensation package.
The breakdown of variable, at-risk, pay (broken out between target annual short-term incentives and long-term incentives) compared to fixed pay (i.e., base salary) reported for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table for our Co-CEOs and CFO is as follows:
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION          
Base Salary
Purpose:  Base salary is designed to compensate our       NEOs at a fixed level of compensation that provides some financial certainty and security for our NEOs, and also serves as a retention tool throughout the executive's career.
Competitive Positioning:  In setting base salaries,       the Compensation Committee considers many factors, including each executive's roles and responsibilities, unique skills, future potential with Century, salary levels for similar positions in our market and internal pay equity.  While a Co-CEO       executive structure is not commonly found in the marketplace, we believe our leadership structure is appropriate in light of our historical growth and expected future development.  Further, the small number of executive officers at Century and the       absence of other leadership positions within Century's executive team, such as a Chief Operating Officer, that are otherwise generally found on the leadership teams of other companies, requires our executives to perform multiple roles and take on       additional responsibilities that would otherwise not be required of CEOs and CFOs.  As such, when determining compensation amounts for the year, the Compensation Committee takes into account these factors and the fact that Century has two Co-CEOs who       each perform a broad range of duties which would generally be spread over a number of executive positions as described above.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Our goal is to target the market median as our strategic target for base salary.  We review each executive's base salary and performance every year       to determine whether base salary should be adjusted.  Along with individual performance, we also consider movement of salary in the market, as well as our financial results from the prior year to determine appropriate salary adjustments.  Under their       employment agreements, the base salaries of our Co-CEOs may not be adjusted downward.
While the Compensation Committee applies general compensation concepts when determining the competitiveness of our executives' salaries, the       Compensation Committee generally considers base salaries as being competitive when they are within approximately 10% of the stated market target.
2018 Review:  The Compensation Committee       reevaluated NEO compensation relative to the market data in early 2018 and determined to maintain the base salaries of our Co-CEOs, but increase the base salary of our CFO to bring his salary closer to the market median.  The CFOs salary increase was       effective in April 2018.

Short-Term Incentive – Annual Cash Bonus
Purpose:  Our short-term incentive, or annual cash       bonus program, is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual financial and operational objectives.  Annual cash bonuses are designed to incentivize our NEOs at a variable level of compensation based on Century's performance, as well as, in       the case of our CFO, individual performance.
Competitive Positioning:  Our strategy is to target       between the market 25th percentile and market median for short-term incentives for performance that meets expected levels and to target total cash compensation (base       salary plus target STI) between the market 25th percentile and market median.  We have established a range of possible payouts under the plan so that our competitive       position could be above or below our stated strategy based on performance outcomes.
2018 STI Awards: For 2018, the threshold, target       and maximum STI opportunities for our NEOs were as follows:

[END TABLE]
In considering the performance metrics that should apply in calculating our Co-CEOs' STI awards, the Compensation Committee determined that the       performance metrics should be based on overall Company performance as opposed to individual performance.  The Compensation Committee furthermore determined that the most important measures of Company success, which should form the basis of our       Co-CEOs' STI awards, were revenue, EBITDA, as adjusted, and number of closings.  In considering the performance metrics that should apply in calculating our CFO's STI award, the Compensation Committee determined that his STI award should be based, in       part, on the same Company performance metrics as our Co-CEOs to align the entire executive team, as well as individual performance goals. In 2017, our CFO's performance metrics were revenue and individual performance goals.
The Company financial performance metrics, and the performance levels attached to each, as well as actual performance, are reflected in the       following table.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  This is a non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA, as adjusted is calculated by excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization from net income and                  also excluding incremental EBITDA as a result of the Wade Jurney Homes acquisition, transaction expenses and executive bonuses for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
In determining the threshold, target and maximum goals for each performance metric, the Compensation Committee set the target for each metric using       Century's projected business plan for 2018 (i.e., as the amount in the target business plan approved by the Board).  Threshold was set at 90% of target,       and maximum was set at 110% of target. If the threshold level was not achieved with respect to a given performance metric, then no payout was made with respect to that metric.
For 2018, our NEOs earned cash bonuses based on maximum performance for adjusted EBITDA and closings and revenue between target and maximum       performance, and our CFO earned a cash bonus based on these same corporate metrics as well as individual goals, which were between target and maximum performance.  This resulted in an STI award payout for each of our NEOs between the target and       maximum payouts.

Long-Term Incentives – 2018 Program
Purpose:  Our long-term incentive program is       designed to reward NEOs for the achievement of specific financial objectives, recognize their efforts on our behalf, and provide an additional incentive and retention element to their overall compensation package.  Our LTI program is also intended to       align the interests of our executives with our stockholders.
Competitive Positioning:  We target between the       market median with our target LTI program and at or above market 75th percentile for above-target performance.
LTI Awards and Plan Mechanics:  The target LTI       award opportunity for each of our Co-CEOs was 250% of base salary and approximately 220% of base salary for our CFO for 2018.  Our LTI program for 2018 consisted of a mix of PSU and RSU awards. The PSU and RSU awards were granted under the Century       Communities, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan and represent the right to receive Century common stock upon vesting.  The PSU awards will vest and be paid out in shares of our common stock upon the achievement of cumulative adjusted pre-tax income       goals over three years and the RSU awards will vest and be paid out in shares of our common stock in three equal annual installments.  Once paid out, the shares underlying the PSU awards will be subject to a mandatory one-year holding period.
2018 LTI Award Opportunity:  For the 2018 LTI       awards, the Compensation Committee first determined a target LTI value for each executive based on a percentage of base salary and then delivered 60% of this value in PSU awards and 40% in time-based RSU awards.

Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
Long-Term Incentives – Payouts from 2016 Grants
Background:  As described above, under our 2018 LTI       program, our NEOs received a mix of PSU awards and time-vested RSU awards.  The use of PSU awards led to a change in the accounting for our LTI program, resulting in a substantial increase in reported equity-based compensation for our NEOs in 2018       compared to 2017, even though the NEOs' actual year-over-year compensation did not materially increase.  As a result of the accounting treatment for the PSU and time-vested RSU awards, the entire grant date fair values of these awards are included in       the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table, amounting to approximately $2.1 million for each of our Co-CEOs and $1.2 million for our CFO. Under our prior accounting treatment, the PSU awards would have been reported in a future year.       Each of our NEOs also received an RSU award in February 2018 as a payout from our 2016 LTI program based primarily on the achievement of a previously established adjusted multi-year pre-tax income performance goal for the two years ended December 31,       2017.  Under the accounting rules, the payout of the 2016 LTI grant in RSU awards was deemed to occur in 2018 (not at the earlier time when the performance metric was set), which resulted in an additional $2.0 million in grant date fair value       included in the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table for each of our Co-CEOs and $800,000 for our CFO. Due to this transition in how we account for our LTI program, the reported equity compensation component of our NEOs' total       compensation increased substantially in 2018 compared to prior years, even though the NEOs' year-over-year actual compensation did not materially increase.  Because of the three-year performance period of our prior LTI program, the grant of       time-based RSU awards in February as payouts of prior LTI programs will continue through 2020, resulting in inflated equity compensation numbers each year through 2020, with normalization occurring in 2021.
2018 LTI Award as Payout from 2016 LTI Award.  As       part of our prior LTI program, in February 2018, the Compensation Committee granted RSU awards as payouts under our prior LTI program. For the these RSU awards, the Compensation Committee had established the following threshold, target, maximum and       maximum with kicker LTI award opportunities for our Co-CEOs and CFO:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 David L. Messenger   50% of target   66.6% of base salary   200% of target   250% of target  
[END TABLE]
The performance-based metric used for the February 2018 RSU award grants was adjusted pre-tax income.  However, as part of our plan to transition       to three-year performance periods, the performance period was over two years and was cumulative adjusted pre-tax income for the two years ended December 31, 2017.  In February 2018, the Compensation Committee granted RSU awards to our NEOs based on       our achieved two-year cumulative adjusted pre-tax income for 2016 and 2017 in comparison to the following pre-established performance levels:

Long-Term Incentives – Supplemental Adjusted Summary Compensation Table
As previously discussed, due to the transition in how we account for our LTI program, the reported equity compensation component of our NEOs' total       compensation increased substantially in 2018 compared to prior years, even though the NEOs' year-over-year actual compensation did not materially increase.  The following is summary compensation information for our NEOs, assuming the grant date fair       values of their February 2018 RSU award payouts under our prior LTI program were not included in the "Stock Awards" column. Given this adjustment, the information presented in the table below does not meet SEC requirements for the Summary       Compensation Table. This information is supplemental to, and not a substitute for, the compensation information reported in the Summary Compensation Table.  Stockholders are advised to read this Adjusted Summary Compensation Table in conjunction with       the Summary Compensation Table, beginning on page 66 of this proxy statement.

Other Benefits
In 2018, our NEOs had the opportunity to participate in a qualified defined contribution retirement plan on the same basis as our other employees.        We believe this plan provides an opportunity for our executives to plan for and meet their retirement savings needs.  We do not provide any pension arrangements, nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plans.
We provide our NEOs with modest perquisites to attract and retain them and to allow them to more efficiently utilize their time and to support them       in effectively contributing to the success of our Company.  The perquisites provided to our NEOs during 2018 included an automobile and cellular telephone allowance and, in the case of our Co-CEOs, reimbursements for term life insurance.  When it is       not being used for Company purposes, the NEOs may use the corporate aircraft for non-Company purposes.  In the event of such use, the NEOs are required to reimburse the Company at a lease rate equal to the aggregate incremental per hour cost of each       flight pursuant to the terms of their aircraft time sharing agreements.  We believe these benefits are an important part of our overall compensation program and help us accomplish our goal of attracting, retaining, and rewarding top executive talent.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS, SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS, AND POST-TERMINATION RESTRICTIONS          
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our NEOs.  These employment agreements are described under "Executive Compensation —Employment and Other Agreements."  The purpose of these agreements is to define the essential terms of these executives' employment relationships in a manner       that will protect our business and other interests and the interests of the executive, including in the event his employment is terminated upon certain events. The severance provisions in the agreement are intended to induce these executives to       continue employment with our Company and to retain them and provide consideration to them for certain restrictive covenants that apply following a termination of employment.  Additionally, we entered into these agreements because they provide us       valuable protection by subjecting these executives to restrictive covenants that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information during and following their employment and limit their ability to engage in competition with us or otherwise interfere       with our business relationships following a termination of their employment. The receipt of any severance by these executives is conditioned upon his execution of a release of claims.
In October 2018, we amended and restated the employment agreements with our Co-CEOs, the primary purpose of which was to modify the definition of       "retirement" to extend by two years (to November 1, 2020) the earliest date after which the executive may terminate employment for retirement and receive certain benefits in connection therewith so as to avoid a requirement to recognize immediately       the full stock-based accounting expense associated with equity awards held by such executives.  We also made certain other changes to these agreements, including extending the term by two years by imposing a new five-year term; reflecting their       current base salaries and annual bonus opportunities and revising their cash severance provisions.
To encourage continuity, stability and retention when considering the potential disruptive impact of an actual or potential corporate transaction,       we have established change in control arrangements, including provisions in our employment agreements with our NEOs.  These provisions provide our NEOs certain payments and benefits in the event of a termination of their employment in connection with       a change in control.  These additional payments and benefits will not be triggered just by a change in control, but require a termination event not within the control of the executive, and thus are known as "double trigger" change in control       arrangements.  These "double trigger" change in control protections are intended to induce executives to accept or continue employment with our Company, provide consideration to executives for certain restrictive covenants that apply following       termination of employment, and provide continuity of management in connection with a threatened or actual change in control transaction.  If the employment of one of our NEOs is terminated by Century without cause or by him for good reason 24 months       following or in the case of our Co-CEOs, within six months preceding, a change in control, the executive will be entitled to receive a severance payment and certain benefits.  The receipt of any severance is conditioned upon the executive's execution       of a release of claims.
We believe these change in control arrangements with our NEOs are an important part of our executive compensation program in part because they       mitigate some of the risk for executives working in a smaller public company where there is a meaningful likelihood that the company may be acquired.  Change in control benefits are intended to attract and retain qualified executives who, absent       these arrangements and in anticipation of a possible change in control of our Company, might consider seeking employment alternatives to be less risky than remaining with our Company through the transaction.  We believe that relative to our Company's       overall value, our potential change in control benefits are relatively small and are aligned with current peer company practices.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
RISK ASSESSMENT          
As a result of our assessment on risk in our compensation programs, we concluded that our compensation policies, practices, and programs and       related compensation governance structure, work together in a manner so as to encourage our executives (and other employees) to pursue growth strategies that emphasize stockholder value creation, but not to take unnecessary or excessive risks that       could threaten the value of our Company.  For more information on this assessment, see the discussions under "Executive Compensation—Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies, Practices and Programs."
CLAWBACK POLICY          
In November 2018, we adopted a new robust clawback policy pursuant to which we may recover cash and equity incentive compensation from current or       former officers in the event a financial metric used to determine the vesting or payment of incentive compensation to an executive was calculated incorrectly and resulted in a financial restatement.
EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES          
We have established stock ownership guidelines that are intended to further align the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders.  A       stock ownership target for each of our NEOs has been set at that number of shares of our Century common stock with a value equal to a multiple of the NEO's annual base salary.  All of our NEOs are in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines.

Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), in designing our executive compensation program, we considered the deductibility of       executive compensation under Code Section 162(m).  The Tax Act, among other things, repealed the exemption from Code Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for "performance-based" compensation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.  Some of       our compensation plans were designed with the intention of satisfying the requirements for "performance-based" compensation as defined in Code Section 162(m) prior to the effective date of the Tax Act so that such awards would be exempt from the Code       Section 162(m) deduction limitation.  While we designed these plans to operate in this manner, the Compensation Committee may administer the plans in a manner that does not satisfy such requirements in order to achieve a result that the Compensation       Committee determines to be appropriate, including by revising performance goals and/or adjustment events as needed to ensure our pay practices continue to align with performance.  In addition, despite the Compensation Committee's efforts to structure       performance-based compensation in a manner intended to be exempt from the Code Section 162(m) deduction limit, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Code Section 162(m) in fact will.        Regardless of the changes to Section 162(m) as a result of the Tax Act, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy of linking pay to performance and aligning executive interests with those of our stockholders, we currently expect that we       will continue to structure our executive compensation program so that a significant portion of total executive compensation is linked to the performance of our Company.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement HOW WE MAKE COMPENSATION DECISIONS
There are several elements to our executive compensation decision-making, which we believe allow us to most effectively implement our compensation       philosophy.  The Compensation Committee, its independent external compensation consultant and management all have a role in decision-making for executive compensation.
The following table summarizes their roles and responsibilities:

(1)  We did not pay any discretionary bonuses or bonuses that are subjectively determined to any NEOs in any of the years presented. Annual cash bonuses, reported in the                  "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column, are based on performance, which is measured against pre-established performance goals.

(2)  Amounts reported for 2018 represent the grant date fair value of RSU and PSU awards granted to our NEOs, computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board                  (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. These are not amounts paid to or realized by the NEOs. We caution that the amounts reported in the table for stock awards and, therefore, total compensation, may not represent the                  amounts that each NEO will actually realize from the awards. Whether, and to what extent, an NEO realizes value will depend on a number of factors, including Company performance and stock price. The grant date fair value of the PSU awards                  assumes target levels of performance.  The grant date fair value of the PSU awards assuming maximum levels of performance are as follows: Mr. Dale Francescon ($3,149,982); Mr. Robert Francescon ($3,149,982) and Mr. Messenger ($1,439,994).  
[END TABLE]
Each of our NEOs also received an RSU award in February 2018 as a payout under our 2016 LTI program based primarily on the achievement of a       previously established adjusted multi-year pre-tax income performance goal for the two years ended December 31, 2017.  Under the accounting rules, the grant of the February 2018 RSU awards was deemed to occur in 2018 (not at the earlier time when the       performance metric was set), which resulted in an additional $2.0 million in grant date fair value included in the "Stock Awards" column for each of our Co-CEOs and $800,000 for our CFO.

EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS          
Co-CEO Employment Agreements
In October 2018, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with each of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dale Francescon and       Robert J. Francescon, which has an initial five-year term and provides for automatic one-year extensions thereafter. These agreements contain customary confidentiality provisions as well as non-competition and non-solicitation provisions.
These agreements provide for an initial annual base salary of $850,000; an annual cash performance bonus opportunity at threshold equal to 87.5% of       annual base salary, at target equal to 175% of annual base salary, and at maximum equal to 350% of annual base salary; participation in our equity incentive plans; reimbursement of up to $2,500 per month for term life insurance premiums; and a $2,500       per month automobile and cell phone allowance.
No severance benefits are payable if we terminate the executive's employment for cause or if he resigns voluntarily and without good reason and       other than by reason of retirement.  If we terminate the executive's employment due to his disability, or his employment terminates due to his death or retirement, he or his estate will be entitled to receive (i) a pro rata amount of his annual       incentive bonus for the fiscal year in which employment terminated calculated based on actual performance; (ii) a pro rata amount of the equity awards for the fiscal year or performance period in which employment terminated based on target       performance, unless actual performance exceeds target based on proration of the performance goals through the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the termination date; (iii) the immediate vesting of all equity awards granted to him not then       based on performance; and (iv) our payment for up to 18 months of that portion of his COBRA premiums that exceeds what he would have paid if he were an active employee.  For purposes of the agreements, "retirement" means the executive's voluntary       termination of his employment provided the executive: (a) has reached (or will reach on or after the termination date) the age of 60 along with at least 20 years of employment with us (for purposes of the agreements, each executive's employment with       us is deemed to have commenced on November 1, 2000); and (b) provides us with notice of his intent to retire at least 90 days in advance of the termination date.  If we terminate the executive's employment without cause or if he terminates his       employment for good reason, he will be entitled to (i) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to two times his annual base salary; (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the greater of either two times his average annual bonus for the three preceding       fiscal years or two times his potential target bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs; (iii) the immediate vesting of all equity awards, including grants for the year of termination based on target performance, and for other       performance-based equity awards, determined at the greater of target or actual performance achieved against a proration of the original performance goals through the last day of the calendar quarter preceding the termination date; and (iv) our       payment for up to 18 months of that portion of his COBRA premiums that exceeds the amount he would have paid as an active employee. If we terminate the executive's employment without cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason, within       six months preceding or within 24 months following a "change in control" (as defined in the agreements), in addition to the other payments described above (but in lieu of the payment in clauses (i) and (ii) above), the executive will receive a lump       sum cash severance payment equal to three times his base salary and a lump sum cash payment equal to the greater of:  (A) three times his potential target bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs; or (B) three times his average annual       bonus for the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the termination date.  To the extent that any change in control payment or benefit would be subject to the "golden parachute" excise tax under Code Section 4999, the payments will be       reduced to an amount that will not subject the executive to the excise tax if the reduction results in him receiving a greater amount on a net after tax basis than would be received if he received the payment and benefits and paid the excise tax.        The severance payments and benefits provided for above are conditioned upon our receipt of a release of claims from the executive.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
CFO Employment Agreement
In November 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with our CFO, David L. Messenger.  This agreement has an initial term of three years and       provides for automatic one-year extensions thereafter.  Mr. Messenger's agreement contains customary confidentiality provisions as well as non-competition and non-solicitation provisions.
This agreement provides for an initial annual base salary of $475,000 (which was subsequently raised to $550,000 for 2018); an annual cash       performance bonus opportunity at threshold equal to 50% of annual base salary, at target equal to 100% of annual base salary, and at maximum equal to 200% of annual base salary; participation in our equity incentive plans; and a $500 per month       automobile and cell phone allowance.
No severance benefits are payable if we terminate Mr. Messenger's employment for cause or if he resigns voluntarily and without good reason.  In       addition, any outstanding equity awards granted to him will be paid in accordance with their terms. If we terminate Mr. Messenger's employment due to his disability or if his employment terminates due to his death, he or his estate will be entitled       to receive (i) the prorated amount of the annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year his employment terminated based on actual performance for that year, provided he was employed for at least 50% of the year; (ii) the prorated amount of the equity       awards he would have received for the fiscal year his employment terminated calculated based on target performance, provided he was employed for at least 50% of the performance period; (iii) the immediate vesting of all unvested equity awards granted       to him that vest based on the passage of time; and (iv) our payment for up to 18 months of that portion of the executive's COBRA premiums that exceeds what he would have paid as an active employee.  If we terminate Mr. Messenger's employment without       cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason, he will be entitled to (i) a cash severance payment equal to his annual base salary payable as salary continuation over 12 months; (ii) the prorated amount of his annual incentive bonus for       the fiscal year his employment terminated calculated based on actual performance; (iii) the prorated amount of the equity awards for the fiscal year his employment terminated, based on target; (iv) the immediate vesting of all equity awards granted       to him that vest based on the passage of time; and (v) our payment for up to 18 months of that portion of his COBRA premiums that exceeds what he would have paid if he were an active employee.  If we terminate Mr. Messenger's employment without cause       or if he terminates his employment for good reason within 24 months following a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), in addition to the other payments described above (but in lieu of the cash severance and prorated annual bonus       payments), Mr. Messenger will receive an amount equal to two times his annual base salary plus two times the greater of his target annual bonus for the year in which termination occurs or the average of his annual bonuses paid to him for the three       completed fiscal years immediately preceding the termination date.  To the extent that any change in control payment or benefit would be subject to the "golden parachute" excise tax under Code Section 4999, the payments will be reduced to an amount       that will not subject him to the excise tax if the reduction results in him receiving a greater amount on a net after tax basis than would be received if he received the payment and benefits and paid the excise tax.  The severance payments and       benefits provided for above are conditioned upon our receipt of a release of claims from Mr. Messenger.

Other Agreements
In January 2018, we entered into aircraft time sharing agreements with Dale Francescon, Robert J. Francescon, and David L. Messenger, which govern       their personal use of the Company's aircraft during their employment and their reimbursement of the Company for the costs of any such use.  The lease rate payable by the executives thereunder equals the aggregate incremental per hour cost of each       flight, as such cost is described in the agreements.  Use of the aircraft by the executives is subject to prior approval of the Co-Chief Executive Officers, and is at all times subordinate to use by the Company.  Each of the agreements has an initial       term of one year, and provides for automatic one-year extensions thereafter, unless (i) either party provides the other with at least 30 days' prior written notice of non-renewal, or (ii) the agreement is terminated on shorter notice as provided       therein.

 ______________________
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Amounts reported represent potential future payouts under our short-term incentive plan. Actual payouts under this plan are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan                  Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Amounts reported represent the range of PSU award payouts for the 2018 to 2020 performance period.  The range includes an "above target" payout which would result in the                  following payouts: Dale Francescon (83,582); Robert J. Francescon (83,582); and David L. Messenger (35,820). Information regarding the PSU awards is set forth under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Named Executive Officer Compensation—Long-Term Incentives."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Amounts reported represent RSU awards. The RSU awards granted on February 7, 2018 were payouts under our prior LTI program upon the achievement of a performance metric that                  was established in March 2016 and will vest and become issuable on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the executive's continued employment with us.  The RSU awards granted on April 19, 2018 are part of our 2018 LTI                  program and will vest and become issuable in equal installments on the first, second, and third year anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the executive's continued employment with us.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Amounts reported represent the grant date fair value of the RSU and PSU awards granted to our NEOs, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, based on the closing price                  of our common stock on the grant dates of February 7, 2018 ($30.50), and April 19, 2018 ($30.15), as reported by the NYSE, and assuming target levels of performance for the PSU awards. The RSU and PSU awards will vest upon certain                  terminations of employment and upon a change in control if the award is not continued, assumed, or substituted with equivalent awards by the successor entity.  
[END TABLE]
As previously discussed, the use of PSU awards led to a change in the accounting for our LTI program, resulting in a substantial increase in       reported equity-based compensation for our NEOs in 2018 compared to 2017, even though the NEOs' actual year-over-year compensation did not materially increase.

 POTENTIAL POST-TERMINATION AND CHANGE IN CONTROL PAYMENTS  
[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements
As previously described, the employment agreements with each of our NEOs contains severance provisions, including in connection with a change in       control, intended to induce these executives to continue employment with our Company and to retain them and provide consideration to them for certain restrictive covenants that apply following a termination of employment.  The receipt of any       severance by these executives is conditioned upon his execution of a release of claims.  These employment agreements are described under "Executive Compensation         —Employment and Other Agreements."
Other Change in Control Arrangements
The Century Communities, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan under which awards have been granted to our NEOs contains "change in control"       provisions.  Under the plan, without limiting the authority of the Compensation Committee to adjust awards, if a "change in control" of Century (as defined in the plan) occurs, then, unless otherwise provided in the award or other agreement, if an       award is continued, assumed, or substituted by the successor entity, the award will not vest or lapse solely as a result of the change of control but will instead remain outstanding under the terms pursuant to which it has been continued, assumed, or       substituted and will continue to vest or lapse pursuant to such terms.  If the award is continued, assumed, or substituted by the successor entity and within two years following the change in control the executive is either terminated by the       successor entity without "cause" or, if the executive is an executive officer of Century, resigns for "good reason," each as defined in the plan, or if outstanding awards that are not continued, assumed, or substituted with equivalent awards by the       successor entity in connection with the change in control, then:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· all performance-based awards for which the performance period has not been completed as of the date of such termination, resignation or change in control, as applicable, held                  by such participant will immediately vest and be earned in full and paid out with respect to each performance goal based on actual performance achieved through the date of termination, resignation or change in control, as applicable, with                  the manner of payment to be made in cash or shares, as provided in the award agreement, within 30 days following the date of termination, resignation or change in control, as applicable, and provided that if payment in the change in control                  transaction is made in shares, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion provide the holder the consideration provided to other similarly situated stockholders in the change in control.

 CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE   
[END TABLE]
Under Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K, we are required to provide the ratio of the annual total       compensation of each of Dale Francescon, our Co-CEO, and Robert J. Francescon, our Co-CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our Co-CEOs).  This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a       manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below.  The SEC rules for identifying the "median employee" and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation       allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices.  Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be       comparable to the pay ratio reported by us, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.
For 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the annual total compensation of our Co-CEOs was $7,517,693, in the case of Dale Francescon, and $7,517,555, in the case of Robert J. Francescon;  
· the annual total compensation of the employee identified at median of our Company (other than our Co-CEOs), was $94,381;  
· based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of each of our Co-CEOs to the annual total compensation of our median employee (identified in accordance                  with SEC rules and as described in greater detail below) was estimated to be 80:1; and  
· excluding the portion of equity-based compensation attributable to the 2016 LTI payouts ($2.0 million), the CEO pay ratio is 58:1.  
[END TABLE]
To identify our median employee and to calculate the annual total compensation of our median employee and that of our co-CEOs, we used the       following methodology, assumptions, and estimates:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Selection of Determination Date and Employee Population.                   As permitted under SEC rules, we selected December 31, 2018 as the date to identify our employee population and "median employee". We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our entire employee population, excluding our Co-CEOs, consisted                  of 1,377 total employees.  In determining this population, we considered the employees of our subsidiaries and all of our employees other than our Co-CEOs, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary, or seasonal basis.  We did                  not include any contractors or other non-employee workers in our employee population.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Identification of Median Employee.  To identify the "median                  employee" from our employee population, we selected W-2 earnings as the most appropriate measure of compensation.  To make them comparable, the W-2 earnings for newly hired permanent employees who had worked less than a year were                  annualized.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Calculation of Annual Total Compensation.  We then                  calculated annual total compensation for this median employee and each of our Co-CEOs using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in our Summary Compensation Table included under "—Summary Compensation Table."

 COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT   
[END TABLE]
As a result of our annual assessment on risk in our compensation programs, we concluded that our compensation policies, practices, and programs and       related compensation governance structure work together in a manner so as to encourage our employees, including our NEOs, to pursue growth strategies that emphasize stockholder value creation, but not to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could       threaten the value of our company.  As part of our assessment, we noted in particular the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual base salaries for employees are not subject to performance risk and, for most non-executive employees, constitute the largest part of their total compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· performance-based, or at risk, compensation awarded to our employees, which for our higher-level employees constitutes the largest part of their total compensation, is                  appropriately balanced between annual and long-term performance and cash and equity compensation and utilizes several different performance measures and goals that are drivers of long-term success for our Company and stockholders, and has                  appropriate maximums; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a significant portion of performance-based compensation is in the form of long-term equity incentives, which do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk because they                  generally have a three-year performance period or vest over a three-year period of time, thereby focusing our employees on our long-term interests.  
[END TABLE]

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
 OVERVIEW    
[END TABLE]
Our non-employee director compensation program generally is designed to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable directors and to provide       equity-based compensation to align the interests of our directors with those of our stockholders.  In 2018, our non-employee director compensation was comprised of equity compensation, in the form of annual RSU awards, and cash compensation, in the       form of annual retainers.  Each of these components is described in more detail below.  Dale Francescon and Robert J. Francescon, as employee directors, do not receive any additional compensation for their service as directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROCESS   
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation Committee the responsibility, among other things, to review and recommend to the Board any       proposed changes in non-employee director compensation.  In connection with such review, the Compensation Committee is assisted in performing its duties by our Human Resources Department and also engages an independent external compensation       consultant to provide analysis regarding non-employee director compensation.
During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook to review our non-employee director compensation.  FW Cook's review consisted of, among       other things, analysis of board compensation trends and a competitive assessment based on a selected group of companies operating in the United States that are similarly situated to us from a revenue and market capitalization perspective.  The peer       group used for this analysis was the same peer group used for the executive compensation analysis.  The Compensation Committee considered this data in determining whether to recommend any changes to our non-employee director compensation program.        Overall, the review by FW Cook showed that our non-employee director compensation program was aligned with market trends from a design perspective and aligned with our target positioning from a compensation level standpoint, other than certain Board       committee chair roles and the equity component.  Accordingly, on May 9, 2018, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the following changes to our non-employee director compensation program during 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· increase the additional cash retainer to be paid to the Chair of the Audit Committee from $14,000 to $15,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· increase the additional cash retainer to be paid to the Chair of the Compensation Committee from $10,000 to $12,500;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· increase the Black-Scholes value of the annual restricted stock unit awards to be granted to each non-employee director who is initially elected or re-elected by the                  Company's stockholders at each annual meeting of stockholders from $100,000 to $120,000 and change the vesting of such annual restricted stock unit awards from a 3-year ratable vesting to a 1-year cliff vesting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· change the stock ownership guideline for each director from 3 times the director's annual Board cash retainer to 5 times the director's annual Board cash retainer.

The number of shares of our common stock underlying each annual RSU award is determined by dividing the $120,000 equity value by the closing price of our common stock on the       date of grant.
We also reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties as       directors, including, without limitation, travel expenses in connection with their attendance in-person at Board and Board committee meetings.

 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS  
[END TABLE]
For the period beginning on January 1, 2018, to the date of this proxy statement, the following are our current arrangements with a related party:
Employment and Other Agreements with Named Executive Officers
We have entered into an employment agreement with each of our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dale Francescon and Robert J. Francescon, and our Chief       Financial Officer, David L. Messenger.  These agreements were entered into with these individuals in connection with their capacities as officers, and provide for salary, bonus, and other benefits, including the grant of equity awards, and severance       upon a termination of employment under certain circumstances.  In January 2018, we entered into aircraft time sharing agreements with our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dale Francescon and Robert J. Francescon, and our Chief Financial Officer, David L.       Messenger.  Please see the sections above entitled "Executive Compensation—Employment and Other Agreements" for a description of these agreements.
Indemnification Agreements
We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors, Co-Chief Executive Officers, and Chief Financial Officer.  These       agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as       to which they could be indemnified.  We believe that the limitation of liability provision in our charter and the indemnification agreements will facilitate our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and       officers.
Other Related Party Transactions
We intend to hire James Francescon, the son of Robert J. Francescon, our Co-Chief Executive Officer, as Corporate Vice President commencing on or       about April 30, 2019.

Mr.       James Francescon's annual compensation is commensurate with that of his peers.

We have established stock ownership guidelines that are intended to further align the interests of our directors and named executive officers with       those of our stockholders.  The stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and named executive officers are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position   Guideline  
 Non-Employee Director   5x annual cash retainer  
 Co-Chief Executive Officers   6x annual base salary  
 Other Named Executive Officers   3x annual base salary  
[END TABLE]
Each director and named executive officer has five years from the date of appointment or hire or, if the ownership multiple has increased during       his tenure, five years from the date established in connection with such increase to reach his stock ownership targets.  Until the applicable stock ownership target is achieved, each director and Co-Chief Executive Officer subject to the guidelines       is required to retain an amount equal to 100% of the net shares received as a result of the vesting of restricted stock awards or restricted stock unit awards, and other named executive officers are required to retain an amount equal to 60% of the       net shares received as a result of the vesting of restricted stock awards or restricted stock unit awards.  All of our directors and named executive officers are in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines.
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity       securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE.  Executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  To our       knowledge, based on the information furnished by the reporting persons, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% stockholders were complied with on a timely basis       during the year ended December 31, 2018, except that each of Dale Francescon, Robert J. Francescon, David L. Messenger, and Scott Dixon filed one late report on Form 4 reporting the vesting and withholding of shares received pursuant to the vesting       of restricted stock units.

Date of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
We anticipate that our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (2020 Annual Meeting) will be held on Wednesday, May 6, 2020.
Proposals Pursuant to Rule 14a-8
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, our stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in the proxy statement and for       consideration at our next annual meeting of stockholders.  To be eligible for inclusion in the 2020 proxy statement, a proposal must be received by us no later than November 26, 2019, and must otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8.  While the Board will       consider stockholder proposals, we reserve the right to omit from the proxy statement stockholder proposals that we are not required to include under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8.
Nominations and Proposals Pursuant to Our Bylaws
Under our Bylaws, a stockholder wishing to nominate a candidate for election to the Board, or propose other business for consideration, at the 2020       Annual Meeting of Stockholders is required to give written notice of such stockholder's intention to make such a nomination or proposal to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 8390 East Crescent Parkway, Suite 650, Greenwood       Village, Colorado 80111, Attention: Corporate Secretary.  In order for a stockholder proposal for director nominations or other business, outside of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, to come before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such       notice of nomination or proposal must be made in accordance with our Bylaws, which require appropriate notice to us of the nomination or proposal not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of such Annual Meeting of Stockholders.        A notice of nomination or proposal is also required to contain specific information as required by our Bylaws.  A nomination which does not comply with the requirements of our Bylaws may not be considered.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance       Committee will consider validly nominated director candidates and will provide its recommendations to the Board.  In general, to be timely, we must receive the notice of nomination or proposal not later than the 90th day nor earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting.  In       this regard, we must receive the notice of nomination or proposal no earlier than January 8, 2020, and no later than February 7, 2020.
The Board of Directors is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting from our stockholders.  We will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from       our stockholders.  In addition to the solicitation of proxies by delivery of the Internet Notice or this proxy statement by mail, we will request that brokers, banks, and other nominees that hold shares of our common stock, which are beneficially       owned by our stockholders, send Internet Notices, proxies, and proxy materials to those beneficial owners and secure those beneficial owners' voting instructions.  We will reimburse those record holders for their reasonable expenses.  Although we       currently do not intend to hire a proxy solicitor to assist in the solicitation of proxies, we reserve the right to do so if we believe it would be in the best interests of Century and our stockholders.  If we engage a proxy solicitor, we expect the       fees to be approximately $5,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses.  We may use several of our regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from our stockholders, either personally or by Internet, telephone, facsimile, or       special delivery letter.
Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as banks and brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy       statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders.  This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means       extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.  A number of banks and brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be householding our proxy materials.  A single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple       stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders.  Once you have received notice from your bank or broker that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will       continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent.  If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, please notify your bank or       broker, direct your written request to Century Communities, Inc., 8390 East Crescent Parkway, Suite 650, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, Attention: Investor Relations, or contact Investor Relations by telephone at (303) 268-8398.  Stockholders who       currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their bank or broker.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of our previous filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange       Act, which might incorporate future filings made by us under those statutes, the Audit Committee Report under "Proposal No. 2. Ratification of Appointment of         Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" will not be incorporated by reference into any of those prior filings, nor will any such report be incorporated by reference into any future filings made by us under those statutes.  In       addition, information on our website, other than this proxy statement, notice, and form of proxy, is not part of the proxy soliciting materials and is not incorporated herein by reference.
Our 2018 Annual Report, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the financial statement       schedules thereto, for the year ended December 31, 2018, are available without charge upon written request to:  Century Communities, Inc., 8390 East Crescent Parkway, Suite 650, Greenwood Village, Colorado 80111, Attention: Investor Relations.

Century             Communities, Inc. – 2019 Proxy Statement  
ANNEX I – RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In this proxy statement, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income and adjusted net income per       diluted share.  These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide stockholders additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present operations.  We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information       to investors because they are used to evaluate our performance on a comparable year-over-year basis.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted       accounting principles (GAAP) and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles.        Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of other companies using the same or similar names limiting, to some extent, the usefulness of such measures for comparison purposes.  Non-GAAP financial       measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP.  These measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the       corresponding GAAP measures.  Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP financial information is presented.
The following table presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial       measure we use as a supplemental measure in evaluating operating performance.  We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income before (i) income tax expense, (ii) interest in cost of home sales revenues, (iii) other interest expense, (iv)       depreciation and amortization expense, and (v) adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting for acquired work in process inventory related to business combinations.  We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides an indicator of general       economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates, levels of depreciation or amortization, and items considered to be non-recurring.  Accordingly, our management believes that this measurement is       useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period.  Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, consolidated net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance.  Our       presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.  Our Adjusted EBITDA is limited as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or       as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

I-  
Adjusted net income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our       financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of certain non-recurring items.  We believe excluding certain non-recurring items provides more comparable assessment of our financial       results from period to period.  Adjusted net income per diluted share is calculated by excluding the effect of acquisition costs and purchase price accounting for acquired work in process from the calculation of reported net income per share.

1.  Purpose of Plan.  
[END TABLE]
The purpose of the Century Communities, Inc. Amended and Restated 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (this "Plan") is to advance the interests of  Century Communities, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and its       stockholders by enabling the Company and its Subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified individuals to perform services for the Company and its Subsidiaries, providing incentive compensation for such individuals that is linked to the growth and       profitability of the Company and increases in stockholder value and aligning the interests of such individuals with the interests of its stockholders through opportunities for equity participation in the Company. The original version of this Plan       initially became effective upon its approval by the Company's stockholders on May 10, 2017 (the "Initial Effective Date") and at that time replaced the Century       Communities, Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "Prior Plan"), although awards outstanding under the Prior Plan as of the Initial       Effective Date remained outstanding in accordance with their terms. After the Initial Effective Date, no more grants of awards were made under the Prior Plan. This Plan has been approved by the Board and shall become effective upon approval by the       stockholders of the Company on May 8, 2019 (the "Effective Date") and shall affect only Awards granted on or after the Effective Date; provided, however, the limits in       Section 4 of this Plan shall apply to all Awards granted on or after the Initial Effective Date.

If determined by the Committee, such         determination will be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes and on all persons, including the Company, the stockholders of the Company, the Participants and their respective successors-in-interest.

Any good faith determination of "Good Reason" made by the Committee will be conclusive.

3.  Plan Administration.  
[END TABLE]
3.1          The Committee.  The Plan will be administered by the Committee.  The Committee will act by majority approval of the members at a meeting or by unanimous written consent, and a majority of         the members of the Committee will constitute a quorum.  The Committee may exercise its duties, power and authority under this Plan in its sole discretion without the consent of any Participant or other party, unless this Plan specifically provides         otherwise.  The Committee will not be obligated to treat Participants or Eligible Recipients uniformly, and determinations made under this Plan may be made by the Committee selectively among Participants or Eligible Recipients, whether or not such         Participants and Eligible Recipients are similarly situated.  Each determination, interpretation or other action made or taken by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Plan will be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes and on         all persons, and no member of the Committee will be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to this Plan or any Award granted under this Plan. 3.2          Authority of the Committee.  In accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Plan, the Committee will have full and exclusive discretionary power and authority to take such         actions as it deems necessary and advisable with respect to the administration of this Plan, including the following:
(a)          To         designate the Eligible Recipients to be selected as Participants;

(c)          To         determine the time or times when Awards will be granted;
(d)          To         determine the duration of each Award;
(e)          To         determine the terms, restrictions and other conditions to which the grant of an Award or the payment or vesting of Awards may be subject;
(f)          To         construe and interpret this Plan and Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration and in so doing, to correct any defect, omission, or inconsistency in this Plan or in an Award Agreement,         in a manner and to the extent it will deem necessary or expedient to make this Plan fully effective;
(g)          To         determine Fair Market Value in accordance with Section 2.28 of this Plan;

(j)          To         authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any Award Agreement or any other instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Committee;
(k)          To         determine whether Awards will be settled in shares of Common Stock, cash or in any combination thereof; (l)          To         determine whether Awards will be adjusted for dividend equivalents, with "Dividend Equivalents" meaning a credit, made at the discretion of the Committee, to the account of a Participant in an amount equal to the cash dividends paid on one share of         Common Stock for each share of Common Stock represented by an Award held by such Participant, subject to Section 14 of this Plan and any other provision of this Plan and which Dividend Equivalents may be subject to the same conditions and         restrictions as the Awards to which they attach and may be settled in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock, or in any combination of both; and
(m)          To         impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any shares of Common Stock, including restrictions         under an insider trading policy, stock ownership guidelines, restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers and other restrictions designed to increase equity ownership by Participants or otherwise         align the interests of Participants with the Company's stockholders.

At all times, the delegate appointed under this Section 3.3 will serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Committee.
3.4          No Re-pricing.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan other than Section 4.5 of this Plan, the Committee may not, without prior approval of the Company's stockholders, seek to         effect any re-pricing of any previously granted, "underwater" Option or Stock Appreciation Right by: (a) amending or modifying the terms of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to lower the exercise price or grant price; (b) canceling the         underwater Option or Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for (i) cash; (ii) replacement Options or Stock Appreciation Rights having a lower exercise price or grant price; or (iii) other Awards; or (c) repurchasing the underwater Options or Stock         Appreciation Rights and granting new Awards under this Plan.  For purposes of this Section 3.4, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be deemed to be "underwater" at any time when the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is less than the         exercise price of the Option or grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right.
3.5          Participants Based Outside of the United States.  In addition to the authority of the Committee under Section 3.2(i) and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Committee         may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of this Plan or Awards with respect to Participants resident outside of the United States or employed by a non-U.S. Subsidiary in order to comply with local legal requirements, to otherwise protect the         Company's or Subsidiary's interests or to meet objectives of this Plan, and may, where appropriate, establish one or more sub-plans (including the adoption of any required rules and regulations) for the purposes of qualifying for preferred tax         treatment under foreign tax laws.  The Committee will have no authority, however, to take action pursuant to this Section 3.5:  (a) to reserve shares of Common Stock or grant Awards in excess of the limitations provided in Section 4.1 of this Plan;         (b) to effect any re-pricing in violation of Section 3.4 of this Plan; (c) to grant Options or Stock Appreciation Rights having an exercise price or grant price less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common         Stock on the Grant Date in violation of Section 6.3 or Section 7.3 of this Plan; or (d) for which stockholder approval would then be required pursuant to Section 21.3 of this Plan.

4.  Shares Available for Issuance.  
[END TABLE]
4.1          Maximum Number of Shares Available.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5 of this Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that will be available for issuance under         this Plan will be the sum of:
(a)          2,481,000 shares of Common Stock; plus
(b)          the         number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for issuance under the Prior Plan but not subject to outstanding awards as of the Initial Effective Date; plus
(c)          the         number of additional shares of Common Stock subject to awards outstanding under the Prior Plan as of the Initial Effective Date but only to the extent that such outstanding awards are forfeited, cancelled, expire or otherwise terminate without the         issuance of such shares of Common Stock after the Initial Effective Date.
4.2          Limits on Incentive Stock Options and Non-Employee Director Awards.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan to the contrary and subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.5         of this Plan,
(a)          the         maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that will be available for issuance pursuant to Incentive Stock Options under this Plan will be 2,481,000 shares;             and
(b)          the         sum of any cash compensation, or other compensation, and the value (determined as of the grant date in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or any successor thereto) of Awards granted to         a Non-Employee Director as compensation for services as a Non-Employee Director during any fiscal year of the Company may not exceed $400,000 (increased to $600,000 with respect to any Non-Employee Director serving as Chairman of the Board or Lead         Independent Director or in the fiscal year of a non-employee Director's initial service as a Non-Employee Director) (with any compensation that is deferred counting towards this limit for the year in which the compensation is first earned, and not         a later year of settlement). 4.3          Accounting for Awards.  Shares of Common Stock that are issued under this Plan or that are subject to outstanding Awards will be applied to reduce the maximum number of shares of Common         Stock remaining available for issuance under this Plan; provided, however, that         the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right or other Stock-Based Award will be counted against the shares authorized for issuance under this Plan, regardless of the number of shares actually issued         upon settlement of such Stock Appreciation Right or other Stock-Based Award.  Furthermore, any shares of Common Stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations on Awards issued under this Plan, any shares of Common Stock withheld to pay the         exercise price or grant price of Awards under this Plan and any shares of Common Stock not issued or delivered as a result of the "net exercise" of an outstanding Option pursuant to Section 6.5 or settlement of a Stock Appreciation Right in shares         of Common Stock pursuant to Section 7.7 will be counted against the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under this Plan and will not be available again for grant under this Plan.  Shares of Common Stock subject to Awards settled in cash         will again be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan. Any shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company on the open market using the proceeds from the exercise of an Award will not increase the number of shares of         Common Stock available for future grant of Awards.  Any shares of Common Stock related to Awards granted under this Plan or under the Prior Plan that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of the shares         of Common Stock, will be available again for grant under this Plan and correspondingly increase the total number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan under Section 4.1. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shares         of Common Stock issued in assumption of, or in substitution for, any outstanding awards of any entity acquired in any form of combination by the Company or a Subsidiary pursuant to Section 22 of this Plan or otherwise will not be counted against         shares of Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to this Plan. The shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan may be authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.

In applying the foregoing Annual Award Limits, (i) all Awards of the specified type granted to the same person in the same Plan Year will be       aggregated and made subject to one limit; (ii) the Share limits applicable to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights refer to the number of Shares underlying such Awards; (iii) the Share limit under clause (b), (c) or (f) refers to the maximum number       of Shares that may be delivered, or the value of which could be paid in cash or other property, under an Award or Awards of the type specified in clause (b), (c) or (f) assuming a maximum payout; (iv) Awards other than Cash-Based Awards that are       settled in cash will count against the applicable share limit under clause (a), (b), (c) or (f) and not against the dollar limit under clause (d) or (e); and (v) the dollar limit under clause (d) or (e) refers to the maximum dollar amount payable       under an Award or Awards of the type specified in clause (d) or (e) assuming a maximum payout. 4.5          Adjustments to Shares and Awards.
(a)          In the         event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, rights offering, divestiture or extraordinary dividend (including a spin off) or any other         similar change in the corporate structure or shares of Common Stock the Company, the Committee (or, if the Company is not the surviving corporation in any such transaction, the board of directors of the surviving corporation) will make appropriate         adjustment or substitutions (which determination will be conclusive) as to: (i) the number and kind of securities or other property (including cash) available for issuance or payment under this Plan, including the sub-limits set forth in Section         4.2 of this Plan and the Annual Award Limits set forth in Section 4.4 of this Plan, and (ii) in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Participants, the number and kind of securities or other property (including cash) subject to         outstanding Awards and the exercise price of outstanding Awards; provided, however,         that this Section 4.5 will not limit the authority of the Committee to take action pursuant to Section 17 of this Plan in the event of a Change in Control.  The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments and/or substitutions, if         any, will be final, conclusive and binding on Participants under this Plan.
(b)          Notwithstanding             anything else herein to the contrary, without affecting the number of shares of Common Stock reserved or available hereunder, the limits in Section 4.2 of this Plan and the Annual Award Limits in Section 4.4 of this Plan, the Committee may         authorize the issuance or assumption of benefits under this Plan in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock or reorganization upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, subject to compliance with         the rules under Sections 422, 424 and 409A of the Code, as and where applicable.
4.6          Minimum Vesting Requirements on Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, but subject to Sections 4.5 and 17 of the Plan, equity-based Awards granted under         the Plan will vest no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the date the Award is granted and any Awards under this Plan which vest upon the attainment of Performance Goals will provide for a Performance Period of at least one (1) year;         provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Awards that result in the issuance of an aggregate of up to five percent (5%) of the shares of Common Stock available pursuant to Section 4.1 above may be granted to any one or more eligible         Directors, Consultants or Employees without respect to such minimum vesting condition. Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall preclude the Committee from taking action, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the vesting of any Award in connection with or         following a Participant's death, disability, termination of employment or service or otherwise, or the consummation of a Change in Control. This Section 4.6 will be inapplicable to (i) substitute Awards granted pursuant to Section 22 of this Plan,         (ii) shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash Awards and (iii) Awards to Non-Employee Directors that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the           date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting.
4.7          Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if a Participant is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, this Plan, the Award, and         the Award Agreement will be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application         of such exemptive rule, and such additional limitations will be deemed to be incorporated by reference into such Award to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. 4.8          Holding Period. Any net shares of Common Stock received by a Participant who is an executive officer of the Company in connection with the vesting or settlement of an Award under this         Plan must be held by the Participant for at least twelve (12) months after such vesting or settlement, or if earlier, termination of employment or satisfaction of the Company's stock ownership guidelines, as in effect from time to time. For         purposes of this Section 4.8, "net shares" means those shares of Common Stock that remain after shares of Common Stock are sold or netted to pay the exercise price of Options or grant price of Stock Appreciation Rights (if applicable) and any         applicable withholding or estimated taxes associated with an Option, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit, Deferred Stock Unit, or other Stock-Based Award under this Plan.

5.  Participation.  
[END TABLE]
Participants in this Plan will be those Eligible Recipients who, in the judgment of the Committee, have contributed, are contributing or are       expected to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Company or its Subsidiaries.  Eligible Recipients may be granted from time to time one or more Awards, singly or in combination or in tandem with other Awards, as may be determined by       the Committee in its sole discretion.  Awards will be deemed to be granted as of the date specified in the grant resolution of the Committee, which date will be the Grant Date of any related Award Agreement with the Participant.
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  Options.  
[END TABLE]
6.1          Grant.  An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Options under this Plan, and such Options will be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of         this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted solely to eligible Employees of the Company or a Subsidiary. The Committee may designate whether an Option is to be considered an         Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock Option.  To the extent that any Incentive Stock Option (or portion thereof) granted under this Plan ceases for any reason to qualify as an "incentive stock option" for purposes of Section 422 of the         Code, such Incentive Stock Option (or portion thereof) will continue to be outstanding for purposes of this Plan but will thereafter be deemed to be a Non-Statutory Stock Option. Options may be granted to an Eligible Recipient for services provided         to a Subsidiary only if, with respect to such Eligible Recipient, the underlying shares of Common Stock constitute "service recipient stock" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii) promulgated under the Code.
6.2          Award Agreement.  Each Option grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the exercise price of the Option, the maximum duration of the Option, the number of shares of         Common Stock to which the Option pertains, the conditions upon which an Option will become vested and exercisable, and such other provisions as the Committee will determine which are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan.  The Award         Agreement also will specify whether the Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option or a Non-Statutory Stock Option.
6.3          Exercise Price.  The per share price to be paid by a Participant upon exercise of an Option granted pursuant to this Section 6 will be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion         at the time of the Option grant; provided, however, that such price will not be         less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the Grant Date (one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value if, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, the Participant owns,         directly or indirectly, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company). 6.4          Exercisability and Duration.  An Option will become exercisable at such times and in such installments and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee in its sole         discretion at the time of grant, including (a) the achievement of one or more of the Performance Goals; or that (b) the Participant remain in the continuous employment or service with the Company or a Subsidiary for a certain period; provided, however, that no Option may be exercisable after ten (10) years from the         Grant Date (five (5) years from the Grant Date in the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Participant who owns, directly or indirectly, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the         Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of an Option that is exercisable in accordance with its terms is prevented by the provisions of Section 19 of this Plan, the Option         will remain exercisable until thirty (30) days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provisions, but in any event no later than the expiration date of such Option.
6.5          Payment of Exercise Price.
(a)          The         total purchase price of the shares of Common Stock to be purchased upon exercise of an Option will be paid entirely in cash (including check, bank draft or money order); provided,         however, that the Committee, in its sole discretion and upon terms and conditions established by the Committee, may allow such payments to be made, in whole or in         part, by (i) tender of a Broker Exercise Notice; (ii) by tender, either by actual delivery or attestation as to ownership, of Previously Acquired Shares; (iii) a "net exercise" of the Option (as further described in paragraph (b), below); (iv) by a         combination of such methods; or (v) any other method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, no Participant who is a Director or an "executive officer" of the         Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act will be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under this Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to such payment with a loan from the Company or a         loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.
(b)          In the         case of a "net exercise" of an Option, the Company will not require a payment of the exercise price of the Option from the Participant but will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise by the largest number of whole         shares that has a Fair Market Value on the exercise date that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price for the shares exercised under this method.  Shares of Common Stock will no longer be outstanding under an Option (and will therefore not         thereafter be exercisable) following the exercise of such Option to the extent of (i) shares used to pay the exercise price of an Option under the "net exercise," (ii) shares actually delivered to the Participant as a result of such exercise and         (iii) any shares withheld for purposes of tax withholding pursuant to Section 16 of this Plan.
(c)          For         purposes of such payment, Previously Acquired Shares tendered or covered by an attestation will be valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date of the Option.
6.6          Manner of Exercise.  An Option may be exercised by a Participant in whole or in part from time to time, subject to the conditions contained in this Plan and in the Award Agreement         evidencing such Option, by delivery in person, by facsimile or electronic transmission or through the mail of written notice of exercise to the Company at its principal executive office (or to the Company's designee as may be established from time         to time by the Company and communicated to Participants) and by paying in full the total exercise price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased in accordance with Section 6.5 of this Plan.

7.  Stock Appreciation Rights.  
[END TABLE]
7.1         Grant.  An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Stock Appreciation Rights under this Plan, and such Stock Appreciation Rights will be subject to such terms and conditions,         consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to an Eligible Recipient for services provided to a Subsidiary only if, with respect to such         Eligible Recipient, the underlying shares of Common Stock constitute "service recipient stock" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii) promulgated under the Code.
7.2        Award Agreement.  Each Stock Appreciation Right will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right, the term of the Stock         Appreciation Right, and such other provisions as the Committee will determine which are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan.
7.3          Grant Price.  The grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right will be determined by the Committee, in its discretion, at the Grant Date; provided, however, that such price may not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of one share of         Common Stock on the Grant Date.
7.4          Exercisability and Duration.  A Stock Appreciation Right will become exercisable at such times and in such installments as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion at the         time of grant; provided, however, that no Stock Appreciation Right may be         exercisable after ten (10) years from its Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right that is exercisable in accordance with its terms is prevented by the provisions of Section 19 of this Plan, the Stock         Appreciation Right will remain exercisable until thirty (30) days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provisions, but in any event no later than the expiration date of such Stock Appreciation Right.
7.5          Manner of Exercise.  A Stock Appreciation Right will be exercised by giving notice in the same manner as for Options, as set forth in Section 6.6 of this Plan, subject to any other terms         and conditions consistent with the other provisions of this Plan as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
7.6          Settlement.  Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
(a)          The         excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the per share grant price; by
(b)          The         number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.
7.7          Form of Payment.  Payment, if any, with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right settled in accordance with Section 7.6 of this Plan will be made in accordance with the terms of the         applicable Award Agreement, in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, as the Committee determines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units.  
[END TABLE]
8.1          Grant.  An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units under this Plan, and such Awards will be subject to such         terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Restricted Stock Units will be similar to Restricted Stock Awards except that no shares of Common Stock are         actually awarded to the Participant on the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock Units. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units will be denominated in shares of Common Stock but paid in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and         shares of Common Stock as the Committee, in its sole discretion, will determine, and as provided in the Award Agreement.
8.2          Award Agreement. Each Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit grant will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the type of Award, the period(s)         of restriction, the number of shares of restricted Common Stock, or the number of Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units granted, and such other provisions as the Committee will determine that are not inconsistent with the terms of this         Plan.
8.3          Conditions and Restrictions.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan, including Sections 4.6 and 4.8 of this Plan, the Committee will impose such conditions or restrictions on a         Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units granted pursuant to this Plan as it may deem advisable including a requirement that Participants pay a stipulated purchase price for each share of Common Stock underlying a         Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit, restrictions based upon the achievement of specific Performance Goals, time-based restrictions on vesting following the attainment of the Performance Goals, time-based         restrictions, restrictions under Applicable Laws or holding requirements or sale restrictions placed on the shares of Common Stock by the Company upon vesting of such Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units.
8.4          Voting Rights.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in a Participant's Award Agreement, to the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, as determined by the         Committee, Participants holding a Restricted Stock Award granted hereunder will be granted the right to exercise full voting rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Award during the Period of Restriction.         A Participant will have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units granted hereunder.
8.5          Dividend Rights.
(a)          Unless         otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in a Participant's Award Agreement, to the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, as determined by the Committee, Participants holding a Restricted Stock Award granted hereunder will have         the same dividend rights as the Company's other stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing any such dividends as to a Restricted Stock Award that is subject to vesting requirements will be subject to forfeiture and termination to the same extent         as the Restricted Stock Award to which such dividends relate and the Award Agreement may require that any cash dividends be reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock Award and subject to the same conditions and         restrictions as the Restricted Stock Award with respect to which the dividends were paid. In no event will dividends with respect to Restricted Stock Awards that are subject to vesting be paid or distributed until the vesting provisions of such         Restricted Stock Award lapse. (b)          Unless         otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in a Participant's Award Agreement, to the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, as determined by the Committee, prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Restricted Stock Units or Deferred         Stock Unit awarded under this Plan may, at the Committee's discretion, carry with it a right to Dividend Equivalents. Such right entitles the Participant to be credited with any amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one share of Common Stock         while the Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit is outstanding.  Dividend Equivalents may be converted into additional Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units and may (and will, to the extent required below) be made subject to the         same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units to which they attach. Settlement of Dividend Equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of both.         Dividend Equivalents as to Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units will be subject to forfeiture and termination to the same extent as the corresponding Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units as to which the Dividend Equivalents         relate. In no event will Participants holding Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units receive any Dividend Equivalents on such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units until the vesting provisions of such Restricted Stock Units or         Deferred Stock Units lapse.
8.6          Enforcement of Restrictions.  To enforce the restrictions referred to in this Section 8, the Committee may place a legend on the stock certificates representing Restricted Stock Awards         referring to such restrictions and may require the Participant, until the restrictions have lapsed, to keep the stock certificates, together with duly endorsed stock powers, in the custody of the Company or its transfer agent, or to maintain         evidence of stock ownership, together with duly endorsed stock powers, in a certificateless book entry stock account with the Company's transfer agent. Alternatively, Restricted Stock Awards may be held in non-certificated form pursuant to such         terms and conditions as the Company may establish with its registrar and transfer agent or any third-party administrator designated by the Company to hold Restricted Stock Awards on behalf of Participants.
8.7          Lapse of Restrictions; Settlement. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, including without limitation this Section 8 or Section 4.8 and 18.4 of this Plan, shares of Common Stock         underlying a Restricted Stock Award will become freely transferable by the Participant after all conditions and restrictions applicable to such shares have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable tax withholding         obligations).  Upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit, the Restricted Stock Unit will be settled, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement, (a) in cash, based upon the Fair Market Value of the vested underlying         shares of Common Stock, (b) in shares of Common Stock or (c) a combination thereof, as provided in the Award Agreement, except to the extent that a Participant has properly elected to defer income that may be attributable to a Restricted Stock Unit         under a Company deferred compensation plan or arrangement.
8.8          Section 83(b) Election for Restricted Stock Award.  If a Participant makes an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to a Restricted Stock Award, the Participant must         file, within thirty (30) days following the Grant Date of the Restricted Stock Award, a copy of such election with the Company and with the Internal Revenue Service, in accordance with the regulations under Section 83 of the Code.  The Committee         may provide in the Award Agreement that the Restricted Stock Award is conditioned upon the Participant's making or refraining from making an election with respect to the award under Section 83(b) of the Code.
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  Performance Awards.  
[END TABLE]
9.1          Grant.  An Eligible Recipient may be granted one or more Performance Awards under this Plan, and such Awards will be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other         provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, including the achievement of one or more Performance Goals. 9.2          Award Agreement. Each Performance Award will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the amount of cash, shares of Common Stock, other Awards, or combination of both to be         received by the Participant upon payout of the Performance Award, any Performance Goals upon which the Performance Award is subject, any Performance Period during which any Performance Goals must be achieved and such other provisions as the         Committee will determine which are not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan.
9.3          Vesting.  Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee may impose such restrictions or conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, to the vesting of such         Performance Awards as it deems appropriate, including the achievement of one or more of the Performance Goals.
9.4          Earning of Performance Award Payment.  Subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award Agreement, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Awards will         be entitled to receive payout on the value and number of Performance Awards earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding Performance Goals have been achieved and such         other restrictions or conditions imposed on the vesting and payout of the Performance Awards has been satisfied.
9.5          Reassignment. If prior to the end of a Performance Period, but after the conclusion of one year of the Performance Period, a Participant holding Performance Awards is reassigned to a         position with the Company or any Subsidiary, and that position is not eligible to participate in such a Performance Award, but the Participant does not terminate employment or service with the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, the         Committee may, in its sole discretion: (a) cause shares of Common Stock to be delivered or payment made with respect to the Participant's Performance Award in accordance with Section 9.7 of this Plan, but only if otherwise earned for the entire         Performance Period or (b) cause shares of Common Stock to be delivered or payment made with respect to the Participant's Performance Award in accordance with Section 9.7 of this Plan, but only if otherwise earned for the entire Performance Period         and only with respect to the portion of the applicable Performance Period completed at the date of such reassignment, with proration based on the number of months or years such Participant served in the prior position during the Performance Period.
9.6          Committee Discretion to Scale Back Awards.  At any time during a Performance Period of more than one fiscal year, the Committee may, in its discretion, cancel a portion of a Performance         Award prior to the conclusion of the Performance Period (a "Scale Back"), provided that:
(a)           the         Performance Award has not yet vested;
(b)          based         on financial information contained in the financial statements or similar internal reports of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, the Committee determines that the Performance Goals for the Performance Period cannot be achieved at         the maximum levels established at the time of grant;
(c)          once a         Performance Award is Scaled Back, it may not again be increased to add or recover a Performance Award that was canceled; and
(d)          Performance             Awards canceled in a Scale Back will again be available to the Committee for grant of new Performance Awards for any future Performance Period.  This provision will not be used in any manner that could have the effect of repricing a previous         Performance Award. 9.7          Form and Timing of Performance Award Payment.  Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Awards will be entitled to         receive payment on the value and number of Performance Awards earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding Performance Goals have been achieved. Payment of earned         Performance Awards will be as determined by the Committee and as evidenced in the Award Agreement.  Subject to the terms of this Plan, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Awards in the form of cash, in shares of Common         Stock or other Awards (or in a combination thereof) equal to the value of the earned Performance Awards at the close of the applicable Performance Period. Payment of any Performance Award will be made as soon as practicable after the Committee has         determined the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved and not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month immediately following the later of the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the Performance Period ends and any additional vesting restrictions are         satisfied or the end of the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends and any additional vesting restrictions are satisfied, except to the extent that a Participant has properly elected to defer payment that may be attributable to a         Performance Award under a Company deferred compensation plan or arrangement.  The determination of the Committee with respect to the form and time of payment of Performance Awards will be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of         the Performance Award.  Any shares of Common Stock or other Awards issued in payment of earned Performance Awards may be granted subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee, including that the Participant remain in the         continuous employment or service with the Company or a Subsidiary for a certain period.
9.8          Dividend Rights.  Participants holding Performance Awards granted under this Plan may receive cash dividends or Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends declared on shares of Common         Stock that are subject to such Performance Awards during the period between the date that such Performance Awards are granted and the date such Performance Awards are settled; provided, however, that such cash dividends or Dividend Equivalents may         not be paid out until the vesting provisions of such Performance Award lapse.

[END TABLE]
10.1          Grant.  Subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, the Committee, at any time         and from time to time, may grant to Eligible Recipients Awards denominated in cash in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee may determine, based on the achievement of specified Performance Goals for annual periods or other time periods         as determined by the Committee (the "Annual Performance Cash Awards").
10.2          Target Payout.  The target amount that may be paid with respect to an Annual Performance Cash Award (the "Target             Payout") may be determined by the Committee pursuant to Section 13.2 of this Plan and may be based on a percentage of a Participant's actual annual base compensation at the time of grant ("Participation Factor"), within the range established by the Committee for each Participant and subject to adjustment as provided in the second to last sentence of this Section 10.2.  The Chief Executive         Officer may approve modifications to the Participation Factor for any Participant, if such modification is based on level of responsibility.  The Committee may establish curves, matrices or other measurements for prorating the amount of payments         for achievement of Performance Goals at less or greater than the Target Payout.
10.3          Maximum Payout. The Committee also may establish a maximum potential payout amount (the "Maximum Payout")             with respect to an Annual Performance Cash Award in the event Performance Goals are exceeded by an amount established by the Committee at the time Performance Goals are established.  The Committee may establish curves, matrices or other         measurements for prorating the amount of payments for achievement of Performance Goals at greater than the Target Payout but less than the Maximum Payout. 10.4          Individual Performance Goals.  At the time an Annual Performance Cash Award is granted, the Committee may provide for an increase in the Target Payout and the Maximum Payout (as either         may be prorated in accordance with Sections 10.2 and 10.3 of this Plan) for selected Participants ("Individual Performance Participants") to reflect the achievement         of individual performance goals ("Individual Performance Goals") established at that time by the Committee.  The Committee will have the discretion to reduce by an         amount up to 100% the amount that would otherwise be paid under the payout formula to an Individual Performance Participant based on the Committee's evaluation of the individual's achievement of the Individual Performance Goals.
10.5          Payment.  Payment of any earned Annual Performance Cash Awards will be made as soon as possible after the Committee has determined the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals and         Individual Performance Goals have been achieved and not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the third (3rd) month immediately following the later of the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the Performance Period ends or the end of the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends, except to the extent that a         Participant has properly elected to defer payment that may be attributable to an Annual Performance Cash Award under a Company deferred compensation plan or arrangement.

[END TABLE]
11.1          Automatic and Non-Discretionary Awards to Non-Employee Directors.  Subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, the Committee at any time and         from time to time may approve resolutions providing for the automatic grant to Non-Employee Directors of Non-Employee Director Awards granted under this Plan and may grant to Non-Employee Directors such discretionary Non-Employee Director Awards on         such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and set forth in an applicable Award Agreement. Such Non-Employee Director Awards will not be subject to         management's discretion.
11.2         Deferral of Award Payment; Election to Receive Award in Lieu of Retainers.  The Committee may permit Non-Employee Directors the opportunity to defer the payment of an         Award pursuant to such terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe from time to time.

[END TABLE]
12.1        Other Cash-Based Awards.  Subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of this Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole         discretion, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Other Cash-Based Awards to Eligible Recipients not otherwise described by the terms of this Plan in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee may determine. 12.2        Other Stock-Based Awards.

Such Awards may involve the transfer of actual shares of Common Stock to Participants as a bonus or in lieu of obligations to pay cash or deliver other property under this Plan or under other plans or         compensatory arrangements, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Common Stock, and may include Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United         States.
12.3          Value of Other Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.  Each Other Cash-Based Award will specify a payment amount or payment range as determined by the Committee.  Each Other         Stock-Based Award will be expressed in terms of shares of Common Stock or units based on shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Committee.  The Committee may establish Performance Goals in its discretion for any Other Cash-Based Award or any         Other Stock-Based Award.  If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish Performance Goals for any such Awards, the number or value of Other Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant will depend         on the extent to which the Performance Goals are met.
12.4        Payment of Other Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.  Payment, if any, with respect to an Other Cash-Based Award or an Other Stock-Based Award will be made in accordance with         the terms of the Award, in cash for any Other Cash-Based Award and in cash or shares of Common Stock for any Other Stock-Based Award, as the Committee determines, except to the extent that a Participant has properly elected to defer payment that         may be attributable to an Other Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award under a Company deferred compensation plan or arrangement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Performance-Based Compensation.  
[END TABLE]
13.1          Performance Measures.  The Performance Goals may include one or more specified objective Performance Measures that are based on any of the following Performance Measure elements as         determined by the Committee (each, a "Performance Measure Element"): sales and revenue measures: gross revenue, sales allowances, net revenue, invoiced revenue,         collected revenue, revenues from new products, bad debts, home closings, orders, backlog, annual or multi-year "net-back" sales"; expense measures: direct material costs, direct labor costs, indirect labor costs, direct manufacturing costs,         indirect manufacturing costs, cost of goods sold, sales, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, non-cash expenses, tax expense, non-operating expenses, total expenses; profitability and productivity measures: gross margin, net         operating income, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), net operating income after taxes (NOPAT), net income, net income before taxes, net cash flow, net cash flow from         operations, maintenance or improvement of profit margins; asset utilization and effectiveness measures: cash, excess cash, accounts receivable, inventory (WIP or finished goods), inventory days on hand, days sales outstanding, current assets,         working capital, total capital, fixed assets, total assets, change in net assets, standard hours, plant utilization, purchase price variance, manufacturing overhead variance; debt and equity measures: accounts payable, current accrued liabilities,         total current liabilities, total debt, debt principal payments, net current borrowings, total long-term debt, credit rating, retained earnings, total preferred equity, total common equity, total equity, cash-to-debt, interest coverage, liquidity;         stockholder and return measures: earnings per share (diluted and fully diluted), stock price, dividends, shares repurchased, total return to stockholders, price/earnings ratio, market capitalization, book value, debt coverage ratios, return on         assets, return on equity, return on invested capital, economic profit (for example, economic value added); customer and market measures: customer satisfaction, customer retention, customer service/care, brand awareness and perception, market share,         warranty rates, product quality, inventory, strategic business objectives, introduction of new products, procurement of land/well located lots, mortgage capture rates, acquisition/entrance into new markets, land and other asset acquisitions,         strategic asset sales or acquisitions, improvements in capital structure; organizational and employee measures: headcount, employee performance, employee productivity, standard hours, employee engagement/satisfaction, employee turnover, employee         diversity, safety, satisfactory completion of major project or organizational initiative, supervision of litigation. Any Performance Measure Element can be a Performance Measure.  In addition, any of the Performance Measure Element(s) can be used         in an algebraic formula (e.g., averaged over a period, combined into a ratio, compared to a budget or standard, compared to previous periods or other         formulaic combinations) based on the Performance Measure Elements to create a Performance Measure. Any Performance Measure(s) may be used to measure the performance of the Company or Subsidiary as a whole or any division or business unit of the         Company, product or product group, region or territory, or Subsidiary, or any combination thereof, as the Committee may deem appropriate.  Any Performance Measure(s) can be compared to the performance of a peer group or published or special index         that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, or the Company may select any Performance Measure(s) above as compared to various stock market indices.  The Committee also has the authority to provide for accelerated vesting of any         Award based on the achievement of Performance Goals pursuant to any Performance Measure(s) specified in this Section 13.1. 13.2          Establishment of Performance Goals.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation will be granted, and Performance         Goals for such an Award will be established, by the Committee in writing not later than ninety (90) days after the commencement of the Performance Period to which the Performance Goals relate; provided, however, that the outcome is substantially uncertain at the time the Committee establishes the Performance Goal; and provided further that in no event will a Performance Goal be considered to be         pre-established if it is established after twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period (as scheduled in good faith at the time the Performance Goal is established) has elapsed.
13.3          Certification of Payment.  Before any payment is made in connection with any Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee must certify in writing, as         reflected in the minutes, that the Performance Goals established with respect to such Award have been achieved.
13.4          Evaluation of Performance.  The Committee may provide in any such Award Agreement including Performance Goals, or in applicable resolutions, that any evaluation of performance may include         or exclude any event that occurs during a Performance Period as determined appropriate by the Committee, including: (a) items related to a change in accounting principles; (b) items relating to financing activities; (c) expenses for restructuring         or productivity initiatives; (d) other non-operating items; (e) items related to acquisitions; (f) items attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by the Company during the Performance Period; (g) items related to the disposal         of a business or segment of a business; (h) items related to discontinued operations that do not qualify as a segment of a business under applicable accounting standards; (i) items attributable to any stock dividend, stock split, combination or         exchange of stock occurring during the Performance Period; (j) any other items of significant income or expense which are determined to be appropriate adjustments; (k) items relating to unusual or extraordinary corporate transactions, events or         developments; (l) items related to amortization of acquired intangible assets; (m) items that are outside the scope of the Company's core, on-going business activities; (n) items related to acquired in-process research and development; (o) items         relating to changes in tax laws; (p) items relating to major licensing or partnership arrangements; (q) items relating to asset impairment charges; (r) items relating to gains or losses for litigation, arbitration and contractual settlements; (s)         foreign exchange gains and losses; or (t) items relating to any other unusual or nonrecurring events or changes in applicable laws, accounting principles or business conditions. 13.5          Adjustment of Performance Goals, Performance Periods or other Vesting Criteria.  Subject to Section 13.6 of this Plan, the Committee may amend or modify the vesting criteria (including         any Performance Goals, Performance Measures or Performance Periods) of any outstanding Awards based in whole or in part on the financial performance of the Company (or any Subsidiary or division, business unit or other sub-unit thereof) in         recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including the events described in Sections 13.4 or 4.5(a) of this Plan) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting         principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan.  The determination of         the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, will be final, conclusive and binding on Participants under this Plan.
13.6          Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation.  The Committee retains the discretion to adjust Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation either upward or         downward, either on a formula or discretionary basis or any combination, as the Committee determines.
13.7          Committee Discretion.  In the event that applicable tax or securities laws change to permit Committee discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining stockholder         approval of such changes, the Committee will have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining stockholder approval.  In addition, the Committee may grant Performance Awards based on Performance Measures other than those set forth in         Section 13.1 of this Plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  Dividend Equivalents.  
[END TABLE]
Subject to the provisions of this Plan and any Award Agreement, any Participant selected by the Committee may be granted Dividend Equivalents       based on the dividends declared on shares of Common Stock that are subject to any Award (including any Award that has been deferred), to be credited as of dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date       the Award is exercised, vests, settles, is paid or expires, as determined by the Committee. Such Dividend Equivalents will be converted to cash or additional shares of Common Stock by such formula and at such time and subject to such limitations as       may be determined by the Committee and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) will be deemed to have been reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock or otherwise reinvested.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not       grant Dividend Equivalents based on the dividends declared on shares of Common Stock that are subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right; and further, no dividend or Dividend Equivalents will be paid out with respect to any unvested Awards.

The Committee will consider the         provisions of Section 15.5 of this Plan and will have the discretion to consider any other fact or circumstance in making its decision as to whether to deliver such shares of Common Stock or other payment, including whether the Participant again         becomes employed; and

15.4          Modification of Rights upon Termination.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 15, upon a Participant's termination of employment or other service with the Company or any         Subsidiary, as the case may be, the Committee may, in its sole discretion (which may be exercised at any time on or after the Grant Date, including following such termination) cause Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (or any part thereof) held by         such Participant as of the effective date of such termination to terminate, become or continue to become exercisable or remain exercisable following such termination of employment or service, and Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Deferred         Stock Units, Performance Awards, Annual Performance Cash Awards, Non-Employee Director Awards, Other Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards held by such Participant as of the effective date of such termination to terminate, vest or become         free of restrictions and conditions to payment, as the case may be, following such termination of employment or service, in each case in the manner determined by the Committee; provided,         however, that (a) no Option or Stock Appreciation Right may remain exercisable beyond its expiration date; (b) the Committee may not take any action not permitted         pursuant to Section 13.6 of this Plan; and (c) any such action by the Committee adversely affecting any outstanding Award will not be effective without the consent of the affected Participant (subject to the right of the Committee to take whatever         action it deems appropriate under Section 4.5, 15.5, 17 or 21 of this Plan). 15.5          Additional Forfeiture Events.
(a)          Effect of Actions Constituting Cause or Adverse Action.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary and in addition to the other rights of the Committee under         this Plan, including this Section 15.5, if a Participant is determined by the Committee, acting in its sole discretion, to have taken any action that would constitute Cause or an Adverse Action during or after the termination of employment or other         service with the Company or a Subsidiary, irrespective of whether such action or the Committee's determination occurs before or after termination of such Participant's employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary and irrespective         of whether or not the Participant was terminated as a result of such Cause or Adverse Action, (i) all rights of the Participant under this Plan and any Award Agreements evidencing an Award then held by the Participant will terminate and be         forfeited without notice of any kind, and (ii) the Committee in its sole discretion will have the authority to rescind the exercise, vesting or issuance of, or payment in respect of, any Awards of the Participant that were exercised, vested or         issued, or as to which such payment was made, and to require the Participant to pay to the Company, within ten (10) days of receipt from the Company of notice of such rescission, any amount received or the amount of any gain realized as a result of         such rescinded exercise, vesting, issuance or payment (including any dividends paid or other distributions made with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to any Award).  The Company may defer the exercise of any Option or Stock         Appreciation Right for a period of up to six (6) months after receipt of the Participant's written notice of exercise or the issuance of share certificates upon the vesting of any Award for a period of up to six (6) months after the date of such         vesting in order for the Committee to make any determination as to the existence of Cause or an Adverse Action.  The Company will be entitled to withhold and deduct from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and         owing to the Participant from the Company or a Subsidiary) or make other arrangements for the collection of all amounts necessary to satisfy such payment obligations.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an applicable Award Agreement,         this Section 15.5(a) will not apply to any Participant following a Change in Control.
(b)          Forfeiture or Clawback of Awards Under Applicable Law and Company Policy.  If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material         noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then any Participant who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley         Act of 2002 will reimburse the Company for the amount of any Award received by such individual under this Plan during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be,         of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. The Company also may seek to recover any Award made as required by the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any other clawback,         forfeiture or recoupment provision required by Applicable Law or under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which the shares of Common Stock are then listed or traded. In addition, all Awards under this Plan will be subject to         forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to any clawback or forfeiture policy of the Company, as in effect from time to time (including, but not limited to, the Company's Clawback and Forfeiture Policy as adopted in 2018), and such forfeiture and/or         penalty conditions or provisions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.

16.  Payment of Withholding Taxes.  
[END TABLE]
16.1          General Rules.  The Company is entitled to (a) withhold and deduct from future wages of the Participant (or from other amounts that may be due and owing to the Participant from the         Company or a Subsidiary), or make other arrangements for the collection of, all legally required amounts necessary to satisfy any and all federal, foreign, state and local withholding and employment related tax requirements attributable to an         Award, including the grant, exercise, vesting or settlement of, or payment of dividends with respect to, an Award or a disqualifying disposition of stock received upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option, or (b) require the Participant promptly         to remit the amount of such withholding to the Company before taking any action, including issuing any shares of Common Stock, with respect to an Award.  When withholding shares of Common Stock for taxes is effected under this Plan, it will be         withheld only up to an amount based on the maximum statutory tax rates in the Participant's applicable tax jurisdiction or such other rate that will not trigger a negative accounting impact on the Company.
16.2          Special Rules.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion and upon terms and conditions established by the Committee, permit or require a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, any         withholding or employment related tax obligation described in Section 16.1 of this Plan by withholding shares of Common Stock underlying an Award, by electing to tender, or by attestation as to ownership of, Previously Acquired Shares, by delivery         of a Broker Exercise Notice or a combination of such methods.  For purposes of satisfying a Participant's withholding or employment-related tax obligation, shares of Common Stock withheld by the Company or Previously Acquired Shares tendered or         covered by an attestation will be valued at their Fair Market Value on the Tax Date.

[END TABLE]
17.1          Definition of Change in Control.  Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or Individual Agreement between the Participant and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates,         a "Change in Control" will mean the occurrence of any of the following:
(a)          The         acquisition, other than from the Company, by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of         fifty percent (50%) or more of either the then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, but         excluding, for this purpose, any such acquisition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any entity with respect to which, following such acquisition, more         than fifty percent (50%) of, respectively, the then outstanding equity of such entity and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting equity of such entity entitled to vote generally in the election of all or substantially all of the         members of such entity's governing body is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners, respectively, of the Common Stock and voting securities of the Company immediately prior to         such acquisition in substantially the same proportion as their ownership, immediately prior to such acquisition, of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of         the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be; or
(b)          The         consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company, in each case, with respect to which all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the respective beneficial owners of the Common Stock and voting         securities of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, following such reorganization, merger or consolidation, beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent (50%)  of, respectively,         the then outstanding shares of Common Stock and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the corporation resulting from such reorganization,         merger or consolidation; or (c)          a         complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.
17.2          Continuation, Assumption or Substitution of Outstanding Awards; Treatment Upon Subsequent Termination. In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving or successor organization (or a         parent or subsidiary thereof) (the "Successor") may continue, assume or substitute equivalent awards (with such adjustments as may be required or permitted by         Section 4.5 of this Plan). The Successor may elect to continue, assume or substitute only some Awards or portions of Awards. A substitute equivalent award must (i) have a value at least equal to the value of the Award being substituted; (ii) relate         to a publicly-traded equity security of the Successor involved in the Change in Control or another entity that is affiliated with the Company or the Successor following the Change in Control; (iii) be the same type of award as the Award being         substituted; (iv) be vested to the extent vested at the time of and as a result of the Change in Control and (v) have other terms and conditions (including vesting, exercisability and effect of termination within two (2) years following a Change in         Control) that are not less favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Award being substituted, in each case, as determined by the Committee (as constituted prior to the Change in Control) in its sole discretion. If an Award         is continued, assumed or substituted by the Successor and within two (2) years following a Change in Control the Participant (i) is terminated by the Successor (or an Affiliate thereof) without Cause or (ii) if the Participant is an executive         officer of the Company (who is subject to reporting under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) or was an executive officer of the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control and resigns for Good Reason, the following rules will apply to the         continued, assumed or substituted Awards, unless otherwise specifically provided in the applicable Award Agreement:
(a)          Any         and all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will vest and become immediately exercisable as of the termination or resignation and will remain exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of its full specified term or the first anniversary of         the date of such termination or resignation.
(b)          All         restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Units that are not performance-based will lapse. Such Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units will be settled and paid in cash or shares of Common Stock as         provided in the Award Agreement. If such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units will be paid within thirty (30) days following         the termination or resignation. If such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then the Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units will be paid within the thirty (30) day         period following the Participant's separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) (a "Separation from Service"); provided, however, that if at the time of the Participant's Separation from Service, such Participant         is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), then payment will be suspended, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, until the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months after the date         of the Participant's Separation from Service or (ii) the Participant's death. (c)          All         vested and earned Awards that are performance-based for which the Performance Period has been completed as of the date of such termination or resignation but have not yet been paid will be paid in cash or Shares and at such time as provided in the         Award Agreement. All performance-based Awards for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the date of such termination or resignation will immediately vest and be earned in full, and paid out with respect to each Performance Goal         based on actual performance achieved through the date of such termination or resignation with the manner of payment to be made in cash or Shares as provided in the Award Agreement within thirty (30) days following the date of such termination or         resignation. If such Awards are subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then the Awards will be paid within the thirty (30) day period following the Participant's Separation from Service; provided, however, that if at such time, such Participant is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section         409A), then payment will be suspended, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, until to the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the Participant's         death.
17.3          No Continuation, Assumption or Substitution of Outstanding Awards; Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of a Change in Control, any outstanding Awards that are not continued, assumed         or substituted with equivalent awards by the Successor pursuant to Section 17.2 of this Plan, or in the case of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all Awards, will be subject to the following rules, in each case effective immediately         prior to such Change in Control but conditioned upon the completion of such Change in Control:
(a)          Any         Options and Stock Appreciation Rights will be fully vested and exercisable and the Committee will either (1) give a Participant a reasonable opportunity to exercise the Option and Stock Appreciation Right before the transaction resulting in the         Change in Control (including cashless exercise by a Participant) or (2) pay the Participant the difference between the exercise price for such Option or the grant price for such Stock Appreciation Right and the per Share consideration provided to         other similarly situated stockholders in such Change in Control; provided, however,         that if the exercise price of such Option or the grant price of such Stock Appreciation Right exceeds the aforementioned consideration provided, then the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be canceled and terminated without any payment. In         either case, such Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be cancelled. The Committee will not be obligated to treat all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights subject to this Section 17.3 in the same manner. The exercise of any Option or Stock         Appreciation Right whose exercisability is accelerated as provided in this Section 17.3 will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Change in Control and will be effective only immediately before such consummation.
(b)          All         restrictions imposed on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units that are not performance-based will lapse. Such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units will be settled and paid in cash or shares of Common Stock as         provided in the Award Agreement. If Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then the Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units will be paid within thirty (30) days following         the Change in Control. If Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, then the time of payment will depend on whether the Change in Control is a distribution event under Treasury         Regulation § 1.409A-3(a)(5) (a "409A Change in Control"). If the Change in Control is a 409A Change in Control, then the Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock         Units subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code will be paid within the thirty (30) day period following the Change in Control. If the Change in Control is not a 409A Change in Control, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units         subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code will be paid as of the earlier of the time specified in the Award Agreement or within the thirty (30) day period following the date the Participant has a Separation from Service following such         Change in Control; provided, however, that if at the time of the Participant's         Separation from Service, such Participant is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), then payment will be suspended, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, until the first business day after the earlier of (i) the         date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's Separation from Service or (ii) the Participant's death. (c)          All         vested and earned Awards that are performance-based for which the Performance Period has been completed as of the date of the Change in Control but have not yet been paid will be paid in cash or Shares and at such time as provided in the Award         Agreement. All performance-based Awards for which the Performance Period has not been completed as of the date of the Change in Control will immediately vest and be earned in full, and paid out with respect to each Performance Goal based on actual         performance achieved through the date of such Change in Control with the manner of payment to be made in cash or Shares as provided in the Award Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change in Control, but no later than within         thirty (30) days following the date of the Change in Control; provided, however         that if any such payment is to be made in Shares, the Committee may in its discretion, provide such holders the consideration provided to other similarly situated shareholders in such Change in Control.
17.4          Alternative Special Treatment of Performance-Based Awards. Notwithstanding Section 17.2 and 17.3 above, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee, may decide in its discretion         that, in lieu of treatment under Section 17.2 or 17.3 above, with respect to any outstanding Performance Awards, (i) the Performance Period will end as of the date immediately prior to such Change in Control and the Committee will determine the         extent to which the Performance Goals applicable to such Performance Award have been satisfied at such time, (ii) the portion of such Performance Award that is deemed to have been earned pursuant to clause (i) above will be converted into a         time-vesting Award of equivalent value to which any service vesting requirements applicable to the predecessor Performance Award will continue to apply and (iii) the converted time-vesting Award will be paid or settled on the settlement date or         dates as provided under the terms of the predecessor Performance Award that would have applied had a Change in Control not occurred; provided however, that if within two (2) years following a Change in Control the Participant (i) is terminated by the Successor (or an Affiliate thereof) without Cause or (ii) if         the Participant is an executive officer of the Company (who is subject to reporting under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) or was an executive officer of the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control and resigns for Good Reason, any service         vesting requirements applicable to any such converted Award will be deemed to have been met and such converted Award will be immediately paid or settled upon such termination. The Committee will not be obligated to treat all Performance Awards         subject to this Section 17.4 in the same manner.
17.5          Limitation on Change in Control Payments.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 17 to the contrary, if, with respect to a Participant, the acceleration of the vesting of an Award or         the payment of cash in exchange for all or part of a Stock-Based Award (which acceleration or payment could be deemed a "payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), together with any other "payments" that such Participant has         the right to receive from the Company or any corporation that is a member of an "affiliated group" (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code without regard to Section 1504(b) of the Code) of which the Company is a member, would constitute a         "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), then the "payments" to such Participant pursuant to Section 17.2 of this Plan will be reduced (or acceleration of vesting eliminated) to the largest amount as will result in no         portion of such "payments" being subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code; provided, however, that such reduction will be made only if the aggregate amount of the payments after such reduction exceeds the difference between (a) the amount of such payments absent such reduction minus (b) the aggregate         amount of the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code attributable to any such excess parachute payments; and provided, further that such payments will be reduced (or acceleration of vesting eliminated) by first reducing or eliminating payments or benefits the full value of which are required to be recognized as         contingent upon a Change in Control (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation § 1.280G-1, Q/A-24), followed by reducing or eliminating payments or benefits which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in         each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if a Participant is subject to a separate agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary         that expressly addresses the potential application of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code, then this Section 17.5 will not apply and any "payments" to a Participant pursuant to Section 17 of this Plan will be treated as "payments" arising under such         separate agreement; provided, however, such separate agreement may not modify         the time or form of payment under any Award that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code if the modification would cause such Award to become subject to the adverse tax consequences specified in Section 409A of the         Code. 17.6          Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 17 to the contrary, individual Award Agreements or Individual Agreements between a Participant and the Company or one of its         Subsidiaries or Affiliates may contain provisions with respect to vesting, payment or treatment of Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, and the terms of any such Award Agreement or Individual Agreement will govern to the extent of any         inconsistency with the terms of this Section 17. The Committee will not be obligated to treat all Awards subject to this Section 17 in the same manner. The timing of any payment under this Section 17 may be governed by any election to defer receipt         of a payment made under a Company deferred compensation plan or arrangement.

18.  Rights of Eligible Recipients and Participants; Transferability.  
[END TABLE]
18.1          Employment.  Nothing in this Plan or an Award Agreement will interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of any         Eligible Recipient or Participant at any time, nor confer upon any Eligible Recipient or Participant any right to continue employment or other service with the Company or any Subsidiary.
18.2          No Rights to Awards. No Participant or Eligible Recipient will have any claim to be granted any Award under this Plan.
18.3          Rights as a Stockholder.  Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, a Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by any         Stock-Based Award unless and until the Participant becomes the holder of record of such shares of Common Stock and then subject to any restrictions or limitations as provided herein or in the Award Agreement.
18.4          Restrictions on Transfer.
(a)          Except         pursuant to testamentary will or the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise expressly permitted by subsections (b) and (c) below, no right or interest of any Participant in an Award prior to the exercise (in the case of Options or Stock         Appreciation Rights) or vesting, issuance or settlement of such Award will be assignable or transferable, or subjected to any lien, during the lifetime of the Participant, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, by operation of         law or otherwise. (b)          A         Participant will be entitled to designate a beneficiary to receive an Award upon such Participant's death, and in the event of such Participant's death, payment of any amounts due under this Plan will be made to, and exercise of any Options or         Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 15 of this Plan) may be made by, such beneficiary.  If a deceased Participant has failed to designate a beneficiary, or if a beneficiary designated by the Participant fails to         survive the Participant, payment of any amounts due under this Plan will be made to, and exercise of any Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 15 of this Plan) may be made by, the Participant's legal         representatives, heirs and legatees.  If a deceased Participant has designated a beneficiary and such beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before complete payment of all amounts due under this Plan or exercise of all exercisable Options or         Stock Appreciation Rights, then such payments will be made to, and the exercise of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be made by, the legal representatives, heirs and legatees of the beneficiary.
(c)          Upon a         Participant's request, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a transfer of all or a portion of a Non-Statutory Stock Option, other than for value, to such Participant's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent,         spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, any person sharing such Participant's household (other than a tenant or employee), a trust in which any of         the foregoing have more than fifty percent (50%) of the beneficial interests, a foundation in which any of the foregoing (or the Participant) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the Participant) own         more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interests.  Any permitted transferee will remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Participant prior to the transfer.  A permitted transfer may be conditioned upon such         requirements as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine, including execution or delivery of appropriate acknowledgements, opinion of counsel, or other documents by the transferee.
(d)          The         Committee may impose such restrictions on any shares of Common Stock acquired by a Participant under this Plan as it may deem advisable, including minimum holding period requirements in addition to those under Section 4.8 of this Plan, restrictions         under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, or under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such shares or the Company's insider         trading policy.
18.5          Non-Exclusivity of this Plan.  Nothing contained in this Plan is intended to modify or rescind any previously approved compensation plans or programs of the Company or create any         limitations on the power or authority of the Board to adopt such additional or other compensation arrangements as the Board may deem necessary or desirable.
[BEGIN TABLE]
19.  Securities Law and Other Restrictions.  
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreements entered into pursuant to this Plan, the Company will not be required to       issue any shares of Common Stock under this Plan, and a Participant may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan, unless (a) there is in effect with respect to such       shares a registration statement under the Securities Act and any applicable securities laws of a state or foreign jurisdiction or an exemption from such registration under the Securities Act and applicable state or foreign securities laws, and (b)       there has been obtained any other consent, approval or permit from any other U.S. or foreign regulatory body which the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable. The Company may condition such issuance, sale or transfer upon the       receipt of any representations or agreements from the parties involved, and the placement of any legends on certificates representing shares of Common Stock, as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the Company in order to comply with such       securities law or other restrictions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
20.  Deferred Compensation; Compliance with Section 409A.  
[END TABLE]
It is intended that all Awards issued under this Plan be in a form and administered in a manner that will comply with the requirements of       Section 409A of the Code, or the requirements of an exception to Section 409A of the Code, and the Award Agreements and this Plan will be construed and administered in a manner that is consistent with and gives effect to such intent.  The Committee       is authorized to adopt rules or regulations deemed necessary or appropriate to qualify for an exception from or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.  With respect to an Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject       to Code Section 409A: (a) if any amount is payable under such Award upon a termination of service, a termination of service will be treated as having occurred only at such time the Participant has experienced a Separation from Service; (b) if any       amount is payable under such Award upon a Disability, a Disability will be treated as having occurred only at such time the Participant has experienced a "disability" as such term is defined for purposes of Code Section 409A; (c) if any amount is       payable under such Award on account of the occurrence of a Change in Control, a Change in Control will be treated as having occurred only at such time a "change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation or in the ownership of a       substantial portion of the assets of the corporation" as such terms are defined for purposes of Code Section 409A, (d) if any amount becomes payable under such Award on account of a Participant's Separation from Service at such time as the       Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then no payment will be made, except as permitted under Code Section 409A, prior to the first business day after the earlier of (i) the date that is six months after the       date of the Participant's Separation from Service or (ii) the Participant's death, and (e) no amendment to or payment under such Award will be made except and only to the extent permitted under Code Section 409A.
[BEGIN TABLE]
21.  Amendment, Modification and Termination.  
[END TABLE]
21.1          Generally.  Subject to other subsections of this Section 21 and Sections 3.4 and 21.3 of this Plan, the Board at any time may suspend or terminate this Plan (or any portion thereof) or         terminate any outstanding Award Agreement and the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may amend this Plan or amend or modify the terms of an outstanding Award.  The Committee's power and authority to amend or modify the terms of an         outstanding Award includes the authority to modify the number of shares of Common Stock or other terms and conditions of an Award, extend the term of an Award, accept the surrender of any outstanding Award or, to the extent not previously exercised         or vested, authorize the grant of new Awards in substitution for surrendered Awards; provided, however         that the amended or modified terms are permitted by this Plan as then in effect, including without limitation Section 3.4 of this Plan and that any Participant adversely affected by such amended or modified terms has consented to such amendment or         modification.
21.2          Stockholder Approval.  No amendments to this Plan will be effective without approval of the Company's stockholders if: (a) stockholder approval of the amendment is then required pursuant         to Section 422 of the Code, the rules of the primary stock exchange or stock market on which the Common Stock is then traded, applicable state corporate laws or regulations, applicable federal laws or regulations, and the applicable laws of any         foreign country or jurisdiction where Awards are, or will be, granted under this Plan; or (b) such amendment would: (i) modify Section 3.4 of this Plan; (ii) materially increase benefits accruing to Participants; (iii) increase the aggregate number         of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable under this Plan; (iv) increase any limitation set forth in this Plan on the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued or the aggregate value of Awards which may be made, in respect of any type         of Award to any single Participant during any specified period; (v) modify the eligibility requirements for Participants in this Plan; or (vi) reduce the minimum exercise price or grant price as set forth in Sections 6.3 and 7.3 of this Plan. 21.3          Awards Previously Granted.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, no termination, suspension or amendment of this Plan may adversely affect any outstanding         Award without the consent of the affected Participant; provided, however, that         this sentence will not impair the right of the Committee to take whatever action it deems appropriate under Sections 3.4, 4.5, 13.5, 15, 17, 20 or 21.4 of this Plan.
21.4          Amendments to Conform to Law.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Committee may amend this Plan or an Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or         otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming this Plan or an Award Agreement to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature, and to the administrative regulations and rulings promulgated         thereunder.  By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any amendment made pursuant to this Section 21.4 to any Award granted under this Plan without further consideration or action.
[BEGIN TABLE]
22.  Substituted Awards.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee may grant Awards under this Plan in substitution for stock and stock-based awards held by employees of another entity who become       employees of the Company or a Subsidiary as a result of a merger or consolidation of the former employing entity with the Company or a Subsidiary or the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or stock of the former employing       corporation. The Committee may direct that the substitute Awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.
[BEGIN TABLE]
23.  Effective Date and Duration of this Plan.  
[END TABLE]
This Plan is effective as of the Effective Date.  This Plan will terminate at midnight on the day before the ten (10) year anniversary of the       Effective Date, and may be terminated prior to such time by Board action.  No Award will be granted after termination of this Plan, but Awards outstanding upon termination of this Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms       and conditions and the terms and conditions of this Plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
24.  Miscellaneous.  
[END TABLE]
24.1          Usage.  In this Plan, except where otherwise indicated by clear contrary intention, (a) any masculine term used herein also will include the feminine, (b) the plural will include the         singular, and the singular will include the plural, (c) "including" (and with correlative meaning "include") means including without limiting the generality of any description preceding such term, and (d) "or" is used in the inclusive sense of         "and/or".
24.2          Unfunded Plan.  Participants will have no right, title or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company or its Subsidiaries may make to aid it in meeting its obligations         under this Plan.  Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal         representative, or any other individual.  To the extent that any individual acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Subsidiary under this Plan, such right will be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of         the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be.  All payments to be made hereunder will be paid from the general funds of the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be, and no special or separate fund will be established and no segregation         of assets will be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in this Plan. 24.3          Relationship to Other Benefits.
