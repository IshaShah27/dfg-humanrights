Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 29, 2019 
March 18, 2019 
Dear Shareholders: 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I invite you to attend GATX Corporation's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Monday, April 29, 2019, at 12:00 p.m. Central Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 233 South Wacker Drive, 52nd Floor, Chicago, Illinois. Enclosed you will find a notice setting forth the items we expect to address at the meeting, our proxy statement, a form of proxy, and a copy of our 2018 annual report to our shareholders. 
Our financial results in 2018 were significantly better than we originally anticipated. Capitalizing on an improved railcar leasing environment in North America, we realized higher fleet utilization, a higher renewal success rate, and higher lease renewal rates versus our original expectations. Maintenance expense was also lower than anticipated in 2018 due to fewer repairs performed by railroads as well as fewer tank qualifications. While we saw broad increases in market lease rates in 2018, revenue was still pressured as new lease rates remained below rates on expiring leases. 
We executed on our strategy to invest aggressively in cost-advantaged railcars. In 2018, we entered into two long-term railcar supply agreements and invested more than $730 million in our North American fleet, including the acquisition of a competitor's portfolio of approximately 3,100 railcars. We also continued to capitalize on strong North American secondary market demand by optimizing the fleet through railcar sales, generating significant remarketing income. In addition, our international railcar leasing business outperformed our expectations and achieved record high fleet utilization, while our American Steamship subsidiary significantly increased its profitability by operating its fleet more efficiently and capitalizing on late season demand opportunities. Lastly, our aircraft spare engine leasing joint ventures with Rolls-Royce produced another year of strong financial results. 
Our outstanding operating performance during the year yielded excellent financial results as GATX: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• produced diluted earnings per share of $5.52 ($5.22 excluding tax adjustments and other items)1  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• earned return on equity of 11.8% (13.6% excluding tax adjustments and other items)1  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• returned more than $184 million to our shareholders through payment of dividends and share repurchases   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• invested over $900 million in our businesses around the globe.  
[END TABLE]
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend in person, please ensure that your shares are represented at the meeting by promptly voting and submitting your proxy by internet or telephone, or by signing and returning your proxy card in the enclosed envelope. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors and management, I would like to thank you for your continued support of GATX. We hope you will be able to attend the meeting and look forward to seeing you there.

PROXY SUMMARY 
2018 PERFORMANCE AND KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Our financial results in 2018 were significantly better than we originally anticipated. Capitalizing on an improved railcar leasing environment in North America, we realized higher fleet utilization, a higher renewal success rate, and higher lease renewal rates versus our original expectations. We executed on our strategy to invest aggressively in cost-advantaged railcars, signing two long-term supply agreements for a total of over 12,450 railcars to be delivered through 2023 and acquiring a competitor's portfolio of approximately 3,100 railcars. We also capitalized on strong North American secondary market demand by optimizing the fleet through railcar sales, generating significant remarketing income. We continue to execute our strategy through all points in the business cycle and deliver against key metrics we use in our compensation plans. The table below shows our financial and operational performance over the past three years (2016-2018):

PROXY SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (PAGE 30) 
Railcar leasing is our core business, accounting for approximately 85% of our 2018 revenue. Our rail customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the petroleum, chemical, fertilizer, food/agricultural, transportation, and construction industries. Combined with changing macroeconomic conditions and swings in railcar supply, this results in significant volatility in utilization and lease rates for railcars over time. At the same time, railcars have very long useful lives of 20-45 years. Thus, we have to proactively manage our business with a long-term view, which includes buying, leasing, maintaining, and selling railcars in these constantly changing business conditions over decades. 
Our compensation programs reflect this cyclicality by appropriately rewarding management to emphasize current financial returns over growth in capital employed during stronger markets and, conversely, to emphasize growth in capital employed over current financial returns in weaker markets. In this way, our Compensation Committee believes that our plans have been designed to reward executives for achieving those goals that will maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Our compensation plans are directly linked to our financial and operating performance and creation of long-term shareholder value. Approximately 80% of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and approximately 65% of our other named executive officers' compensation is performance based and not guaranteed. We encourage you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis starting on page 30 for more details regarding our performance and the alignment of our executive compensation with our performance and long-term shareholder value.

Proxy Statement 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors provides oversight, strategic direction, and counsel to management regarding the business, affairs, and long-term interests of GATX and our shareholders. Its responsibilities include the following: 
GATX has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance and ethical standards. Demonstrating this commitment, the Board has adopted the GATX Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Code of Ethics for 
 Senior Company Officers, as well as charters for each of the Board's committees. These documents constitute the foundation of our corporate governance structure and are available on our website (www.gatx.com) in the Investor Relations section under "Corporate Governance". 
The Board and its committees meet throughout the year on an established schedule and hold special meetings from time to time as appropriate. Following each meeting, the Board's independent directors meet in executive sessions without the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or other members of management present. The Lead Director serves as Chair of the executive sessions of the Board. 
The Board met seven times during 2018, and each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during the year. We encourage all directors to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and in 2018 all directors then serving on the Board attended the annual meeting. 
Board Independence 
The Board has adopted the GATX Director Independence Standard set forth in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement to evaluate the independence of directors and director nominees and to ensure compliance with the independence standards required by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") for listed companies. In accordance with this standard, and considering all relevant facts and circumstances, the Board has made an affirmative determination that none of the following directors has a material relationship with GATX other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Board and that all of the following directors are independent: Diane M. Aigotti, Anne L. Arvia, Ernst A. Häberli, James B. Ream, Robert J. Ritchie, David S. Sutherland, Casey J. Sylla, Stephen R. Wilson, and Paul G. Yovovich.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the members of the Board's Audit, Compensation, and Governance Committees are independent.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that having our Chief Executive Officer serve as Chairman of the Board is in the best interests of our shareholders because the Chief Executive Officer's extensive knowledge of our business and strategy provides the Board with a clear understanding of the issues facing the Company and promotes effective Board decision-making, alignment on corporate strategy, and effective execution of that strategy by management. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board believes it is important to select the most qualified and appropriate director to serve as Chairman, whether that individual is an outside director or a member of executive management. Currently, Brian A. Kenney, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as Chairman. The Board believes that Mr. Kenney is the most appropriate individual to serve as Chairman because of his extensive knowledge of our business and strategy, as well as his demonstrated skill and commitment to performing effectively as Chairman of the Board. Having the Chief Executive Officer serve as Chairman provides the Board with a clear understanding of issues facing GATX, which, in turn, promotes effective Board decision-making, alignment on corporate strategy, and accountability of management. 
Our Board is structured to promote independence whether or not its Chairman is a member of executive management. The entire Board, with the exception of Mr. Kenney, consists of independent directors, and the Audit, Compensation, and Governance Committees also are composed entirely of independent directors. The independent directors on the Board meet after each Board meeting in executive sessions that are not attended by Mr. Kenney or other members of management. 
In addition, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors serving on the Board annually designate an independent Lead Director to provide leadership to the non-management members of the Board and to work with the Chairman and Chief 
 Executive Officer and the other Board members to provide effective and independent oversight of our management and affairs. Currently, James B. Ream serves as Lead Director. The powers and duties of the Lead Director include the following:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance Committee. Each committee is composed of directors determined by the Board to be independent in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE. Mr. Ream serves as Lead Director and, while he does not serve as a member of any particular Board committee, he attends the meetings of all Board committees. 
The principal responsibilities of each of these committees are described generally below and in detail in their respective committee charters, which are available on our website (www.gatx.com) in the Investor Relations section under "Corporate Governance". 
Audit Committee 
The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee has accounting or related financial management expertise and is "financially literate", as that term is used in the listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert", as that term is defined by the rules of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). All members of the Audit Committee satisfy the NYSE's independence standards applicable to audit committee members. 
The Audit Committee's functions include the appointment, retention, compensation, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviews any related party transactions and assists the Board in oversight of: 
The Audit Committee maintains free and open communication, and meets separately at each regularly scheduled committee meeting, with our independent registered public accounting firm, our internal auditor, and management. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee's functions include: 
Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance") served as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant during 2018. In addition to providing advice on various aspects of GATX's compensation plans, programs, and policies, Pay Governance also advises the Compensation Committee periodically on current trends and best practices and reviews the agendas and supporting materials with management and the Compensation Committee Chair in advance of each committee meeting. A Pay Governance representative attends all Compensation Committee meetings, including executive sessions at which management is not present, and meets independently with the Compensation Committee as appropriate. In addition, Pay Governance provides specific recommendations for the Chief Executive Officer's compensation and advice on the recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the compensation of other executives. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Governance Committee 
The Governance Committee's functions include: 
Annual Board and Committee Evaluations 
The Board conducts an evaluation of its performance and effectiveness on an annual basis. The purpose of the evaluation is to obtain the directors' feedback on the Board's performance and identify ways to enhance its effectiveness. As part of the evaluation, each director receives a written questionnaire developed by the Governance Committee to solicit input on the Board's performance, effectiveness, composition, priorities, and culture. Using the questionnaire as a guide, the Governance Committee Chair conducts personal interviews with all directors to obtain their feedback and discuss any other issues or concerns they may have. The Governance Committee Chair compiles the collective views and comments of the directors and then reports the results of the evaluation to the full Board. 
Each of the Board's committees conducts its own evaluation using the same process as the Board evaluation. The Chair of each committee conducts personal interviews with the other committee members and, after compiling the results, presents a report to the committee and the full Board. 
Each year, the Governance Committee Chair conducts a personal interview with each Board member to gather in-depth perspectives and candid insight about Board performance and effectiveness. The Chair of each committee follows the same process to obtain feedback from committee members on the committee's performance and effectiveness. 
Board Refreshment 
The Board, led by the Governance Committee, regularly evaluates its own composition and succession plans in light of the Company's evolving business and strategic needs. The focus of this process is to ensure that the Board is composed of directors who possess a wide variety of relevant skills, professional experience, and backgrounds, bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, and effectively represent the long-term interests of shareholders. In identifying individuals for Board membership, the Governance Committee considers a candidate's gender, age, ethnicity, and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to an active, effective Board. The Board believes that new ideas and perspectives are critical to a forward-looking and strategic 
 Board, as are the extensive experience and deep understanding of our business and industry that long-serving directors possess. Accordingly, in its board refreshment and succession planning process, the Board considers both the benefits of continuity and fresh perspectives that new directors can bring. 
In considering potential director candidates, the Governance Committee and Board take into account, among other factors, the needs of the Board and the Company in light of the overall composition of the Board with a view to achieving a balance of the skills, experience, and attributes that would be beneficial to the Board's oversight role. For more information, see Director Criteria and Nomination Process on page 18.

Succession Planning 
The Board regularly reviews long-term and emergency succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and for other senior management positions. In assessing possible Chief Executive Officer candidates, the Board identifies the key skills, experience, and attributes it believes are required to be an effective Chief Executive Officer in light of the Company's business strategies, opportunities, and challenges. In addition, the Board ensures that directors have substantial opportunities over the course of the year to engage with possible succession candidates. As part of these long-term succession planning efforts, in August 2018, we implemented organizational changes to some of our senior leadership positions in order to enhance our growth efforts and further drive the excellent performance our shareholders expect.

Anti-Hedging, Anti-Pledging Policies 
In addition to prohibiting our directors, officers, and employees from trading in GATX stock while in possession of material non-public information, our Insider Trading Policy also prohibits certain transactions in GATX stock that may create the potential for the interests of a director, officer, or employee to diverge from the interests of GATX and its shareholders. In particular, our policy prohibits directors, officers, and employees from engaging in hedging transactions, including short sales, transactions in publicly traded options involving GATX stock, and use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. The policy also prohibits directors, officers, and employees from holding GATX stock in a margin account or pledging GATX stock as collateral for a loan. 
Related Party Transactions 
Related Party Transactions Approval Policy 
We recognize that transactions with related parties present a heightened risk of real or perceived conflicts of interest and, therefore, may raise questions as to whether those transactions are consistent with the best interests of GATX and its shareholders. Accordingly, we have a formal, written policy that requires all related party transactions to be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. A "related party transaction" means any transaction (or series of transactions) valued at over $120,000 in which GATX is a participant and in which any "related party" has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Our policy defines a "related party" to include all of our directors and executive officers, holders of more than 5% of our voting stock, and the immediate family members of those persons. 
Under our policy, the Audit Committee will approve a related party transaction only if it determines that the transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of GATX and our shareholders, including, for example, situations where: 
Upon completion of its review, the Audit Committee will approve or disapprove the related party transaction. In approving any related party transaction, the Audit Committee also will make a determination that the transaction does not constitute a conflict of interest under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance Arrangements 
As required by our By-Laws, we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with each member of the Board that contractually obligate us to provide this indemnification to our directors. 
As permitted by the New York Business Corporation Law and our By-Laws, we maintain insurance policies that provide liability protection to our directors and officers for claims for which they may not be indemnified by the Company. These insurance policies also provide reimbursement to GATX for indemnification payments we make on behalf of our directors and officers, subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in the policies.

Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that understanding issues of importance to our shareholders is critical for us to address their interests in a meaningful and effective way. It is also a tenet of good corporate governance. In that light, we engage with our shareholders on a regular basis to discuss a range of topics, including our performance, strategy, executive compensation, and corporate governance. Dialogue and engagement with our shareholders helps us understand how they view us, set goals and expectations for our performance, and identify emerging issues that may affect our strategies, corporate governance, compensation practices, or other aspects of our operations. 
Our shareholder outreach and engagement program takes many forms and is a year-round activity. We participate in numerous investor road shows, analyst meetings, and investor conferences. We also provide investors with access to our executive officers in an effort to provide a full perspective on business operations, market conditions, and our long-term strategy. We communicate with shareholders through various media, including our annual report and SEC filings, proxy statement, news releases, and our website. We hold conference calls for our quarterly earnings releases and other major corporate events which are open to all. These calls are available in real time and as archived webcasts on our website. 
Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and investor relations staff meet frequently with investors to discuss GATX's strategy, financial and business performance. In addition, members of our 
 Board, including our Lead Director, the Chair of the Governance Committee, and the Chair of the Compensation Committee meet with our large shareholders to discuss a range of issues, including executive compensation, corporate governance, and corporate social responsibility matters. 
During 2018, we met with eight of our 12 largest shareholders (representing approximately 67% of the shares outstanding) to discuss a range of issues, including: 
During our many shareholder interactions, we heard a diverse range of views. In general, our investors appreciated our transparency and willingness by our senior executives and members of the Board to engage with, and listen to, shareholders. In addition, we have made some enhancements to our Proxy Statement in response to suggestions from investors, including increased use of graphics and a more fulsome explanation of the qualifications of our directors and the role of our Lead Director.

         We seek to improve the energy efficiency of our railcar maintenance facilities, offices, and vessels by investing in key facility enhancements, engaging  employees, and incorporating sustainability principles into our operations.      We strive to efficiently utilize  water by seeking opportunities to reduce consumption and recycle water used by our railcar maintenance facilities, offices, and vessels.      Our  American Steamship Company subsidiary continues to partner with experts in the public and private sector to develop and test new technology to achieve higher levels of purity in ballast  water with the goal of eliminating non-native species from the ballast water of Great Lakes vessels.      We collaborate with our waste management vendors to reduce waste we send to landfills by identifying recycling opportunities and to ensure that the waste we produce is treated or disposed of in a safe and responsible manner.      We  are committed to maintaining compliance with air quality standards at railcar maintenance facilities and on vessels by monitoring emissions, using control technology to capture and reduce emissions, and  identifying opportunities to further reduce emissions by improving efficiency or substituting materials.                     GATX was the first U.S. railcar leasing company to achieve certification  as a Responsible Care® Partner, as certified by the American Chemistry Council (ACC)  and the Chemical Industry Association of Canada. Using the Responsible Care® framework, we have established an EHS management system that strives for continuous  improvement. We continually measure our performance and set goals for improvement in many key metrics such as safety incident rate, community involvement and support, environmental emissions, workers  compensation, waste generation, and energy consumption. Our management team takes an active role in developing and communicating our annual EHS goals across the organization and monitoring the  Companys efforts to achieve those goals.      Our repair and maintenance facilities maintain an ongoing relationship with first responders in the communities where we operate to coordinate response plans in the event of an EHS incident involving our railcars or our facilities.      GATX offers training on the proper use of our equipment and on  regulations that impact our business. We hold training sessions at our headquarters and at locations across North America through the use of our TankTrainer mobile  classroom. The TankTrainer mobile classroom is a 33,500-gallon tank car outfitted with a variety of fittings, coatings and configurations. Since 1993, the TankTrainer has provided a one-of-a-kind learning experience to thousands of employees, customers, rail and yard workers, first responders and others.                       We encourage diversity and inclusiveness  in our workforce, and our policies and programs are designed to provide fair treatment of all employees.      Our operations worldwide are conducted in a manner consistent with  internationally recognized principles regarding human rights, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Global Compact.      GATX  is proud to be the largest single corporate donor in the history of Make-A-Wish Illinois. In 2018, we were the  largest corporate donor to Make-A-Wish Illinois for the sixth year in a row.      In  2018, we continued our support of the Big Shoulders Funds Patrons Program by adopting two public schools in Chicago and offering our employees the opportunity to volunteer hours, guidance, tutoring, and much needed funding to help those inner-city schools succeed over the long-term.      We invest in the training and development  of our employees by offering them resources such as tuition reimbursement, professional development courses, and certification programs for maintenance personnel to enable career progression through higher skilled roles.      Our  Compliance Department manages a robust compliance program intended to provide our employees with meaningful resources, training, and communication to assist them in doing their jobs in an ethical manner, while  empowering them to raise questions and concerns without fear of retaliation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Communication with the Board 
GATX shareholders and other interested parties may, at any time, communicate directly with the Board, any of our directors individually (including the Lead Director), or our non-management directors as a group through the office of our Corporate Secretary as follows: 
Our Corporate Secretary will review communications received by any of these methods and forward the communication promptly to the Board, individual directors, the Lead Director, or the non-management directors as a group, as appropriate, depending on the subject matter and facts and circumstances described in the communication. 
Communications that are not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, are patently frivolous, or are otherwise considered to be improper for submission to the intended recipient(s), will not be forwarded. 
PROPOSAL 1:    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Criteria and Nomination Process 
Each year, the Board nominates a slate of director candidates for election at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board has delegated the process for screening potential director candidates to the Governance Committee with input from the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Lead Director. When the Governance Committee determines that it is desirable to add a director or fill a vacancy on the Board, it will identify one or more individuals qualified to become directors and recommend them to the Board. In identifying qualified individuals, the Governance Committee generally retains a search firm for this purpose. In evaluating individuals for potential membership on the Board, the Governance Committee gives due consideration to the following criteria: 
Nominees are selected so that the Board represents a diversity of viewpoints, professional experiences, education, skills, backgrounds, and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to an active, effective Board. 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Experience, Qualifications, and Skills 
The Governance Committee is responsible for recommending to the full Board a slate of director nominees who collectively have the complementary experience, qualifications, skills, and attributes to guide the Company and function effectively as a Board. We believe that each of the nominees satisfies the criteria for membership set forth above and has key skills and attributes that are important to an effective board. Each of the nominees, other than Mr. Kenney, is also independent of the Company and management. See Board Independence on page 7. 
Listed below are certain key experiences, qualifications, and skills of our director nominees that the Governance Committee believes are relevant and important in light of GATX's business and structure. 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Shareholder Recommendation and Nomination of Directors 
The Board also will consider any candidates who may be recommended by shareholders. The Board conducts such inquiry into each candidate's background, qualifications, and independence as it believes is necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and regardless of whether the candidate was recommended by shareholders or by others. Any recommendations of director candidates by shareholders should be submitted to the Governance Committee, c/o the Corporate Secretary, GATX Corporation, 233 South Wacker Drive, 
 Chicago, Illinois 60606-7147. The recommendation must be received not more than 120 and not less than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting and must include all information required by the proxy rules, applicable law, and our By-Laws. If a shareholder submits a director candidate in accordance with the requirements specified in our By-Laws, the Governance Committee will consider such director candidate using the same standards it applies to evaluate other director candidates. 
Nominees for Election to the Board of Directors 
Our Board is currently composed of ten directors, nine of whom are standing for re-election for a term of one year, to serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. Casey J. Sylla, who currently serves on the Board, will not be standing for re-election and will be retiring at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board is grateful to Mr. Sylla for his 14 years of dedicated and valuable service to the Company. 
All director nominees have consented to serve on the Board, if elected. At the time of the Annual Meeting, if any director nominee is unable or declines to serve, the proxies may be voted for any other person who may be nominated by the Board to fill the vacancy, or the size of the Board may be reduced accordingly. 
Please see below for information on the background of each of the nine director nominees, as well as each individual's specific experience, qualifications, and skills that led the Board to conclude that such individual should serve on the Board in light of the Company's business and leadership structure. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each director nominee named below.

Each director's phantom stock account is credited with additional units representing dividends declared on GATX common stock based on the date such dividend is paid. 
 At the expiration of each director's service on the Board, settlement of phantom stock units is made in shares of common stock equal to the number of units of phantom

stock then credited to his or her account. Any fractional units are paid in cash. Directors may elect to receive their payouts in a lump sum or up to ten annual installments in accordance with the terms, and subject to the limitations, set forth in the Directors' Phantom Stock Plan. 
We offer a Directors' Voluntary Deferred Fee Plan in which non-employee directors may defer receipt of the cash portion of their retainer in the form of either cash or phantom stock units. If the deferral is in cash, the deferred amount accrues interest at a rate equal to the 20-year US government bond rate. If the deferral is in units of phantom stock, the units are credited to an account for each participating director along with dividends and are settled, following expiration of the director's service on the Board, in accordance with his or her election/distribution form on file. Five directors participated in the Deferred Fee Plan in 2018. 
The stock ownership goal for non-employee directors is 5.0 times the annual cash retainer. New directors have five years following election to the Board to achieve this ownership goal. 
We are seeking your approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 30. We believe that we have designed compensation programs that pay for performance and align compensation with the long-term interests of our shareholders. In deciding how you vote on this proposal, we encourage you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for a full description of our executive compensation philosophy and programs, the decisions our Compensation Committee has made under those programs, and the factors it considers in making those decisions. 
Our financial results in 2018 were significantly better than we originally anticipated. Capitalizing on an improved railcar leasing environment in North America, we realized higher fleet utilization, a higher renewal success rate, and higher lease renewal rates versus our original expectations. Maintenance expense was also lower than anticipated in 2018 due to fewer repairs performed by railroads as well as fewer tank qualifications. While we saw broad increases in market lease rates in 2018, revenue was still pressured as new lease rates remained below rates on expiring leases signed during the previous strong market from 2012 to 2015 and the renewal lease rate change for GATX's Lease Price Index was negative 9.8% for the year. 
We executed on our strategy to invest aggressively in cost-advantaged railcars. In 2018, we entered into two long-term railcar supply agreements, for a total of 12,450 railcars to be delivered from 2019—2023, which will allow us to grow our asset base to meet the needs of our customers. We invested more than $730 million in our North American fleet in 2018, including the acquisition of a competitor's portfolio of approximately 3,100 railcars. We also continued to capitalize on strong North American secondary market demand by optimizing the fleet through railcar sales, generating significant remarketing income. 
In addition, our international railcar leasing business also outperformed our expectations and achieved record high fleet utilization, while our American Steamship subsidiary significantly increased its profitability by operating its fleet more efficiently and capitalizing on late season demand opportunities. Lastly, our aircraft spare engine leasing joint ventures with Rolls-Royce produced another year of strong financial results. 
Key accomplishments in 2018 included: 
We value the feedback provided by our shareholders, who approved our executive compensation program at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders by a vote of 98.0% in favor.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Summary 
Our Business and Strategy 
GATX is the leading global railcar lessor, owning and leasing railcars in North America, Europe, and Asia. Most of our railcar leases are full-service leases under which we provide maintenance, engineering, administrative, and a variety of other value-added services. We operate an extensive network of railcar maintenance facilities in the United States, Canada, and Europe dedicated to performing timely, efficient, and high quality maintenance for our railcar leasing customers. In addition, we operate the largest fleet of US-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes and invest with Rolls-Royce plc, a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft jet engines, in a group of joint ventures that lease aircraft spare engines. 
Railcar leasing is our core business, accounting for approximately 85% of our 2018 revenue. Our rail customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the petroleum, chemical, fertilizer, food/agricultural, transportation, and construction industries. Combined with changing macroeconomic conditions and swings in railcar supply, this results in significant volatility in utilization and lease rates for railcars over time. At the same time, railcars have very long useful lives of 20-45 years. Thus, we have to proactively manage our business with a long-term view, which includes buying, leasing, maintaining, and selling railcars into constantly changing business conditions over decades. 
We believe that the key to generating long-term shareholder value involves optimizing asset growth and asset return by emphasizing each at the appropriate point in the railcar business cycle. For example, in stronger railcar markets, we focus on increasing lease rates and lengthening lease term to lock-in attractive lease revenue as long as possible. At the same time, we de-emphasize new railcar investment due to the high railcar prices usually present in such a market. Conversely, in weaker markets, when railcar prices tend to be lower, we seek to increase railcar investment on favorable terms. We also aggressively reduce lease rates to maintain asset utilization and shorten lease terms to position us to capture value when lease rates improve. The following chart illustrates our approach to managing leases through these cycles over the past decade. 
The cyclicality of our industry is also illustrated by the backlog of orders at the railcar manufacturers. Rising backlogs tend to represent a strengthening market while falling backlogs tend to represent a weakening market. While we invest in railcars at all points in the business cycle, we strive to achieve lower railcar cost by trying to place large new railcar orders and acquire existing fleets in weaker markets when asset prices tend to be lower. The following chart illustrates this cyclicality and our efforts to focus on the lower points in the business cycle for large railcar investments.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Compensation Principles 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the oversight of our executive compensation program, including approval of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and establishing the performance goals used to determine the compensation of our executive officers. Our executive compensation program is based on the following principles: 
The Compensation Committee expects our executive team to create long-term shareholder value by growing capital employed while also earning an attractive return on that capital. The inherent cyclicality of the railcar leasing business is an important consideration in how we structure our executive compensation programs to appropriately incentivize management to achieve the financial goals that will positively impact the Company's performance over the long-term. 
Due to the cyclicality of our business, management must strategically shift the emphasis we place on each of these dual objectives (i.e., growth in capital employed and financial returns) to adapt to changes in market conditions. Our compensation programs reflect this cyclicality by appropriately rewarding management to emphasize current financial returns over growth in capital employed during stronger markets, and conversely, to emphasize growth in capital employed over current financial returns in weaker markets. In this way, the Compensation Committee believes that our plans have been designed to reward executives for achieving those goals that will maximize long-term shareholder value. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Compensation Plan Design 
The overarching goal of our compensation philosophy and incentive plan design is to incentivize management by aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. In 2018, approximately 80% of total direct compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and approximately 65% for our other NEOs, was performance-based and not guaranteed.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2018 Key Management Objectives 
As we entered 2018, there were signs of improvement in certain sectors of the railcar leasing market after a three-year downturn. However, we were unable to predict the pace and extent of any recovery. In light of these uncertain market conditions, we established the following performance objectives, among others: 
2018 Key Accomplishments 
Our financial results in 2018 were significantly better than we originally anticipated. Capitalizing on an improved railcar leasing environment in North America, we realized higher fleet utilization, a higher renewal success rate, and higher lease renewal rates versus our original expectations. Maintenance expense was lower than anticipated in 2018 due to fewer repairs performed by railroads as well as fewer tank qualifications. We also executed on our strategy to invest aggressively in cost-advantaged railcars. 
Key highlights of our performance in 2018 include the following:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Performance Measures, Goal Setting, and Pay-for-Performance Alignment 
Our unique position as an independent, publicly traded railcar lessor means that there are no directly comparable peers against which we can assess pay and performance. Over the last few years, our Compensation Committee has considered multiple approaches to identifying a relevant peer group but has found all of them to lack appropriate comparability. For example, the companies in our General Industry Classification Standard (GICS) code have significantly different business models, customer bases, and asset composition, and they lack GATX's focus on very long-lived assets. Our competitors in the railcar leasing industry are typically very small parts of much larger diversified companies, which may or may not be publicly traded, making comparisons extremely difficult. However, we compete for executive talent against these much larger organizations. Lacking a clear group of peers for comparison, our Compensation Committee has chosen to use multiple data points to assess our executive compensation, including: 
In addition to the unavailability of relevant peer pay data, lack of a peer group makes it difficult to compare GATX's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") to the TSR of other companies in our industry because there are no other independent, publicly traded railcar leasing companies that we believe would provide a useful basis for comparison. This is the primary reason why our Compensation Committee does not use relative TSR as a performance measure in our annual and long-term incentive plans. Instead, the Compensation Committee has chosen to use performance measures that reflect our financial performance and the cyclical nature of our business. 
In setting the performance measures for our annual and long-term plans, our Compensation Committee sets goals intended to align executive compensation with the appropriate achievement of our dual goals of growth and return at various points in the business cycle. Reflecting this focus, our Compensation Committee uses net income, return on equity, and investment volume as the performance measures in all of our annual and long-term incentive plans. The Compensation Committee sets the performance goals for each of these measures with the intent of focusing management on achieving results that will have the biggest impact on our financial performance and long-term shareholder value in light of where we are in the business cycle. The following graphs show our compensation plan goals for our NEOs in 2018, and our actual achievement against such goals, for each of net income, return on equity, and investment volume. 
Annual Incentive Plan Measure 
Net Income1 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   For annual incentive award purposes, net income excludes tax adjustments and other items. For a reconciliation of net  income, excluding tax adjustments and other items, to net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
When the Compensation Committee set the target for our annual incentive plan at the beginning of 2018, we were continuing to experience pressure on revenues as new lease rates remained below expiring rates and the persistent oversupply of railcars in the market continued. As a result, the speed and extent of any recovery in the railcar leasing market remained uncertain. In addition, the Committee also anticipated higher maintenance expenses in 2018 due to the significant amount of scheduled maintenance events for various railcars in our fleet, which was expected to further challenge financial performance. Our Compensation Committee desired to set a net income target for our NEOs that would be appropriately rigorous and challenging. The Committee set the 2018 net income target at budgeted net income of $170.7 million. Based on the 2018 plan design, our net income achievement of 117.1% of target resulted in a payout to our NEOs at 129.1% of their target awards. 2018 and 2017 actual net income performance shown in the chart above reflects certain adjustments during the year.1 See Annual Incentive Awards on page 40 for more details about our annual incentive plan and how this payout was determined. 
Performance Share Plan Measures 
Under the terms of our 2016-2018 performance share program, our actual average return on equity and cumulative investment volume results exceeded target, which resulted in our executives earning 126.4% of their target performance shares. However, the actual value of the payouts depends upon the market price of our common stock on the vesting date, which may be higher or lower than the grant price. See 2018-2020 Performance Share Measures and Goal Setting on page 42 for a description of our performance share program. The return on equity and investment volume measures are weighted equally in calculating our Performance Share Plan results. Our Compensation Committee believes that these two measures strike an appropriate balance between achieving a meaningful return for our shareholders while holding to a disciplined investment strategy through business cycles. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   We report return on equity, calculated in accordance with GAAP, in our financial statements. We also use return on  equity as a performance measure for our long-term equity incentive awards, including our performance shares. For purposes of calculating performance share plan results, return on equity excludes (i) the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of  2017 and (ii) accumulated other comprehensive income for each year. Please see Exhibit B of this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of return on equity calculated for performance share purposes to return on equity calculated in  accordance with GAAP.

CEO Pay-For-Performance Alignment 
We continue to maintain a strong pay and performance linkage through all points in the business cycle, as illustrated in the following charts, which show our Chief Executive Officer's compensation measured against our financial performance for the years 2008-2018. As we continue to manage through challenging market conditions in the railcar leasing industry, our Compensation Committee expects management to emphasize disciplined growth and investment over short-term financial returns.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Shareholder Return and CEO Compensation 
The chart below compares the changes in shareholder return and our Chief Executive Officer's compensation over the past eleven years, which have been representative of the cyclical nature of the railcar leasing market. During this time frame, our Chief Executive Officer's compensation remained relatively flat, with year-
to-year volatility in line with our annual financial performance as highlighted above. Since 2008, total direct compensation for our Chief Executive Officer has increased by 42.0%, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3.5%, while TSR increased 210.0%, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%. 
    *     Amounts are as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, less changes in pension value. 
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 98.0% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of an advisory resolution approving the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in our 2018 proxy statement (the "say-on-pay" resolution). The Compensation Committee believes that the overwhelming shareholder vote in favor of the say-on-pay resolution was an affirmation of shareholders' support of our approach to executive compensation and, therefore, did not make any changes to its executive compensation plans or programs as a result of the vote.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Detailed Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
In 2018, our executive compensation program consisted of three elements: Base salary, annual incentive, and long-term equity compensation. We also provide various retirement and benefit programs, which are generally available to all employees. Further details on each element of compensation are discussed below. 
Base Salary 
Base salary constitutes approximately 19% of total targeted compensation for our Chief Executive Officer (approximately 37% for our other NEOs), which is consistent with our philosophy that a majority of executive compensation should be performance-based. 
In establishing salary levels, we typically consider market pay levels, the specific responsibilities and experience of each NEO, and his or her individual performance. Base salaries may be adjusted during the Compensation Committee's annual review for: 
In 2018, Messrs. Kenney, Ellman, Lyons, and Titterton and Ms. Golden received the Company's standard general increase of 2.5% to their base salaries. Mr. Ellman received an additional 6% increase to recognize his performance, consistent with market levels. Mr. Titterton received an additional 14% increase in connection with his promotion to Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Rail North America. 
While the Company's 2019 annual salary increases will reflect an average increase of 3%, Mr. Kenney's base salary for 2019 will remain unchanged at his request. Ms. Golden will receive an additional 5% increase to recognize her performance, consistent with market pay levels. Mr. Titterton's general increase will be prorated from the date of his promotion to Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Rail North America, on August 9, 2018. 
Annual Incentive Awards 
Process for Setting Annual Incentive Targets 
Target incentive opportunities for NEOs are expressed as a percentage of base salary and are intended to be competitive with the market. Please see The Determination of Market Competitive Pay on page 45 for a description of how we determine competitive pay levels. For 2019, target incentive opportunities for our NEOs remained unchanged from 2018 levels. Mr. Kenney's target incentive opportunity is 100% of his base salary. The target annual incentive opportunities for our other NEOs are 70% of base salary for Messrs. Lyons, and Ellman, 60% of base salary for Ms. Golden, and 55% of base salary for Mr. Titterton. 
Annual Incentive Plan Design 
Our NEOs earn their annual incentive awards under our Cash Incentive Compensation Plan (the "CICP") based on achievement of pre-established financial performance goals. The CICP is designed to arrive at a maximum possible incentive award, which then may be reduced by the Compensation Committee based on such other metrics as it may determine appropriate. This design was originally intended to meet requirements for tax deductibility then in effect, while providing the Compensation Committee the flexibility to adjust performance metrics as necessary to meet our strategic business needs. 
Under the CICP, a maximum bonus of 0.75% of "Total Gross Income Less Total Ownership Costs" (as such term is defined in the CICP) is earned. However, as previously mentioned, the Compensation Committee does not expect to pay the full amount. Rather, it has historically measured performance against targeted net income and determined bonuses based on achievement against a net income goal established from a financial plan which is reviewed by the full Board. The Compensation Committee has chosen net income as the goal because it provides executives with a strong incentive to increase our profitability. 
The performance metrics and payout levels are established at the beginning of each year by the Compensation Committee with input from the independent consultant and management. The level of financial performance required for the maximum payout is established based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of the level of performance that shareholders would likely consider superior in view of general economic conditions and the economic outlook for GATX and its industry in particular. This process is essentially reversed to establish the threshold or minimum performance level, defined as the level of financial performance below which no incentive is payable. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2018 Annual Incentive Plan Design. When the Compensation Committee set the target for our annual incentive plan at the beginning of 2018, we were continuing to experience pressure on revenues as new lease rates remained below expiring rates and the persistent oversupply of railcars in the market continued. As a result, the speed and extent of any recovery in the railcar leasing market remained uncertain. In addition, the Committee also anticipated higher maintenance expenses in 2018 due to the significant amount of scheduled maintenance events for various railcars in our fleet, which was expected to further challenge financial performance. Our Compensation Committee desired to set a net income target for our NEOs that would be appropriately rigorous and challenging. The Committee set the 2018 net income target at budgeted net income of $170.7 million. 
The goals and payout levels under the 2018 annual incentive plan design are shown in the following table:

      Maximum      $239.0        140%       170% 
[END TABLE]
2018 Annual Incentive Plan Payouts. Net income, excluding tax adjustments and other items, for 2018, was $199.8 million1, which was 117.1% of the target level of performance. Based on the targets illustrated above, this level of performance resulted in incentive payouts to our NEOs of 129.1% of their target award levels. 
Long-Term Equity Based Incentive Awards 
Process for Granting Awards 
We set target long-term incentive opportunities for our NEOs to be competitive with the market. The value of the regular, annual long-term incentive awards to each NEO is divided equally between non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs") and performance shares. We chose this combination of grant types because it focuses executive attention on total shareholder return and on specific financial goals, both of which are essential to our long-term success. The grant date for regular long-term incentive awards is the date of the Compensation Committee's first meeting of each calendar year. We grant NQSOs to NEOs at the same time we grant them to other employees. NQSOs vest ratably over a three-year period and expire seven years after the grant date. We have no program, plan, or practice to time NQSO grants to NEOs or any other employees in coordination with the release of material non-public information. We generally make off-cycle grants (if any) to newly hired employees on the last trading date of the month following the hire date and Compensation Committee approval of the award. 
During 2018, as part of our longer-term management succession efforts, Mr. Lyons and Mr. Ellman switched positions and Mr. Titterton was promoted. In order to continue to drive performance and enhance our growth efforts, and to recognize, motivate, and reward these executives in their new roles, each received an off-cycle grant of restricted stock units ("RSUs") which vest 25% on the first anniversary of the grant and 75% on the third anniversary of the grant, subject to continued employment with GATX. 
Award Types and How Each Fits Into Our Program 
Non-Qualified Stock Options. NQSOs are granted to align the interests of our NEOs and other employees with our shareholders. NQSOs are granted at a price equal to fair market value of our common stock (the average of the high and low trading prices on the date of grant) as approved by the Compensation Committee. Because TSR is comprised of stock price appreciation and dividends, dividend equivalents are attached to NQSOs. We believe that rewarding both components of shareholder return better aligns management and shareholder interests. Dividend equivalents accrue until vesting and are paid in cash thereafter until the NQSO is exercised or expires. Because the value of dividend equivalents is fully factored into the determination of grant size, the number of NQSOs granted is correspondingly smaller than it would be if dividend equivalents were not attached because the value of each NQSO is higher.

Performance Shares. Performance shares are designed to focus attention on, and to reward the achievement of, our long-term financial and strategic objectives. The Compensation Committee establishes the goals for which the performance shares may be earned at the beginning of a three-year performance period rather than annually. At the end of the performance period, a percentage ranging from 0% to 200% of the number of performance shares initially awarded will be earned based on the extent to which the three-year goals are achieved. The value of each earned performance share equals the price of one share of our common stock at the end of the performance period, with payment of earned performance shares made in the form of GATX common stock.

       payout in the form of cash, if the participant meets one of two conditions: (1) the participant has exceeded 150% of his or her stock ownership goal or (2) the participant is within  five years of normal retirement age (65) under the Company's pension plan. This election must be made no later than November 30 of the last year of the performance period and may be made only during an open trading window when  participants are not subject to insider trading restrictions. The cash value will be determined based on the number of performance shares earned multiplied by the fair market value of GATX stock on the day the award is earned. This optional cash  election feature was implemented to address the accumulation of high concentrations of GATX stock beyond the required stock ownership requirements and limited opportunities to diversify due to restrictions related to the trading of GATX stock, such  as insider trading blackouts. As such, the Compensation Committee believes that there should be an appropriate balance between our compensation programs and philosophy and the participants' needs for moderate and transparent diversification as  they approach retirement.

Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units vest based solely on continued employment and are designed to recognize and incentivize executives, by providing equity value if the executive remains employed through the vesting date. RSUs have not historically been a part of our equity compensation program, however, in 2018 the Compensation Committee granted RSUs to Messrs. Ellman, Lyons and Titterton in order to recognize, motivate, and reward these executives as they moved into new leadership roles as part of the Board's longer-term senior management succession planning efforts. These RSU grants also served as consideration for the non-compete, non-solicitation and confidential information covenants GATX obtained from Messrs. Ellman, Lyons and Titterton in connection with the changes in their respective roles. 
2018-2020 Performance Share Measures and Goal Setting 
Background 
Our target setting process, conducted at the beginning of each three-year performance period, combines goals related to growth and return to reflect the cyclical nature of our business. Our targets are designed to incentivize behavior which enhances long-term shareholder value at all points in the business cycle. 
Design 
In addition to the Total Gross Income Less Total Ownership Costs threshold goal specified in the GATX Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Award Plan, the number of performance shares that will be earned in 
 2020 will also be subject to two equally weighted measures: 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Compensation Committee set targets of 8.9% for return on equity and $2.5 billion for cumulative investment volume for the 2018-2020 performance period, both of which are significantly higher than the Company's budgeted return on equity (8.1%) and cumulative investment volume ($2.26 billion) for the three-year performance period. 
Rationale 
As stated above, we establish our growth and return objectives depending on where we are in the business cycle. When the market is stronger and asset prices are high, we emphasize earning a higher return over making investments to grow capital employed. When the market is weaker and asset prices are reduced, we emphasize making prudent investments at attractive prices over attempting to earn an unrealistically high short-term return. We believe that a single-minded focus on achieving growth over return, or vice versa, at the wrong points in the cycle is likely to impair shareholder value over the longer term. 
The return on equity and cumulative investment targets for the 2018-2020 performance period were set in the first quarter of 2018 amidst signs of strengthening in the North American railcar leasing market after a three-year downturn. Consistent with our objective of striking an appropriate balance between our growth and return objectives in light of uncertain market conditions, the 
 Compensation Committee set a lower target for average return on equity for the 2018-2020 performance period (8.9%) than for the prior three-year performance period. However, the target is 10% higher than the Company's budgeted return on equity for the 2018-2020 performance period, and the Compensation Committee believes that achievement of a 8.9% return on equity for the three-year performance period would represent excellent financial achievement by GATX in challenging market conditions. The Compensation Committee set the cumulative investment volume target for the 2018-2020 performance period at $2.5 billion, which is 11% higher than our budgeted cumulative investment volume for the 2017-2019 performance period. This aggressive cumulative investment volume target is consistent with our goal to pursue a disciplined investment strategy by investing more in weaker markets at attractive prices and less in stronger markets when asset prices are at or near their peak. 
Formula for Determining Award Numbers 
In granting performance shares for the 2018-2020 performance period, we determined the number of shares awarded by dividing the value of the performance share award by the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the four Fridays immediately preceding the Compensation Committee meeting at which the grant was awarded. To determine the number of NQSOs awarded, we used the same average closing price multiplied by 32%, which represents the value of the NQSO award based on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Payouts 
The performance shares granted in 2016 vested at the end of 2018. Each target award was based 50% on a three-year average return on equity goal and 50% on a three-year cumulative investment volume goal.1 The goals and payout levels under the 2016-2018 Performance Share Plan are indicated in the following table:

[END TABLE]
As shown in the charts on page 36, the three-year average return on equity for the period was 14.0% versus a goal of 12.0%, and the cumulative investment volume for the period was $2.17 billion, which was higher than the goal of $2.15 billion. Based on these results, performance share payouts were 126.4% of target. Performance share award values at vesting were 231.0% of target award values based on average fair market value of GATX stock price on January 24, 2019. Messrs. Kenney, Ellman, and Lyons and Ms. Golden elected to receive their performance share payouts in the form of cash. Mr. Titterton received his performance share payout in the form of shares. For details regarding the 2016-2018 performance share payments to the NEOs, please see the Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table on page 52. 
Employee Benefits – Severance – Double Trigger Vesting 
Employee Benefit Plans 
We sponsor a standard array of retirement, health, and welfare benefits. Our retirement programs include 401(k) and defined benefit pension programs, as well as a supplemental plan intended solely to restore pension benefits limited by law to the level specified by formula in the qualified pension plan applicable to all salaried employees. The pension and 401(k) programs are intended to supplement employees' personal retirement savings and social security benefits. Health and welfare benefits include medical, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance. These programs provide protection against catastrophic loss and encourage health maintenance. NEOs participate in the same programs, and on the same basis, as other salaried employees. No retirement, savings, medical, disability, or other insurance program or arrangement exists which provides benefits to our NEOs in excess of those provided to other salaried employees generally. No excessive perquisites were paid to our NEOs in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  We report return on equity, calculated in accordance with GAAP, in our financial statements. We also use return on  equity as a performance measure for our long-term equity incentive awards, including our performance shares. For purposes of calculating performance share plan results, return on equity excludes (i) the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of  2017 and (ii) accumulated other comprehensive income for each year. Please see Exhibit B of this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of return on equity calculated for performance share purposes to return on equity calculated in  accordance with GAAP.  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Change of Control Agreements 
We have entered into agreements with our NEOs that provide certain benefits if employment is terminated following a change of control ("COC"). This protection is provided for competitive reasons and to ensure the stability, continuity, and impartiality of our executives in a COC situation. The level of protection provided is intended to be similar to that provided by similarly sized organizations. 
The COC agreements are "double-trigger" agreements, meaning that benefits are payable only if a COC occurs and an executive's employment is terminated or constructively terminated. For a description of the key terms of these agreements, please see Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control on page 53. Since 2009, we have not entered into any new COC agreements that provide excise tax gross-up benefits, and we do not intend to offer this feature in the future. We do, however, have older agreements entered into in 2009 or earlier that have excise tax gross-up benefits. In the event that we amend such agreements for any reason in the future, we will eliminate such excise tax gross-ups.
Double-Trigger Equity Vesting 
The vesting of equity awards upon a COC is determined under the GATX Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Award Plan and related grant agreements. These terms apply to all employees who receive long-term incentive awards. In addition, all grant agreements require both a COC event and an executive's actual or constructive termination before vesting is accelerated. 
Process for Determining Executive Compensation (Including NEOs) 
Compensation Committee and Management 
The Compensation Committee, with input from the independent compensation consultant, regularly reviews: 
Our human resources staff and the Chief Executive Officer also provide input to the Compensation Committee regarding base salary increases, target level annual incentives, long-term incentive awards, and the goals applicable to earning such compensation. After reviewing these recommendations, the Compensation Committee determines and approves the compensation of each NEO as well as the performance goals. Our Chief Executive Officer, however, does not participate in, nor is he present during, any discussions of his own compensation. Such discussions occur during the Compensation Committee's executive sessions. The Compensation Committee also reviews its pay decisions regarding our Chief Executive Officer with the other independent directors on the Board. 
The Determination of Market Competitive Pay 
We have structured our compensation programs to provide total direct compensation opportunities comparable to the median range of opportunities provided by companies of similar revenue size to GATX (which we refer to as "competitive" or "market" pay levels throughout this Compensation Discussion and Analysis). 
Because we have no direct peers in the railcar leasing business for which relevant compensation data is available, gathering information on competitive pay levels with precision for our particular industry is not possible. Instead, the Compensation Committee, with assistance from our human resources staff and the independent compensation consultant, regularly reviews information on pay for executives as reported in national compensation surveys published by Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson for organizations of similar revenue as ours. 
These surveys include general, non-company specific compensation information, on an aggregate basis, for approximately 225 public companies with annual revenues between $1-3 billion. We use these surveys to better understand current compensation practices at other companies of similar revenue size and as a data point to assist us in meeting our goal of having the various elements of compensation be market-competitive. 
While these surveys are a starting point for our compensation review process, actual compensation decisions with respect to specific individuals are influenced by a variety of factors in addition to the surveys, including experience, tenure, skills, unique responsibilities, individual performance, and our specific talent requirements. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Compensation Governance 
Stock Ownership and Stock Retention Requirements 
To underscore the importance of stock ownership, we have established mandatory stock ownership and stock retention policies for our NEOs and other members of senior management. These policies require that each executive must retain shares of GATX stock having a value equal to 50% of the after-tax profits realized from GATX equity awards until the executive owns GATX shares equal in value to a multiple of salary based on his or her position. The multiple is 5.0 times salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 2.5 times salary for other NEOs. 
As of January 31, 2019, all of our NEOs had exceeded their respective stock ownership requirements, having achieved the following approximate percentages of their respective requirements: Mr. Kenney (377%), Mr. Ellman (350%), Mr. Lyons (431%), Ms. Golden (287%) and Mr. Titterton (118%). 
Clawback Policy 
We have a policy which provides for the recovery of all or part of any bonus or other compensation paid to an executive officer that was based upon the achievement of financial results that were subsequently restated. In the event of a material restatement of our financial results, the Board, or a committee designated by the Board, will review the facts and circumstances that led to the restatement and will take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate. The Board will consider whether any executive officer received excess compensation because the original financial statements were incorrectly presented. In addition, the Board will consider the accountability of any executive officer whose acts or omissions were responsible in whole or in part for the events that led to the restatement and whether such acts or omissions constituted misconduct. Under such policy, the Board may also, depending upon the facts and circumstances, take disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, or decide to pursue other available remedies, including, but not limited to, canceling stock-based awards. 
Section 162(m) Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation a company can deduct in any one year for certain executive officers. While our Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions as described earlier in this CD&A and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible by GATX for tax purposes. 
Compensation Committee's Independent Consultant 
The independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, has been retained by, and reports directly to, the Compensation Committee and does not have any other consulting engagements with management or GATX. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance and its employees working on GATX matters pursuant to applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards and determined that no conflict of interest or independence concerns exist. 
With respect to Chief Executive Officer compensation, Pay Governance provides an independent recommendation to the Compensation Committee in the form of a range of possible outcomes, for the committee's consideration. In developing its recommendation, Pay Governance relies on its understanding of GATX's business and compensation programs and its own independent research and analysis. Pay Governance does not meet with our Chief Executive Officer with respect to his compensation. In addition to advising on Chief Executive Officer compensation, Pay Governance reviews the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations on compensation of his direct reports.

(4)  Change in pension value reflects the increase in the present value of the accumulated pension benefit during the years  shown. The Pension Benefits Table shows the present value of the accumulated pension benefit as of December 31, 2018 and the assumptions used in the calculation of that value. We determined the December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016  present values using the same assumptions except that the interest rates used for discounting under ASC Topic No. 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, were 3.68% in 2017 and 4.22% in 2016.  
(5)  For 2018, amounts shown reflect matching contributions of $8,250 we made to the GATX Salaried Employees Retirement  Savings Plan for each NEO. For all periods presented, this column excludes dividends on SARs and performance shares because those dividends are included in the grant date fair value amounts for stock awards as reported in columns (e) and  (f) of the table above and in column (m) of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

Narrative Discussion Related to the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
Annual Incentive Awards 
In 2018, our NEOs were eligible for annual incentive awards based solely on financial performance goals measured in terms of GATX net income. The target incentive awards were payable at 100% of targeted net income. Threshold and maximum incentive awards (70% and 170%, respectively, of the target awards) were payable at 80% and 140% or more of targeted net income. 
Based on individual targets and on actual net income as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, 2018 incentive payouts under the GATX Cash Incentive Compensation Plan are shown in column (g) of the Summary Compensation Table. GATX net income achievement for 2018 was $199.8 million for incentive payout purposes, or 117.1% of target for our NEOs, resulting in payouts at 129.1% of their target awards.1 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   For annual incentive award purposes, net income excludes tax adjustments and other items. For a reconciliation of net  income, excluding tax adjustments and other items, to net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Equity-Based Long-Term Incentives 
Equity-based long-term incentive awards in 2018 consisted of NQSOs and performance shares. 
NQSOs vest in three equal annual installments and expire seven years after the grant date. The grant price is based on the average of the high and low prices of GATX common stock on the date of grant. Dividend equivalents accrue on NQSO grants and are not paid until vesting and each quarter thereafter until the NQSOs are exercised or expire. The NQSOs granted to the NEOs on January 25, 2018 will vest in three equal installments on January 25 of 2019, 2020, and 2021. 
The number of NQSOs awarded in 2018 and their grant date fair value are shown in columns (j) and (m), respectively, in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The grant date fair value of the 2018, 2017, and 2016 NQSO awards are shown in column (f) of the Summary Compensation Table for each year granted. 
The percentage of each performance share award that will be earned is based on the extent to which pre-established goals on two independent performance measures, each of which is weighted at 50%, are achieved over a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2020. The two performance measures are three-year average return on equity (defined as net income divided by average equity) and three-year cumulative investment volume (defined as the sum of cumulative GAAP-basis portfolio investments and capital additions as reported on the Company's audited statement of cash flows for each year in the performance period), subject to adjustment. 
The number of performance shares earned at the end of the performance period ranges from 0% to 200% of the initial target grant. For the return on equity component, the 2018 target grant will be earned if return on equity is 100% of targeted performance. The threshold and maximum number of performance shares are 25% and 200% of the target grant, respectively. For the cumulative investment volume component, the 2018 target grant is earned if cumulative investment volume is 100% of targeted performance. The threshold and maximum number of performance shares are 25% and 200% of the target grant, respectively. Dividend equivalents accrue throughout the performance period and are only paid on the number of performance shares earned at the end of the performance period. 
The grant date fair value of the 2018, 2017, and 2016 performance shares are shown in column (e) of the Summary Compensation Table. The number of performance shares granted in 2018 that may be earned at target, threshold, and maximum levels is shown in columns (f), (g), and (h), respectively, of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

(1)  Present value of accumulated benefit is calculated as the amount payable at age 65. The GATX Non-Contributory Pension Plan for Salaried Employees Plan assumption is that 60% will elect the lump sum option and 40% will elect the annuity option at retirement. The GATX Supplemental Retirement Plan calculations  use each NEO's actual election for payment of future benefit; all NEOs shown have elected a lump sum form of payment. The value of the annuity option is calculated using December 31, 2018, ASC Topic No. 715, Compensation —  Retirement Benefits, disclosure assumptions (4.32% interest rate, RP-2006 Healthy Annuitant Mortality Table generationally projected by Scale MP2018). Lump sums are valued at age 65 using the IRS three-segment  lump sum rates and are then discounted back from age 65 to December 31, 2018 at 4.32% and 4.26% for the Salaried Plan and Non-Qualified Supplemental Plan, respectively.  
(2)  NEOs may also qualify for subsidized early retirement benefits.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Narrative Discussion Related to Pension Benefits Table 
NEOs participate in our Non-Contributory Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (the "Qualified Plan"), which covers salaried employees of GATX and its domestic subsidiaries. 
All NEOs have met the Qualified Plan's vesting requirement. Subject to certain limitations imposed by law, pensions are based on years of service and average monthly compensation during (i) the five consecutive calendar years of highest compensation during the last 15 calendar years preceding retirement or the date on which employment terminates or (ii) the 60 consecutive calendar months preceding retirement or the date on which employment terminates, whichever is greater. Benefits under the Qualified Plan are not subject to any deduction for Social Security or other offset amounts. 
Annual benefits in excess of certain limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the Internal Revenue Code on payments from the Qualified Plan will be paid by the Company under the GATX Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Non-Qualified Plan"). The Non-Qualified Plan is designed to restore those benefits that would otherwise be limited by statutory regulations. Payments are made as a single lump sum amount representing the actuarially equivalent present value of the benefit payable at age 65. Payments made pursuant to the Non-Qualified Plan are funded from the general assets of the Company. 
Key provisions of the Qualified Plan include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Social Security Covered Compensation multiplied by years of benefit service (to a maximum of 35 years).  
[END TABLE]
"Compensation" is defined as regular earnings during the calendar year, including covered bonuses but excluding deferred and contingent compensation. For NEOs, compensation includes salary and annual incentive awards paid under the GATX Cash Incentive Compensation Plan. For the Final Average Pay Formula, "Social Security Covered Compensation" means the 35-year average of Social Security taxable wage bases in effect up to and including the year in which an individual attains Social Security Normal Retirement Age calculated in accordance with Revenue Ruling 89-70. 
For unmarried participants, the normal form of payment is a life annuity. For married participants, the normal form of payment is a 50% joint-and-survivor annuity. Optional forms of payment include a single lump sum of the accrued pension's actuarially equivalent present value, or a joint and survivor co-pensioner annuity. All forms of payment have the same actuarially equivalent value as the life annuity. 
The present value of accumulated pension benefits for each NEO is shown in column (d) of the Pension Benefits Table. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
Except for the COC agreements described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we have not entered into employment agreements with any of the NEOs. They participate in the same plans and are subject to the same treatment as all other salaried employees in the event of termination due to voluntary resignation, discharge for cause, involuntary separation, death, disability, and retirement. This discussion, and the table that follows, therefore focuses solely on termination in the event of a change of control of GATX. The key provisions of the COC agreements are described below, followed by a table that shows the amounts that we would pay or the benefits we would have provided to each NEO if such a change of control situation had occurred on December 31, 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the total annual compensation of Brian A. Kenney, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), to the total annual compensation of our median employee for our last completed fiscal year. 
In 2018, our last completed fiscal year, the total annual compensation of our CEO as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $5,792,282. The total annual compensation of our median employee, calculated in the same manner as the CEO's, was $54,243. As a result, for 2018, our estimate of the ratio of our CEO's total annual compensation to the total annual compensation of our median employee was approximately 107 to 1. 
We are permitted to use of the same median employee identified on October 1, 2017 for up to three years unless there has been a meaningful change to our employee population, or a change in employee compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant modification to the pay ratio disclosure. Also, within those three years, if the median employee's compensation significantly changes, we may use another employee whose compensation is comparable to the original median employee based on the compensation measure used to select the original median employee. 
As of October 1, 2018, we employed approximately 2,184 people, with 1,355 located in the United States and 829 located outside the United States. We continue to exclude employees in India (14), Russia (3), and France (3) given the small number of employees located in those jurisdictions. This is comparable to 2,263 employed on October 1, 2017, with 1,403 located in the United States and 860 located outside the United States. There have been no changes in employee compensation arrangements that could significantly impact our pay ratio. 
However, our original median employee had a change in circumstances during 2018 which made using his/her compensation inappropriate, as it would significantly change the pay ratio. Accordingly, we identified a new median employee for this year by looking back at the original dataset by which we identified our original median employee. For our new median employee, we chose the employee with compensation that was the closest in proximity to our original median employee. We then calculated the actual annual total compensation for this new median employee using the same methodology we used in 2017. 
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, and our Board is seeking shareholder ratification of the appointment. EY and its predecessor firms have served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1916. 
Shareholder ratification of this appointment is not required by our By-Laws or applicable laws and regulations. However, our Board annually submits this appointment for shareholder ratification as an element of our strong governance program. While this vote cannot be binding, if shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee will take the vote into account in making future appointments. 
Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by shareholders. 
Audit Committee Evaluation 
In determining whether to reappoint EY, the Audit Committee considered the qualifications, performance, and independence of the firm and the audit engagement team, the quality of its discussions with EY, and the fees charged by EY for the breadth of services provided. In connection with the 2019 appointment, the Audit Committee considered, among other things, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       the Audit Committee and management, and areas of continued focus and improvement opportunities  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee determined that the appointment of EY is in the best interest of GATX and our shareholders. The Audit Committee has appointed, subject to stockholder ratification, EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 and recommends that shareholders ratify the appointment at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to ratify Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities, as set forth in its charter, include providing oversight of our financial accounting and reporting process through periodic meetings with our management, independent registered public accounting firm, and internal auditors to review accounting, auditing, internal controls, and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee Charter is available on our website (www.gatx.com) in the Investor Relations section under "Corporate Governance". 
The Audit Committee has the ultimate authority to select and engage our independent registered public accounting firm, evaluate its performance, evaluate the performance of the lead audit partner, oversee the required rotation of the lead audit partner every five years, review and consider the selection of the lead audit partner, approve all audit and non-audit work, and approve all associated fees. The Audit Committee's oversight includes regular private sessions with the independent registered public accounting firm and discussions with the firm regarding the scope of its audit. 
GATX management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of our financial reporting information and related systems of internal control. In the discharge of its functions, the Audit Committee relies on our management (including senior financial management), internal audit staff, and independent registered public accounting firm. 
It is not the Audit Committee's responsibility to plan or conduct audits or to determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. That work is the responsibility of GATX management and our independent registered public accounting firm. In making its recommendation to the Board noted below, the Audit Committee has relied on management to prepare the financial statements with integrity and objectivity and in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee consists of five directors: Anne L. Arvia (Chair), Diane M. Aigotti, Robert J. Ritchie, Casey J. Sylla, and Stephen R. Wilson, each of whom is an "independent director" under the NYSE listing standards applicable to Audit Committee members. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and has accounting and related financial management expertise, and that each is an "audit committee financial expert" (as such term is defined by the SEC). 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with EY, our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communication with Audit Committees, including the quality of our accounting policies, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee also has received from EY the written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3256, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with EY its independence. 
Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Pre-Approval Policy 
Pursuant to our pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided to GATX by our independent registered public accounting firm before the firm is engaged to perform the services. Each year, the Audit Committee reviews the annual audit plan submitted by the independent registered public accounting firm and pre-approves all necessary and appropriate audit services for the year. 
Each quarter, the Company and the independent registered public accounting firm jointly provide the Audit 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Committee a report of all the audit-related, tax, and other non-audit services that were performed by the independent registered public accounting firm during the current fiscal quarter pursuant to the authority previously approved by the Committee. In addition, the Company and the independent registered public accounting firm provide the Audit Committee with an estimate of the nature and amount of the services expected to be needed in the next fiscal quarter, together with a joint statement confirming that the services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee then pre-approves those services, as appropriate. Any proposed changes to the estimate of services reviewed as part of the annual audit plan also are discussed with the Audit Committee at that time. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. Any member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
Audit and Other Related Fees 
Audit Fees 
The aggregate fees for professional services rendered by EY in connection with (i) the audit of the annual financial statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, (ii) the review of the interim financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, (iii) comfort letters, consents, and other services related to SEC filings, and (iv) related audit services provided to other subsidiaries of 
 GATX were approximately $2,571,000 for 2018 and $2,613,000 for 2017. Audit fees also include the audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by SEC rules adopted under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
Audit-Related Fees 
The aggregate fees for assurance and related services that were related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements were approximately 
 $139,000 for 2018 and $136,000 for 2017. In both years, the services performed related to employee benefit plan audits. 
Tax Fees 
The aggregate fees for professional services rendered for federal and international tax compliance, advice, and planning were approximately $43,000 for 2018 and $63,000 for 2017. 
All Other Fees 
Fees for other professional services rendered by EY were approximately $2,000 for each of 2018 and 2017, primarily related to access and use of EY's online accounting research tool.

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file with the SEC and the NYSE reports of their ownership, and any changes in ownership, of our common stock. In addition, SEC regulations require these persons to furnish us with copies of all such reports. Based solely on our review of the reports furnished to us, and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) reports were timely filed in 2018. 
Shareholder Proposals 
2019 Annual Meeting Proposals 
The Board does not know of any matters to be presented at the meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement, and we have not received notice of any shareholder proposals for the upcoming Annual Meeting. In the event that a shareholder proposal is made at the 
 Annual Meeting, the Proxyholders (as defined on page 65) may exercise their discretionary voting authority under the proxies they hold to vote in accordance with their best judgment on any such proposal. 
2020 Shareholder Proposals 
Proposals Under SEC Rule 14a-8 
In order for a shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8, the shareholder proposal must be received by the Corporate Secretary, GATX Corporation, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606-7147 no later than November 19, 2019. Any such proposal may be included in next year's proxy statement only if it complies with our By-Laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, including Rule 14a-8. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require us to include, in our proxy materials relating to any annual meeting, a shareholder proposal that does not meet all of the requirements for inclusion established by the SEC. 
Non-14a-8 Proposals 
If a shareholder intends to present a proposal for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders outside the processes of SEC Rule 14a-8, the proposal must be received by the Corporate Secretary, GATX Corporation, 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606-7147 no earlier than December 31, 2019, and no later than January 30, 2020. The notice must contain, and be accompanied by, all of the information as specified in our By-Laws.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING 
Who may vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only holders of shares of our common stock as of the close of business on March 4, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that day, 36,451,686 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and eligible to vote. Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting. 
Who can attend the Annual Meeting? 
Only holders of our common stock as of the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, will be entitled to attend the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee, you will not be admitted to the Annual Meeting unless you bring a copy of a statement (such as a brokerage statement) from your nominee reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date. 
How do I vote? 
Shareholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, then you are considered the shareholder "of record" with respect to those shares. You can vote (1) by internet or telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card, (2) signing, dating, and returning the proxy card, or (3) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee, then the nominee holding your shares is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account. Your nominee will provide you with instructions on how to vote your shares, including any available telephone or internet voting options. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other nominee and would like to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from the nominee that holds your shares. 
What does it mean to vote by proxy? 
It means that you give someone else the right to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. In this case, we are asking you to give your proxy to each of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and 
 General Counsel (the "Proxyholders"). In this way, you ensure that your vote will be counted even if you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting. 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
Shareholder of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you indicate when voting by internet or telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, or you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, the Proxyholders will vote your shares (1) FOR the election of each of the Board's nominees for director, (2) FOR the adoption of the shareholder advisory resolution to approve the 
 Company's executive compensation, and (3) FOR the ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee and you do not provide that nominee with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING 
national and regional securities exchanges, the nominee that holds your shares may generally vote on "routine" matters but cannot vote on "non-routine" matters. If your nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter at least 10 days before the Annual Meeting, your nominee will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote your shares on that matter. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote". 
Ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal No. 3) is considered a "routine" matter. A bank, broker, or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore, no broker non-votes are expected to occur in connection with Proposal No. 3. The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) and the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) are considered "non-routine" matters. A bank, broker, or other nominee cannot vote on those matters without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares, and therefore, broker non-votes may occur on Proposals 1 and 2. 
How are the votes counted? 
Our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, will serve as tabulator and will count the votes. You may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN with respect to each director nominee and on Proposals 2 and 3. If you abstain from voting on any director nominee or item, your abstention will not have an effect on the outcome of the vote. In tabulating the voting results, only FOR and AGAINST votes are counted. Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted only for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
Can I change my mind after I have voted? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by internet or by telephone only your latest internet or telephone proxy that is timely submitted prior to the meeting will be counted. If you vote by signing and returning a proxy card, you may change your vote by completing a new proxy card with a later date. You may also revoke your proxy and change your vote by attending the meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering written notice to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 233 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606-7147. 
What happens if other matters come up at the Annual Meeting? 
If any matters other than those referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting properly come before the meeting, the Proxyholders will have the discretion to vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment. 
 However, we have not received timely and proper notice from any shareholder of any other matter to be presented at the meeting. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The Annual Meeting will be held only if a quorum is present. A quorum will be present if a majority of the 36,451,686 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date are represented, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING 
How is it determined whether a matter has been approved? 
Assuming a quorum is present, each director nominee will be elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to his or her election. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast FOR the election of a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast AGAINST such director nominee's election. Under the Board's existing resignation policy, each director is expected to tender his or her resignation when nominated for election to the Board. The resignation will become effective only if the director receives more votes AGAINST his or her election than FOR votes and the Governance Committee, or other duly authorized committee of the Board, decides to accept the resignation. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect on the election of director nominees. 
Approval of Proposals 2 and 3 requires a majority of the votes cast FOR or AGAINST that proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
What shares are covered by the proxy card? 
Shareholders Who Are Not Current or Former GATX Employees. If you are not a current or former employee of GATX, the standard proxy card covers all shares held by you of record. 
Current or Former GATX Employees. If you are a current or former employee of GATX and you have shares in the GATX Stock Fund as a result of your participation in the GATX salaried or hourly 401(k) plans (collectively, the "401(k) Plans"), you will receive a separate proxy card for any shares you hold in those plans (your "Plan Shares"). This separate proxy card will cover all of your Plan Shares. Subject to applicable law, the trustee of the 401(k) Plans will vote your Plan Shares in accordance with the voting instructions you provide by completing and returning the proxy card for your Plan Shares or by voting your Plan Shares by internet or by telephone. If you do not instruct the trustee how to vote, the trustee will vote your Plan Shares in the same proportion as those Plan Shares for which the trustee receives timely voting instructions from other shareholder participants in the 401(k) Plans. To allow sufficient time for the trustee to vote your Plan Shares in accordance with your direction, your voting instructions must be received by the trustee no later than 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on April 25, 2019. Please note that the proxy card covering your Plan Shares does not cover any other GATX shares held by you outside of the 401(k) Plans, and you will need to provide separate voting instructions for your non-Plan Shares as described above. 
Who pays to prepare, mail, and solicit the proxies? 
GATX pays all the costs of preparing, mailing, and soliciting proxies. We ask brokers, banks, voting trustees, and other nominees to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners and to obtain authority to execute proxies, and we generally reimburse these brokers, banks, voting trustees, and other nominees for their expenses upon request. 
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail, and personal solicitation. For these services, we will pay D.F. King & Co., Inc. a fee of $9,500 plus expenses. In addition, certain directors, officers, or employees of the Company, who will receive no extra compensation for their services, may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, or personal contact. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
Executive Vice President, General Counsel and 
Corporate Secretary 
A director of the Company will not be considered "independent" if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Board will review all relevant facts and circumstances as to any other relationship which may exist between the Company and any director. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This Proxy Statement includes certain financial measures computed using non-GAAP components, as defined by the SEC. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and our financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We have provided a reconciliation of our non-GAAP components to the most directly comparable GAAP components. 
We exclude the effects of certain tax adjustments and other items for purposes of presenting net income, diluted earnings per share, and return on equity because we believe these items are not attributable to our business operations. Management utilizes this information when analyzing financial performance because such amounts reflect the underlying operating results that are within management's ability to influence. Accordingly, we believe presenting this information provides investors and other users of our financial statements with meaningful supplemental information for purposes of analyzing year-to-year financial performance on a comparable basis and assessing trends.
