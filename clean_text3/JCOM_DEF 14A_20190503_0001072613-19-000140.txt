March 22, PROXY STATEMENT
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
Who Is Soliciting My Vote?
The Board of Directors of j2 Global, Inc. is soliciting your vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of j2 Global's stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). In this proxy statement, j2 Global, Inc. is referred to as "j2 Global," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our."
What Will I Be Voting On?
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  A proposal to elect eight members to the j2 Global Board of Directors (see page 6);  
2.  A proposal to ratify the appointment of BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") to serve as j2 Global's independent auditors for fiscal 2019 (see page 10); and  
3.  A proposal to provide an advisory vote on the compensation of j2 Global's named executive officers (see page 11).  
[END TABLE]
How Many Votes Do I Have?
You will have one vote for every share of j2 Global common stock you owned at the close of business on March 12, 2019 (the "record date").
How Many Votes Can Be Cast By All Stockholders?
48,751,959 votes can be cast, which represents the total number of shares of j2 Global common stock that were outstanding and eligible to vote on the record date.
How Many Votes Must Be Present to Hold the Annual Meeting?
A majority of the votes that can be cast must be present to hold the meeting, or 24,375,980 votes. We urge you to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting so that we will know as soon as possible that enough votes will be present for us to hold the Annual Meeting.
What is the Required Vote to Approve Each Proposal?
For Proposal 1 – Election of Directors – to be elected to the j2 Global Board of Directors, each of the eight nominees must receive the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of j2 Global common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee). If the votes cast "for" a nominee do not exceed the votes cast "against" a nominee, pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the nominee must promptly tender his resignation for consideration by the Company's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which will recommend to the Board of Directors the action to be taken. For Proposal 2 – Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors and Proposal 3 – Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers, approval requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of shares of j2 Global common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Why Did I Receive a One-Page Notice in the Mail Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials Instead of a Full Set of Proxy Materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis.
How Can I Get Electronic Access to the Proxy Materials?
The Notice provides you with instructions regarding how to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· View our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; and  
· Instruct us to send future proxy materials to you electronically by email.  
[END TABLE]
Choosing to receive future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our annual meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it.
The Notice, proxy statement, proxy card and the 2018 Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com.
How Can I Obtain Paper or Email Copies of Proxy Materials?
The Notice contains a toll-free telephone number, an email address, and a website where stockholders can request a paper or an email copy of the proxy statement, proxy card and the 2018 Annual Report. These proxy materials are available free of charge.
Can I Vote My Shares by Filling Out and Returning the Notice?
No.  The Notice identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, but you cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to vote by Internet or how to request a paper proxy card. How Do I Vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote either in person at the Annual Meeting, by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting or as otherwise provided in this mailing. You can vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can also vote by mail or telephone pursuant to instructions provided on the proxy card.
If you own your j2 Global stock through a bank or broker, you may also vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can also vote by telephone or mail by following the instructions that the broker or nominee provides to you.
If you want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting and you hold your j2 Global stock through a bank or broker (that is, in street name), you must obtain a proxy from your bank or broker and bring that proxy to the Annual Meeting.
Can I Revoke My Proxy?
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, just send in a new proxy card with a later date or send a written notice of revocation to j2 Global's Secretary at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard, Suite 500, Los Angeles, California 90028. If you own your j2 Global stock through a bank or broker, follow the instructions provided by your bank or broker. In addition, if you are a stockholder of record, attend the Annual Meeting and want to vote in person, you can request that your previously submitted proxy not be used. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy.
What If I Vote "Abstain"?
Abstentions are counted as votes present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. An abstention has no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1 – Election of Directors. An abstention has the same effect as a vote against Proposal 2 – Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors and Proposal 3 – Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers.
What if I Don't Provide Specific Voting Instructions?
If you are a stockholder of record and return a proxy card without indicating your vote, your shares will be voted FOR the director nominees listed on the card, FOR ratification of the appointment of BDO as j2 Global's independent auditors, FOR approval of an advisory resolution approving the compensation paid to j2 Global's named executive officers, and otherwise in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting the proxy on any other matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote your shares, your bank or broker will not be able to vote your shares on certain matters scheduled to come before the Annual Meeting. Your broker is not permitted to vote your uninstructed shares on Proposal 1 – Election of Directors or Proposal 3 – Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers. Thus, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the aforementioned proposals, no votes will be cast on your behalf on such proposals. Your broker will, however, continue to have discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on Proposal 2 – Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors. If your bank or broker does not have discretion to vote your shares held in street name on a particular proposal and you don't give your broker instructions on how to vote your shares, or your broker has such discretion but does not exercise it, the votes will be broker non-votes, which will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for Proposal 1 – Election of Directors, Proposal 2 – Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors, or Proposal 3 – Advisory Vote on the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers.
If you are the owner of record, and you do not vote your shares held in your name, your shares will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for transaction of business at the Annual Meeting, and no votes will be cast on your behalf on any of the items of business at the Annual Meeting.
What Happens if the Annual Meeting is Postponed or Adjourned?
Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted.
Who Can I Contact if I Have Questions Concerning the Annual Meeting?
If you have any further questions about voting your shares or attending the Annual Meeting, or wish to obtain directions to the Annual Meeting, please call or email j2 Global's Investor Relations Department at 800-577-1790 or investor@j2global.com.

j2 Global urges stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 24 of this proxy statement, which describes in more detail how j2 Global's executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve its compensation goals, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative, appearing on pages 38 through 47, which provide detailed information on the compensation of j2 Global's named executive officers.

Board Leadership
We separate the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board in recognition of the different responsibilities fulfilled by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board at j2 Global. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for j2 Global and for the day-to-day leadership and performance of j2 Global, while the Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and sets the agenda for, and presides over, meetings of the Board of Directors.
Director Independence j2 Global's Board of Directors has determined that all of our directors, other than our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Shah, are independent within the meaning of the rules of the SEC and the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Communications with the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee
The Board of Directors welcomes communications from stockholders and has adopted a procedure for receiving and addressing them. Interested parties may also submit complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters to j2 Global's Audit Committee. Stockholders may send written communications to the entire Board of Directors, to the Audit Committee or to individual members, addressing them to j2 Global, Inc., 6922 Hollywood Boulevard, Suite 500, Los Angeles, California 90028, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Communications by e-mail should be addressed to investor@j2global.com and marked "Attention: Corporate Secretary" in the "Subject" field.
The Board of Directors has instructed the Secretary to review all communications so received (via e-mail or otherwise), and to exercise his discretion not to forward to members of the Board of Directors correspondence that is inappropriate, such as business solicitations, frivolous communications, advertising, routine business matters (i.e., business inquiries, complaints or suggestions) and personal grievances. However, any director may at any time request the Secretary to forward any and all communications received by the Secretary but not forwarded to the Board of Directors.
Risk Management

The Audit Committee oversees the process by which j2 Global's senior management and the relevant departments assess and manage j2 Global's exposure to, and management of, financial risks. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board of Directors and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed about such risks.
MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Miller, Ross and Kretzmer, who is the Chairman of the Committee. The Audit Committee is comprised solely of directors who meet all the independence standards for audit committee members as set forth in SOX, the rules of the SEC adopted pursuant to SOX and the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the SEC rules adopted pursuant to SOX and has accounting or related financial management expertise, in each case in accordance with the rules of the SEC and the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, retaining and overseeing j2 Global's independent auditors, approving the services performed by them and reviewing j2 Global's financial reports and reporting process, accounting principles and its system of internal accounting controls.

The Compensation Committee's charter does not provide for the delegation of the Compensation Committee's responsibilities. See the "Compensation Committee Report" below.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee currently consists of Ms. Fay and Messrs. Miller and Bech, who is the Chairman of the Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other things:

· evaluating the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees.  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has not established specific minimum age, education, experience or skill requirements for potential director nominees. In selecting director nominees, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee takes into consideration various factors to find candidates that will be able to represent the interests of the stockholders, including judgment, skill, diversity, integrity, educational background, experience with businesses and other organizations of a comparable size, the interplay of the candidate's experience with that of the other members of the Board  of Directors and the extent to which a candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board of Directors and any committees of the Board of Directors. Although the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee endeavors to seek nominees representing diverse experience in policy-making positions in business and technology, and in areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates the diversity in experience of its directors annually in recommending the slate of nominees to the full Board of Directors, and j2 Global believes that the current Board of Directors reflects the diversity of experience it seeks.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may consider candidates proposed by management or by stockholders, but is not limited to such candidates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates director candidates recommended by stockholders in the same way that it evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. j2 Global sets forth its policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by stockholders in its Bylaws. See "Deadline for Submitting Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for the Next Annual Meeting" for more information regarding the procedures for the consideration of any director candidates recommended by stockholders.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires j2 Global's officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)), directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of j2 Global's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish j2 Global with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on j2 Global's review of the copies of such forms received by j2 Global and written representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements, j2 Global believes that all filing requirements applicable to j2 Global's officers, directors and 10% stockholders were complied with during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our executive compensation programs for our fiscal year 2018 named executive officers who were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Vivek Shah, our Chief Executive Officer;  
· R. Scott Turicchi, our President and Chief Financial Officer;  
· Jeremy D. Rossen, our Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and  
· Steve Dunn, our Chief Accounting Officer.  
[END TABLE]
General
The Compensation Committee of j2 Global's Board of Directors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· administers j2 Global's compensation programs, including its stock-based compensation plans;  
· recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation to be paid to j2 Global's executives;  
· recommends to the Board of Directors changes to j2 Global's compensation policies and benefit programs; and  
· otherwise seeks to ensure that j2 Global's compensation philosophy is consistent with j2 Global's best interests and is properly implemented.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee currently is comprised of four non-employee directors whom the Board of Directors has determined meet the independence requirements for compensation committee membership set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives j2 Global's executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate j2 Global's executive officers in a manner that is tied directly to achievement of j2 Global's overall operating and financial goals, and thereby increase j2 Global's overall equity value. The Compensation Committee reviews j2 Global's compensation strategy annually. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee considers whether j2 Global's current compensation programs should be modified and whether new programs or elements of compensation should be introduced in order to better meet j2 Global's overall compensation objectives.
j2 Global's Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal policy for allocating compensation between long-term and short-term, between cash and non-cash or among different forms of non-cash compensation. Rather, the Compensation Committee assesses past performance and anticipated future contribution of each senior executive and recommends to the Board of Directors the total amount and mix of each element of compensation.  In addition, the Committee believes that the most senior executives should have their compensation more heavily weighted toward equity compensation.
In setting compensation for any given year, the Compensation Committee considers the amount of compensation from prior periods or amounts realizable from prior compensation. j2 Global's compensation objective is to link compensation to improvements in corporate performance and increases in stockholder value. j2 Global's executive compensation program goals include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to establish pay levels that attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executive officers, while considering the overall market competitiveness for such executive talent and balancing the relationship between total stockholder return and direct compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to align executive officer remuneration with the interests of stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to recognize superior individual performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to balance base and incentive compensation to complement j2 Global's annual and longer-term business objectives and strategies and encourage the fulfillment of those objectives and strategies through executive officer performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· to provide compensation opportunities based on j2 Global's performance.  
[END TABLE]
Say-on-Pay Vote
At j2 Global's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 3, 2018, the Company held a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. j2 Global's stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of the named executive officers, with more than 97% of stockholder votes cast in favor of the Company's say-on-pay proposal. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms the stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation and, as a result, the Compensation Committee decided to retain its general approach to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.
Stockholder-Friendly Features of Our Executive Compensation Program
The following are highlights of our compensation programs, which continue to contain stockholder-friendly features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We pay for performance.  The vesting of approximately 50% of the equity awards granted to our executive officers each year is tied to the performance of the Company's common stock price and the annual incentive cash compensation paid to our executive officers is based on our financial performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We seek independent advice. We engage independent consultants to review executive compensation and provide advice to the Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We have significant stock retention requirements.  We maintain a stock ownership policy for our executive officers and directors. Our Chief Executive Officer is required to own 5x his base salary in Company stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers.  None of our executive officers are party to an employment agreement with the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We do not allow hedging or pledging. Our policies prohibit the hedging and pledging of Company stock by directors and officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Role of Compensation Committee Consultant in Establishing Compensation
The Compensation Committee considers from time to time the market compensation of similarly-situated executives at other companies and periodically purchases third-party compensation surveys or engages third-party compensation consultants to assist in providing comparative compensation data. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer to prepare a competitive analysis of the Company's current executive compensation programs that addressed j2 Global on a consolidated basis (the "2018 Compensation Report"). As part of its analysis, Pearl Meyer selected and proposed companies for inclusion in a comparison group (the "Peer Group"). The "Peer Group" was comprised of the following companies that operated in the internet software and services industry and other related technology companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ANGI Homeservices Inc.   Match Group, Inc.   RingCentral, Inc.  
 CoStar Group, Inc.   Nuance Communications, Inc.   The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.  
 GoDaddy Inc.   Nutanix, Inc.   TripAdvisor, Inc.  
 Groupon, Inc.   Open Text Corporation   Zillow Group, Inc.  
 IAC/InterActiveCorp   Pandora Media, Inc.    
 LogMeIn, Inc.   Proofpoint, Inc.    
[END TABLE]
The 2018 Compensation Report was presented to the Compensation Committee in April 2018. The 2018 Compensation Report helped clarify the relevance of the companies used in the Peer Group, and informed our decisions with respect to executive compensation for fiscal 2018.
The Compensation Committee recognizes that it is essential to receive objective advice from its external advisors. Consequently, the Compensation Committee is solely responsible for retaining and terminating Pearl Meyer, Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee and Pearl Meyer did not provide any other services to j2 Global during fiscal 2018.
Components of Our Executive Compensation Program
The components of the compensation program for our named executive officers are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· base salary;  
· incentive cash compensation;  
· long-term equity incentive compensation;  
· employee stock purchase plan; and  
· employee retirement, health and welfare benefits and other compensation.  
[END TABLE]
 Each of these components is described in further detail in the narrative that follows.
Base Salary. Base salary is the fixed portion of executive pay and is set to reward individuals' current contributions to j2 Global and compensate them for their expected day-to-day performance. Base salaries are evaluated annually for all executive officers. In determining appropriate salary levels for the executive officers generally, the Compensation Committee considers, among other factors, the officer's scope of responsibility, prior experience and past performance, and data on prevailing compensation levels in relevant markets for executive talent.
The Compensation Committee generally targets executive salaries near the median percentile for comparable positions at comparable companies based upon third-party compensation survey information, including the 2018 Compensation Report. In determining 2018 base salaries, the Compensation Committee considered a number of factors including the information in the 2018 Compensation Report, together with various other factors such as Company performance and general economic conditions, among others.
In September 2017, the Board appointed Vivek Shah, the former Chief Executive Officer of Ziff Davis, LLC, one of our subsidiaries, as Chief Executive Officer of j2 Global, effective January 1, 2018.  Upon assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Shah received an annual salary of $1,000,000.
Based on the factors described above, in May 2018 the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the following increases to the base salaries of the named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     Previous Base Salary     New Base Salary  
 R. Scott Turicchi     $660,000     $750,000  
 Jeremy D. Rossen     $405,000     $425,000  
 Steve P. Dunn     $290,000     $305,000  
[END TABLE]
Incentive Cash Compensation.  j2 Global has established an executive bonus program (the "Senior Management Bonus Program") for awarding cash bonuses to j2 Global's senior executives, including the named executive officers. Bonus guidelines under the Senior Management Bonus Program are established each year and are designed to encourage and reward senior management for (a) attaining company-wide financial goals, (b) improving the financial and operational health of j2 Global and (c) meeting or exceeding individually defined goals and objectives. The Senior Management Bonus Program provides guidelines only as to payment of bonuses to executive program participants, is non-binding, and does not create any contract right between j2 Global and the participants.
The process for determining bonuses under the Senior Management Bonus Program relies on the development of corporate financial targets.  In addition, individual goals and objectives are set for each program participant except the Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer, who bear ultimate responsibility for achievement of the corporate financial targets and the budget.  The financial objectives are generally in alignment with j2 Global's budget for the year, which budget is used as a basis for j2 Global's public disclosures regarding its expected annual financial performance. The individual goals and objectives are designed to help j2 Global achieve its financial goals. The corporate financial objectives are recommended by the Compensation Committee for approval by the Board of Directors. Under the Senior Management Bonus Program established for fiscal 2018 (the "2018 Senior Management Bonus Plan"), j2 Global established a "bonus pool" based upon an aggregate of specified percentages of base salary of all eligible executives, ranging from 25% to 100%. For Mr. Shah, the "target" bonus percentage was 100% of his base salary. For Mr. Turicchi, Mr. Rossen and Mr. Dunn, the "target" bonuses were $750,000, $235,000 and $165,000, respectively.  These percentages and amounts were determined based on the named executive officers' relative level of responsibility, size and complexity of the job, past contributions to j2 Global's performance and expected contributions to j2 Global's future success.  They are also based on the executive's articulated goals and objectives, as well as the market compensation of similarly-situated executives at other companies, as reflected in third-party compensation surveys, including the 2018 Compensation Report. However, the Compensation Committee retained the discretion to award bonus percentages higher or lower than these targets based on the overall plan funding level and the Committee's subjective assessment of each individual's achievement of his or her individual goals and objectives, as applicable.
The target adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income ("Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income") in respect of the 2018 Senior Management Bonus Plan was $309,200,000 (the "2018 Target"). The 2018 Senior Management Bonus Plan provided that the bonus pool would be "funded" only if j2 Global achieved at least a minimum of 90% of the 2018 Target. Such amount would be calculated by taking j2 Global's consolidated GAAP net income, adding back any non-cash compensation expense, non-recurring one-time charges, depreciation and amortization, and deducting any non-recurring income or income recorded in the fiscal year of 2018 relating to a previous year, all items net of tax. If at least 90% of the 2018 Target was achieved, the bonus pool for 2018 could be funded at between 0% and 185% of the target pool amount, or between $0 and $4,165,121, depending on the actual percentage of the 2018 Target achieved. The bonus pool for 2018 was capped at 185% if more than $335,482,000 of Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Income was achieved. Notwithstanding the achievement of the 2018 Senior Management Bonus Plan criteria, the Compensation Committee retained discretion to increase or decrease the funding of the bonus pool based on factors it deemed appropriate.
Once the bonus pool was funded, individual bonuses were to be established by evaluating each executive's relative contribution to the success of j2 Global as a whole, as well as his or her success in meeting his or her individual objectives. Individual bonus amounts were to be recommended by the Compensation Committee for approval by the Board of Directors.
On February 6, 2019, the Compensation Committee recommended for approval by the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, funding the pool established under the 2018 Senior Management Bonus Plan (the "2018 Pool") at the 78.3% level based upon the program formula. On February 7, 2019, the Board of Directors approved the Compensation Committee's recommendation to award the following bonuses from the 2018 Pool to the named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     Target Bonus     Percent of Target Bonus Paid    2018 Bonus Payment (paid in 2019)

 Steve P. Dunn     $165,000     78.3%     $129,195  
[END TABLE]
 approved in 2015. The Supplemental Plan was designed to further incentivize the most senior executives, who are ultimately responsible for j2 Global's performance, to achieve j2 Global's financial goals and improve its financial and operational health. The Supplemental Plan was adopted in recognition of the increased level of responsibility that the participants assumed in light of the continued growth of j2 Global, and the increased expectations of these executives to continue to innovate and grow and promote j2 Global's vision. Under the Supplemental Plan, the President and Chief Financial Officer was eligible to receive an additional 25% of his base salary in any year in which the Senior Management Bonus Plan was funded in an amount representing achievement of at least 90% of the target value.
Awards under the Supplemental Plan were determined on the date on which the level of funding of the Senior Management Bonus Plan was determined (the "Determination Date"), and were to be paid out in three equal annual installments on or around the first, second and third anniversary of the applicable Determination Date. Payments were to be made only if the recipients were active employees of the Company on the date of distribution. Notwithstanding the achievement of the funding criteria under the Supplemental Plan, the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors reserved the right to increase or decrease the amount payable under the Supplemental Plan as they deemed appropriate under the circumstances.  The Supplemental Plan was discontinued in 2015, following the approval of the annual installments in respect of the 2014 Supplemental Plan year by the Board of Directors in February 2015.  All amounts approved by the Board prior to the discontinuance, have been paid on such dates as required by the Supplemental Plan.
The following table describes the installments previously paid to Mr. Turicchi under the Supplemental Plan.

In fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee adopted a policy whereby restricted stock issued to senior executive officers, including the named executive officers, vest with respect to (i) 50% of the restricted shares granted, ratably over the five-year vesting period, with awards vesting one-fifth on each of the first five anniversaries of the date of the award provided that the recipient is still employed by j2 Global at the applicable vesting date ("time vesting restricted shares"), and (ii) the remaining 50% of the restricted shares granted, with respect to one-fifth of such shares at each such time as j2 Common Stock remains at or above the following stock prices for at least 20 consecutive trading days: $75, $85, $95, $105 and $115 ("performance restricted shares"); provided that in the case of performance restricted shares (x) no such shares shall vest prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant, whether or not any stock price condition is satisfied prior to such time and (y) the recipient is still employed by j2 Global at the applicable vesting date.
In fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee continued with its policy of issuing 50% time vesting restricted shares and 50% performance restricted shares.  However, with respect to the performance restricted shares, the Board changed (i) the stock price targets required to vest over the five-year vesting period to $100, $110, $120, $130 and $140, and (ii) the determination of such stock price target achievement requiring the maintenance of such stock price target for 20 out of 30 trading days in addition to requiring the average closing price for such 30 day period to equal or exceed such stock price target.
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee continued with its policy of issuing 50% time vesting restricted shares and 50% performance restricted shares.  However, with respect to the performance restricted shares, the Board changed (i) the stock price targets required to vest over the five-year vesting period to $87.20, $95.05, $103.60, $112.93 and $123.09, and (ii) the determination of such stock price target achievement requiring the maintenance of such stock price target for 20 out of 30 trading days.
Mr. Shah was awarded an upfront long-term equity award, effective January 1, 2018 under the Company's 2015 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") consisting of 400,000 stock options, 400,000 performance-based restricted shares, and 200,000 time-based restricted shares (the "Shah Equity Award")  to incentivize Mr. Shah during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer. The exercise price of the stock options is equal to $75.03, the fair market value of a share of Company common stock on January 1, 2018. The stock options and time-based restricted shares will vest in eight equal installments on each of the eight anniversaries of January 1, 2018 (the "Shah Grant Date"). The performance-based restricted share award will vest in one-eighth increments only if the Company's common stock price remains at or above the following eight stock prices for at least 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period and the average closing price for such 30 day period is equal to or exceeds such stock price threshold: $83.93, $93.88, $105.01, $117.47, $131.40, $146.98, $164.41 and $183.90; provided that no shares will vest before the second anniversary of the Shah Grant Date.  The stock price thresholds with respect to Mr. Shah's performance-based restricted shares are based on the compounded annual growth rate in the Company's common stock price from the date of its initial public offering until the Shah Grant Date, as applied to each of the eight successive stock price thresholds. The Shah Equity Award is otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the individual award agreements thereunder corresponding to the awards.  The dollar value of the long-term equity incentive award for Mr. Shah is $43,250,000, or 5,406,250 per year over the eight year term (assuming a value for the stock option awards based on the grant date fair value of such awards and performance restricted shares based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions).
In fiscal 2018, the following stock-based compensation awards were made to the named executive officers (the "2018 Awards") (assuming a value for the stock option awards based on the grant date fair value of such awards and performance restricted shares based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions):

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. j2 Global offers all of its employees, including j2 Global's executive officers, the opportunity to purchase j2 Global's common stock through a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). Under the ESPP, eligible employees can withhold up to 15% of their earnings, up to certain maximums, to be used to purchase shares of j2 Global's common stock at certain plan-defined dates. The price of j2 Global common stock purchased under the ESPP for the offering periods is equal to 85% of the lesser of its fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period.
Other Compensation. j2 Global's executive officers are entitled to participate in j2 Global's health, vision, dental, life and disability insurance plans, j2 Global's innovation and patent award program and j2 Global's tax-qualified 401(k) plan, to the same extent as j2 Global's other employees. However, j2 Global provided certain additional benefits to executives.  j2 Global's innovation and patent award program provides monetary incentives for participants who submit patent ideas to the Company, or file patent applications with, or are granted patents by, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Participants in the 401(k) plan are eligible to receive an annual company match up to $1,000, which vests over a three-year period. Change in Control and Severance Arrangements. j2 Global has not provided change of control or severance arrangements to any of its executive officers, other than as set forth below.
 Our executive officers are eligible to receive benefits in the event their employment is terminated (1) following a change in control and (2) upon their retirement, disability or death. The amount of benefits will vary based on the reason for the termination.  
In the event of a change of control of j2 Global, each option granted under the 2007 Stock Plan will become immediately exercisable in full and all outstanding restrictions on each share of restricted stock and each restricted stock unit awarded under these plans will immediately lapse in full, in each case unless the Board of Directors determines that the holder has been offered substantially identical replacement options, shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units, as the case may be, and a comparable position at the acquiring company. With respect to the 2015 Stock Plan, unless the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors determines otherwise at the time of grant, in the event a participant's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or a participant resigns for good cause, in each case during the twenty-four month period following a change in control, each option granted under the 2015 Stock Plan will become immediately exercisable in full and all outstanding restrictions on each share of restricted stock, including time and performance based restrictions, and each restricted stock unit awarded under the 2015 Stock Plan will immediately lapse in full.  Moreover, the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors may provide for awards under the 2015 Stock Plan to be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in connection with a change in control.
In the event that a participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries terminates as a result of his or her death, disability, retirement or if the participant dies during the three-month period after the termination of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, and at the time of his or her death, disability or retirement, the participant was entitled to exercise an option granted to him or her, such option shall, unless the applicable option agreement provides otherwise, expire one year after the date of his or her death, but in no event later than the expiration date of the option.  During such one-year period the option may be exercised by the participant's executor or administrator or by any person or persons who shall have acquired the option directly from the participant by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent that the participant was entitled to exercise the option at the date of his or her death and, to the extent the option is not so exercised, it shall expire and no longer be exercisable at the end of such one-year period. "Retirement" for purposes of the stock option agreement is defined as the termination of employment of the participant if (1) on the effective date of the termination of employment (the "Termination Date"), (i) the participant has reached the age of 65 on or before the Termination Date, and the Termination Date is not less than six (6) months following the date of the restricted stock agreement; or (ii) the participant has reached the age of 60 on or before the Termination Date and has completed not less than ten (10) years of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries and (2) the participant has provided the Company with at least 12 months' advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and the participant remains continuously employed with the Company or its subsidiaries during such 12 month period.
In the event that a participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries terminates as a result of his or her death, retirement or permanent disability, then (1) all outstanding restrictions on each time vesting restricted share shall lapse on the later of (i) the date of such event, or (ii) the first anniversary of the date of the restricted stock agreement related thereto and (2) the continued employment conditions shall lapse on the performance vesting restricted shares and the performance vesting restricted shares shall be eligible to meet the stock price performance conditions during the 36 months following the termination of employment (after which any unvested performance vesting restricted shares will be forfeited), provided that (x) such 36 month period is subject to and shall not extend the expiration date of the performance vesting restricted shares, and (y) no restrictions on performance vesting restricted shares  shall lapse prior to the date that is the one year anniversary of the date of the restricted stock agreement related thereto.  "Retirement" for purposes of the restricted stock agreement is defined as the termination of employment of the participant if (1) on the effective date of the termination of employment (the "Termination Date"), (i) the participant has reached the age of 65 on or before the Termination Date, and the Termination Date is not less than six (6) months following the date of the restricted stock agreement; or (ii) the participant has reached the age of 60 on or before the Termination Date and has completed not less than ten (10) years of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries and (2) the participant has provided the Company with at least 12 months' advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and the participant remains continuously employed with the Company or its subsidiaries during such 12 month period.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We have had stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers and other executives since 2016.  The targeted stock ownership requirements were established as a multiple of base salary.  For Mr. Shah, the targeted stock ownership level is five times base salary.  For Mr. Turicchi, the targeted stock ownership level is four times base salary.  For Messrs. Rossen and Dunn, the targeted stock ownership level is three times base salary.  Each individual subject to our stock ownership guidelines has five years from the date their target level was established to meet the guidelines.
Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging Transactions
The Board of Directors has adopted an anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy that prohibits officers and directors from engaging in transactions that would allow such officer or director to continue to own the Company's common stock without taking on the full risks and rewards of stock ownership. The Board of Directors believes that when such transactions occur, those directors or officers engaged in any such transactions may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other stockholders under such circumstances and, therefore, the Company's insider trading policies prohibit the Company's employees and directors from (i) purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's common stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds; (ii) engaging in short sales related to the Company's common stock; (iii) placing standing orders; (iv) maintaining margin accounts; and (v) pledging the Company's securities as collateral for a loan. Summary
After its review of all existing programs, consideration of current market and competitive conditions and alignment with j2 Global's overall compensation objectives and philosophy, the Compensation Committee believes that the total compensation program for j2 Global's executive officers is focused on increasing value for stockholders and enhancing j2 Global's performance. The Compensation Committee currently believes that, although it does not target a specific percentage as being incentive compensation, a significant portion of compensation of executive officers is properly tied to stock appreciation or stockholder value through stock-based compensation awards and annual cash incentive bonus measures. j2 Global's Compensation Committee believes that its executive compensation levels are competitive with the compensation programs offered by other corporations with which it competes for executive talent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of j2 Global's filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, that might incorporate future filings, including this proxy statement, in whole or in part, the following Compensation Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "Soliciting Material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filings under the Securities Act or Exchange Act whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in such filings.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Management of j2 Global has prepared the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed it with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the proxy statement for j2 Global's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,

Stephen Ross PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer ("PEO"). The Company's PEO for 2018 is Mr. Shah. Set forth below is our median employee's annual total compensation (excluding Mr. Shah), Mr. Shah's annual total compensation and the ratio of these amounts:
Median Employee annual total compensation (excluding our PEO): $79,824
Mr. Shah, our PEO, annual total compensation: $45,062,153
Ratio of PEO to Median Employee Compensation: 564.52:1.0
Alternative CEO Pay Ratio Annualizing the Shah Equity Award
As discussed under Compensation Discussion & Analysis, "Components of Our Executive Compensation Program – Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation," in connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Shah was awarded the Shah Equity Award as an up-front long-term equity award to incentivize Mr. Shah during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer.  The Shah Equity Award is comprised of stock options and time-vesting restricted stock that vest ratably over eight years and performance-vesting restricted stock that vests in 1/8 increments based on specified stock price targets of the Company's common stock.  The annualized dollar value of the Shah Equity Award over eight years is $5,406,250.
If the CEO Pay Ratio is calculated using the annualized amount of the Shah Equity Award for purposes of Mr. Shah's long-term equity incentive compensation for 2018, the alternative CEO Pay Ratio is as follows:
Median Employee annual total compensation (excluding our PEO): $79,824
Mr. Shah, our PEO, annual total compensation: $7,218,403
Ratio of PEO to Median Employee Compensation: 90.43:1.0
The alternative CEO Pay Ratio presented above is not a substitute for the CEO Pay Ratio but we believe that it is helpful in fully evaluating the ratio of Mr. Shah's annual total compensation to that of our median employee.
Background
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 2,589 persons for some or all of the year.  In determining the median employee, the Company prepared a listing of all employees as of December 31, 2018 on an anonymous basis and included all income that was reportable to the applicable taxing authority in the jurisdiction in which each such employee was employed.  For example, in the United States, the Company used each employee's income reflected on Form W-2. For those employed less than the full year, the Company has annualized the employees' compensation.  We selected the median amount from this list. The Company then determined the annual total compensation of the median employee using the same methodology used in determining the PEO's annual total compensation as provided in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below. The pay ratio (without the annualized Shah Equity Award) is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. COMPENSATION RISK
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees, including executive and non-executive officers, and determined that j2 Global's compensation programs do not give rise to risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee noted several design features of j2 Global's cash and equity incentive programs for all executive officers in particular that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The program design provides a balanced mix of cash and equity, annual and longer-term incentives, and performance metrics (earnings and total stockholder return);  
· There is a significant weighting towards long-term incentive compensation that discourages short-term risk taking;  
· Goals are appropriately set to avoid targets that, if not achieved, result in a large percentage loss of compensation; and  
· The maximum funding level of the Senior Management Bonus Program was capped at 185% of target for 2018, and will be capped at 185% of target for 2019.

Bech, Cresci and Ross, and Ms. Fay served on the Compensation Committee during 2018. j2 Global has no interlocking relationships or other transactions involving any of its Compensation Committee members that are required to be reported pursuant to applicable SEC rules.

 (1)   Amounts reported in this column represent compensation earned in the year in which they were reported and were paid in the following fiscal year.  
 (2)   These amounts represent the grant date fair value under ASC 718 for restricted stock awards granted and report a grant date value for the performance restricted shares based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The ASC 718 value as of the grant date for stock awards is spread over the number of months of service required for the grant to become non-forfeitable. There can be no assurance that the ASC 718 amount will ever be realized. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts for awards granted are included in Note 14, "Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan" to the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, included in j2 Global's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019. Assuming the achievement of all performance conditions, the value of the 2018 performance restricted shares at the grant date would be: $30,012,000 for Mr. Shah; $1,499,985 for Mr. Turicchi; $363,008 for Mr. Rossen; and $258,482 for Mr. Dunn.  The value of the 2017 performance restricted shares reported last year was based on the achievement of all performance conditions and has been revised in the table above to report the value at the grant date based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions.  Assuming the achievement of all performance conditions, the value of the 2017 performance restricted shares at the grant date would be: $1,224,960 for Mr. Shah; $1,249,941 for Mr. Turicchi; $337,511 for Mr. Rossen; and $237,498 for Mr. Dunn.  Assuming the achievement of all performance conditions, the value of the 2016 performance restricted shares at the grant date would be: $999,987 for Mr. Shah; $1,124,962 for Mr. Turicchi; $277,480 for Mr. Rossen; and $198,965 for Mr. Dunn.  
 (3)   These amounts represent the grant date fair value under ASC 718 for stock option awards granted. The ASC 718 value as of the grant date for stock option awards is spread over the vesting period. There can be no assurance that the ASC 718 amount will ever be realized.  Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts for stock options granted in 2015 are included in Note 14 "Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan" to the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, included in j2 Global's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2019.

[END TABLE]
Potential Post-Employment Payments
Our executive officers are eligible to receive benefits in the event their employment is terminated (1) following a change in control and (2) upon their retirement, disability or death. The amount of benefits will vary based on the reason for the termination.
The following sections present calculations as of December 31, 2018 of the estimated benefits our executive officers would receive in these situations. Although the calculations are intended to provide reasonable estimates of the potential benefits, they are based on numerous assumptions and may not represent the actual amount an executive would receive if an eligible termination event were to occur.  
Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control j2 Global has not provided change of control or severance arrangements to any of its executive officers, except as provided below.
In the event of a change of control of j2 Global, each option granted under the 2007 Stock Plan will become immediately vested and exercisable in full and all outstanding restrictions on each share of restricted stock and each restricted stock unit shall immediately be canceled in full unless the Board of Directors determines that the holder has been offered substantially identical replacement options, replacement shares of restricted stock or replacement restricted stock units, as the case may be, and a comparable position at the acquiring company. With respect to the 2015 Stock Plan, unless the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors determines otherwise at the time of grant, in the event a participant's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or a participant resigns for good reason, in each case during the twenty-four month period following a change in control, each option  granted under the 2015 Stock Plan will become immediately exercisable in full and all outstanding restrictions on each share of restricted stock, including time and performance based restrictions, and each restricted stock unit awarded under the 2015 Stock Plan will immediately lapse in full.  Moreover, the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors may provide for awards under the 2015 Stock Plan to be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment in connection with a change in control.
As of December 31, 2018, the named executive officers would have realized the following gains from the acceleration of unvested stock options, measured by the difference between the closing price of j2 Global common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 31, 2018, or $69.38, and the option grant price, multiplied by the number of options that remain subject to vesting: Vivek Shah – $0; R. Scott Turicchi – $18,676.
In addition, the named executive officers would have realized the following gains from the acceleration of unvested restricted stock, measured by multiplying the number of unvested restricted shares by the closing price of j2 Global common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 31, 2018, or $69.38: Vivek Shah – $44,612,450; R. Scott Turicchi – $6,857,103; Jeremy D. Rossen – $1,993,426; and Steve P. Dunn – $1,277,702.  
Payments Upon Death, Disability or Retirement  
In the event that a participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries terminates as a result of his or her death, disability, retirement or if the participant dies during the three-month period after the termination of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries, and at the time of his or her death, disability or retirement, the participant was entitled to exercise an option granted to him or her, such option shall, unless the applicable option agreement provides otherwise, expire one year after the date of his or her death, but in no event later than the expiration date of the option.  During such one-year period the option may be exercised by the participant's executor or administrator or by any person or persons who shall have acquired the option directly from the participant by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent that the participant was entitled to exercise the option at the date of his or her death and, to the extent the option is not so exercised, it shall expire and no longer be exercisable at the end of such one-year period. "Retirement" for purposes of the stock option agreement is defined as the termination of employment of the participant if (1) on the effective date of the termination of employment (the "Termination Date"), (i) the participant has reached the age of 65 on or before the Termination Date, and the Termination Date is not less than six (6) months following the date of the restricted stock agreement; or (ii) the participant has reached the age of 60 on or before the Termination Date and has completed not less than ten (10) years of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries and (2) the participant has provided the Company with at least 12 months' advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and the participant remains continuously employed with the Company or its subsidiaries during such 12 month period.
In the event that a participant's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries terminates as a result of his or her death, retirement or permanent disability, then (1) all outstanding restrictions on each time vesting restricted share shall lapse on the later of (i) the date of such event, or (ii) the first anniversary of the date of the restricted stock agreement related thereto and (2) the continued employment conditions shall lapse on the performance vesting restricted shares and the performance vesting restricted shares shall be eligible to meet the stock price performance conditions during the 36 months following the termination of employment (after which any unvested performance vesting restricted shares will be forfeited), provided that (x) such 36 month period is subject to and shall not extend the expiration date of the performance vesting restricted shares, and (y) no restrictions on performance vesting restricted shares shall lapse prior to the date that is the one year anniversary of the date of the restricted stock agreement related thereto.  "Retirement" for purposes of the restricted stock agreement is defined as the termination  of employment of the participant if (1) on the effective date of the termination of employment (the "Termination Date"), (i) the participant has reached the age of 65 on or before the Termination Date, and the Termination Date is not less than six (6) months following the date of the restricted stock agreement; or (ii) the participant has reached the age of 60 on or before the Termination Date and has completed not less than ten (10) years of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries and (2) the participant has provided the Company with at least 12 months' advance written notice of his or her intention to retire and the participant remains continuously employed with the Company or its subsidiaries during such 12 month period.
As of December 31, 2018, upon the named executive officer's death, retirement or permanent disability, each of the named executive officers would have realized the following gains from the acceleration of unvested time vesting restricted stock, measured by multiplying the number of unvested time vesting restricted shares subject to acceleration by the closing price of j2 Global common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 31, 2018, or $69.38: Vivek Shah – $1,399,048; R. Scott Turicchi – $2,636,093; Jeremy D. Rossen – $941,834; and Steve P. Dunn – $530,063. These amounts do not include time vesting restricted shares granted to each of the named executive officers in 2018, which restricted shares would vest on the one year anniversary of the grant date.  The named executive officers' performance vesting restricted stock will remain outstanding and eligible to vest as described in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of j2 Global's filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act that might incorporate future filings, including this proxy statement, in whole or in part, the following Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "Soliciting Material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC and shall not be incorporated by reference into any filings under the Securities Act or Exchange Act whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in such filings.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
j2 Global's management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements and for the public reporting process. BDO, j2 Global's independent auditor for 2018, was responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of j2 Global's 2018 audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of j2 Global's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed j2 Global's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. As part of this review for fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met privately with BDO and j2 Global's internal auditors to discuss the Company's financial statements and disclosures, accounting policies and their application, internal controls over financial reporting, and other matters of importance to the Audit Committee, BDO or the internal auditors.
In this context, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and BDO the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, j2 Global's internal control over financial reporting and BDO's evaluation of j2 Global's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with BDO the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from BDO required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding BDO's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with BDO that firm's independence. The Audit Committee concluded that BDO's provision of audit and non-audit services to j2 Global and its affiliates through December 31, 2018, was compatible with BDO's independence.
Based on the considerations referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to j2 Global's Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, be included in j2 Global's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018.

Availability of Representatives of Independent Accountant at the Annual Meeting
Representatives of BDO are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, and will have the opportunity to make a statement at the meeting if they desire to do so. In addition, they are expected to be available at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions.
Pre-Approval Procedure for Services
The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services. Requests for the independent auditors to provide any services to j2 Global must be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the independent auditors and the Chief Financial Officer and must be pre-approved. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
j2 Global has adopted a written policy requiring disclosure by certain employees, including all executive officers, of all transactions involving j2 Global, if the employee or a family member, significant other, employer or close associate will receive a benefit or gain. All such transactions are reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and/or President and/or the Board of Directors, as appropriate. The employee with an interest in the transaction may be asked to recuse himself or herself from any discussion and/or final decision relating to the transaction and/or any oversight of any ongoing relationship associated with such transaction.
Any proposed transactions requiring disclosure as discussed above may only proceed or continue if j2 Global determines that it will realize at least the same business advantage from the transaction as it would from operating at arms-length with any third party or, alternatively, that the transaction does not represent an actual conflict of interest.
In addition, j2 Global's Board of Directors has a policy that all transactions between a Board member or family member of a Board member and j2 Global be approved by a majority of members of the Board of Directors with the interested Board member recusing himself from such vote.
In addition, the j2 Global Board of Directors has adopted a written policy governing the approval of Related-Party Transactions (the "RPT Policy"). "Related-Party Transactions" include any transaction or relationship directly or indirectly involving a director or director nominee, executive officer, a 5% stockholder of the Company or any person known by the Company to be an immediate family member of any of the foregoing individuals that would need to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Such transactions do not include, however, indemnification payments, ordinary course business expenses or reimbursements or compensation paid to directors and executive officers for their services as directors and executive officers.
The RPT Policy prohibits all Related-Party Transactions unless they are approved or ratified by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. If a transaction or relationship constitutes a Related-Party Transaction, the Committee will then review the transaction or relationship to determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction. In making its determination, the Committee considers several factors including, but not limited to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· whether the terms of the Related-Party Transaction are fair to j2 Global and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party;  
· whether j2 Global has business reasons to enter into the transaction or relationship;  
· whether the transaction or relationship will impair the independence of an outside director;  
· the materiality of the transaction or relationship, taking into account the importance of the interest to the related party, the dollar amount involved and the significance of the transaction to j2 Global and its investors in light of all the circumstances;  
· whether the transaction or relationship raises any disclosure or reputational issues; and  
· whether the transaction or relationship presents an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer of j2 Global.

 On September 25, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to enter into a commitment to invest $200 million in an investment fund (the "Fund"). The manager, OCV Management, LLC ("OCV"), and general partner of the Fund are entities with respect to which Mr. Ressler, Chairman of the Board of Directors, is indirectly the majority equity holder. In addition, Mr. Zucker, who resigned from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective December 31, 2017 and who serves as an advisor to the Company through December 31, 2018 pursuant to the Letter Agreement described above, has become a co-managing principal of OCV and a significant equity holder. As a limited partner in the Fund, the Company will pay an annual management fee to the manager equal to 2.0% (reduced by 10% each year beginning with the sixth year) of capital commitments. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Fund's limited partnership agreement, once the Company has received distributions equal to its invested capital, the Fund's general partner would be entitled to a carried interest equal to 20%. The Fund has a six year investment period, subject to certain exceptions. The commitment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board in accordance with the RPT Policy.  In 2018, the Company received six capital call notices from the management of OCV for approximately $36.8 million, inclusive of certain management fees.
