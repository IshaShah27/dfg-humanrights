PROXY STATEMENT 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATING TO PROXY MATERIALS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Why am I receiving these proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of Cadence Design Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on May 2, 2019, at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. The purpose of the Annual Meeting is set forth in this proxy statement and in the accompanying notice of annual meeting. 
The Annual Meeting will be held in Building 10 of Cadence's offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, San Jose, California 95134. 
This proxy statement contains important information to consider when deciding how to vote on the matters brought before the Annual Meeting. Stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are encouraged to read it carefully. 
Cadence intends to publish this proxy statement on the investor relations page of its website at www.cadence.com/cadence/investor_relations on or about March 22, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  How may I obtain Cadence's annual report on Form 10-K?  
[END TABLE]
A copy of Cadence's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 is available free of charge on the internet from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") at www.sec.gov and on the investor relations page of Cadence's website at www.cadence.com/cadence/investor_relations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials?  How may I obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC, Cadence is furnishing proxy materials to its stockholders primarily via the internet, rather than mailing paper copies of these materials to each stockholder. This process expedites stockholders' receipt of the proxy materials, lowers the costs of the Annual Meeting and helps conserve natural resources. 
On or about March 22, 2019, Cadence will mail to each stockholder (other than those stockholders who previously had requested electronic or paper delivery of the proxy materials) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that contains instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials (including Cadence's proxy statement and annual report) on the internet and how to access a proxy card to vote on the internet or by telephone. 
If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a paper copy of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  How can I access the proxy materials over the internet?  
[END TABLE]
Your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will contain instructions on how to access and view the proxy materials on the internet and how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials. 
The proxy materials are also available on Cadence's website at the following address: www.cadence.com/cadence/investor_relations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               1 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  I received one copy of the proxy materials. May I get additional copies?  
[END TABLE]
You may request additional copies of Cadence's Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy materials by writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134, by calling Cadence's Investor Relations Group at (408) 944-7100 or by emailing the Investor Relations Group at investor_relations@cadence.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.  What if I received a notice from my broker stating that it will be "householding" deliveries to my address?  What if I received more than one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to deliver a single copy of certain proxy materials to certain stockholders who share the same address, a practice referred to as "householding." Some banks, brokers and other nominees will be householding Cadence's Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy materials for stockholders who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, unless contrary instructions are received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or other nominee holder of your Cadence common stock that the broker or other nominee will be householding the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. 
If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy materials and wish to receive only one copy, please notify your broker or other nominee holder of your Cadence common stock. If you received a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding by your broker and you would like to receive separate copies of such materials, you may also submit a request to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134, by calling Cadence's Investor Relations Group at (408) 944-7100 or by emailing the Investor Relations Group at investor_relations@cadence.com. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATING TO VOTING 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  7.  Who may vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
You may vote if you owned shares of Cadence common stock, $0.01 par value per share, as of the close of business on March 4, 2019, which is the Record Date for the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on the Record Date, Cadence had 281,186,212 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
Each share outstanding on the Record Date is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting. You are entitled to vote shares that are (i) held directly in your name or (ii) held for you as the beneficial owner in a brokerage account or through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in your name. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  8.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?   
[END TABLE]
If you own shares of Cadence common stock that are registered directly in your name with Cadence's transfer agent, Computershare Limited, you are considered the "stockholder of record" of those shares of Cadence common stock. 
If you own shares of Cadence common stock that are held through a broker, bank or other nominee (that is, "in street name"), you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares of Cadence common stock. In that case, your broker, bank or other nominee is considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares of Cadence common stock and should be forwarding the proxy materials to you. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote those shares of Cadence common stock. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 2               
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  9.  How do I vote my shares if I am a stockholder of record?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date, you have three options for submitting your vote prior to the Annual Meeting: (i) via the internet, (ii) by telephone or (iii) by mail (by completing, signing, dating and mailing a paper proxy card, which a stockholder can request as outlined in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials). 
If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may also submit your vote in person, in which case any votes that were previously submitted – whether via the internet, telephone or mail – will be superseded by the vote that is cast at the Annual Meeting. 
Whether your proxy is submitted via the internet, telephone or mail, if it is properly completed and submitted and if it is not revoked prior to the Annual Meeting, the shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner set forth in this proxy statement or as otherwise specified by you. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  10.  How do I vote my shares if I am a beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee?  
[END TABLE]
As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote, and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If a broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares, you will receive instructions from them that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. 
Shares of Cadence common stock held through a broker, bank or other nominee may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting by you only if you obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  11.  What is the vote required to pass each of the proposals?  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1 – regarding the election of directors, each director must receive a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director), provided that in a contested election, each director must be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposals 2, 4 and 5 – the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting, either in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, is required. 
Proposal 3 – regarding the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding voting stock of Cadence is required. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  12.  Who will bear the cost of this proxy solicitation?  
[END TABLE]
Cadence will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies, including the preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this proxy statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to stockholders by Cadence in connection with the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding shares of Cadence common stock beneficially owned by others for forwarding to the beneficial owners. Cadence will reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of Cadence common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners. 
The solicitation of proxies through this proxy statement may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile and use of the internet or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other employees of Cadence and by Georgeson LLC. Cadence has retained Georgeson LLC to solicit proxies for an aggregate fee of approximately $10,500, plus reasonable expenses. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other employees of Cadence or any of its subsidiaries for their services in soliciting proxies. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  13.  What are broker non-votes and how are the broker  non-votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
Broker non-votes include shares for which a bank, broker or other nominee (i.e., record holder) has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and for which the record holder does not have discretionary power to vote on a particular matter. Broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes 
[BEGIN TABLE]               3 
[END TABLE]
 of determining the presence of a quorum, but how broker non-votes affect the outcome of a vote differs based on the proposal. 
Proposals 1, 2, 4 and 5 – broker non-votes will have no effect on voting on such proposals. 
Proposal 3 – regarding the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  14.  When does a broker have discretion to vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
Under the rules that govern brokers who are record holders of shares that are held in brokerage accounts for the beneficial owners of the shares, brokers who do not receive voting instructions from their clients have the discretion to vote uninstructed shares on routine matters but have no discretion to vote such uninstructed shares on non-routine matters. 
Proposal 1 – regarding the election of directors, Proposal 2 – regarding the approval of the amendment of the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan, Proposal 3 – regarding the approval of the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Proposal 4 – regarding an advisory resolution to approve named executive officer compensation are all considered non-routine matters. Therefore, unless you provide voting instructions to any broker holding shares on your behalf, your broker may not use discretionary authority to vote your shares on Proposals 1, 2, 3 or 4. 
Proposal 5 – regarding the ratification of the selection of Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter and brokers are therefore permitted to vote shares held by them without instruction from beneficial owners. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  15.  How are abstentions counted?  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but how abstentions affect the outcome of a vote differs based on the proposal. 
Proposal 1 – regarding the election of directors, abstentions count neither as a vote "for" nor a vote "against" a director. 
Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5 – abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  16.  Can I change a vote I have previously cast?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change or withdraw your proxy at any time before it is actually voted, irrespective of whether your proxy was submitted via the internet, telephone or mail. Your proxy may be revoked by providing a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134, or it may be revoked by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, be sufficient to revoke a proxy. 
If you are a beneficial owner who holds your stock through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must contact the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares for specific instructions on how to change or revoke your vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  17.  How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors of Cadence (the "Board") recommends that you vote: 
Proposal 1:   FOR the election of each of the nine director nominees named in this proxy statement; 
Proposal 2:   FOR the approval of the amendment of the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan; 
Proposal 3:   FOR the approval of the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation; 
Proposal 4:   FOR the advisory resolution to approve named executive officer compensation; and 
Proposal 5:   FOR the ratification of the selection of Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 4               
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
  18.  What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of Cadence common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date is required for a quorum at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  19.  Who may attend the Annual Meeting in person?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders at the close of business on the Record Date as described above, as well as holders of a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to attend the Annual Meeting. Such individuals should be prepared to present government-issued photo identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, and proof of Cadence stock ownership at the close of business on the Record Date. Stockholders who were not stockholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date but hold shares through a bank, broker or other nominee on the Record Date should be prepared to present proof of beneficial ownership at the close of business on the Record Date, such as an account statement or similar evidence of ownership. Stockholders will be admitted to the Annual Meeting if they comply with these procedures. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  20.  Who is the inspector of elections for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATING TO STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  21.  Can stockholders submit proposals for inclusion in Cadence's proxy materials for the next annual meeting?   
[END TABLE]
Stockholder proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and must be submitted in writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134 and received no later than November 23, 2019 to be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Cadence stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  22.  Can stockholders nominate directors for inclusion in Cadence's proxy materials for the next annual meeting?   
[END TABLE]
Cadence's Bylaws provide that, under certain circumstances, director candidates nominated by a stockholder or group of stockholders may be included in Cadence's annual meeting proxy materials. These proxy access provisions of Cadence's Bylaws provide, among other things, that a stockholder or group of no more than 20 stockholders seeking to include director candidates in Cadence's proxy materials must own at least 3% of Cadence's outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least the previous three years. The number of stockholder-nominated candidates to be included in any set of proxy materials cannot exceed the greater of two individuals or 20% of the number of directors (rounded down to the nearest whole number), which number may be reduced under certain circumstances, as described in Cadence's Bylaws. The nominating stockholder or group of stockholders must also deliver the information required by Cadence's Bylaws and satisfy the other applicable requirements of Cadence's Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications set forth in Cadence's Bylaws. 
Notices to include stockholder-nominated candidates in Cadence's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of stockholders must be submitted in writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134 no later than the close of business on January 3, 2020 and no earlier than the close of business on December 4, 2019, and must otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in Cadence's Bylaws. However, if the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Cadence stockholders changes by more than 30 days from the first anniversary 
[BEGIN TABLE]               5 
[END TABLE]
 of the 2019 Annual Meeting, nomination notices must be submitted in writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first public announcement of the date of the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  23.  What is the deadline for stockholders to submit director nominations or other proposals for consideration at the next  annual meeting that stockholders do not seek to include in Cadence's proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
For director nominations or other business proposals that the stockholder does not seek to include in Cadence's 2020 proxy materials pursuant to the proxy access provisions set forth in Cadence's Bylaws or Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, the nominations or proposals must be submitted in writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134 no later than the close of business on February 2, 2020 and no earlier than the close of business on January 3, 2020, and must otherwise satisfy the requirements set forth in Cadence's Bylaws. However, if the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Cadence stockholders changes by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting, any such stockholder proposals or nominations must be submitted in writing to Cadence's Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first public announcement of the date of the meeting. 
If the stockholder does not also comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act, Cadence may exercise discretionary voting authority under proxies it solicits to vote in accordance with its best judgment on any such stockholder proposal or nomination submitted by a stockholder.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD 
Dear Cadence stockholders: 
My fellow members of the board of directors join me in thanking you for your investment in Cadence. I welcome this opportunity to communicate with you about several of the board's priorities during the year. We see our role as representing your interests. In that regard, we provide oversight of Cadence in a manner that helps the company execute its business strategy and engage in prudent risk management in the dynamic, fast-moving environment in which it operates. 
Business Strategy and Risk Management 
The board discusses Cadence's business strategy and risk throughout the year. In 2018, Cadence focused on innovating and launching new products, including the industry's first silicon-proven, long-reach 112G SerDes IP in 7 nanometers. The company constantly reviews its strategy in light of technology trends such as artificial intelligence, cloud/data centers and 5G. Cadence continued to return significant value to stockholders as its System Design Enablement strategy provided a roadmap to deliver excellent operating results. 
Ongoing Board and Management Succession Planning 
Succession planning at the board and senior management levels are key priorities. 
We discussed board refreshment at several meetings this past year. We are focused on ensuring that the board continues to be comprised of individuals with relevant expertise, integrity, experience, skills, judgment and diversity of background, and has the benefit of fresh perspectives that newer directors can bring. 
We devote significant attention to management succession planning and talent development. We invite senior managers into the boardroom to help us understand their strengths and facilitate our plans for succession. 
Focus on Corporate Governance Structures and Practices 
Since Cadence joined the S&P 500 in late 2017, we have reviewed the company's corporate governance in light of common practices at S&P 500 companies and alignment with Cadence's needs. We have made appropriate adjustments and we are pleased that the company's structures and practices are generally aligned with the best practices at S&P 500 companies and its peers. 
As you will note, at this year's annual meeting we are asking you to approve amendments to Cadence's Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate supermajority voting requirements and replace them with a majority of outstanding stock voting standard. This elimination of supermajority voting requirements will bring Cadence's practices more in line with common practice at S&P 500 companies and its peers. 
Stockholder Engagement and Outreach 
We have a robust stockholder outreach and engagement program whereby we communicate with key stockholders to better understand their viewpoints about Cadence's strategy and governance practices and policies. Topics we have discussed with stockholders since the 2018 annual meeting include Cadence's board composition and refreshment, culture and diversity of background, and executive compensation. Stockholders also have the opportunity to communicate their views at Cadence's annual meeting or by writing to us at the address provided in the section of this proxy statement entitled "Communication with Directors." 
[BEGIN TABLE]               7 
[END TABLE]
We encourage you to read this proxy statement (including the board's recommendations) and vote your shares, irrespective of whether you plan to attend the annual meeting in person. Your vote is important to us. 
Thank you for your continued support of Cadence. 
Sincerely, 
John B. Shoven, Ph.D. 
Chairman of the Board

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
Cadence is governed by the Board and the committees of the Board, which meet throughout the year. Cadence and its Board are committed to sound corporate governance, which helps Cadence compete more effectively, sustain its success and build long-term stockholder value. The Board and management regularly review and evaluate Cadence's corporate governance practices. Cadence's corporate governance documents, including the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Finance Committee and the Strategy Committee, the Code of Business Conduct, the Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures and the Board's Corporate Governance Guidelines, are available on the corporate governance page of Cadence's website at www.cadence.com. Paper copies of these documents are also available to stockholders upon written request directed to Cadence's Corporate Secretary at Cadence's corporate offices located at 2655 Seely Avenue, Building 5, San Jose, California 95134. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               9 
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which cover various topics relating to the Board and its activities, including the selection and composition of the Board, Board leadership, compensation of directors, responsibilities of directors, Board access to senior management and outside advisors, meeting procedures, Board and committee responsibilities and other matters. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be amended by the Board at any time, and were most recently amended in February 2019. 
Code of Business Conduct 
Cadence has adopted a Code of Business Conduct to provide standards for ethical conduct in dealing with customers, suppliers, agents, government officials and others. The Code of Business Conduct applies to Cadence's directors, officers and employees (and those of its subsidiaries), including Cadence's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Code of Business Conduct also applies to certain independent contractors and consultants who work at Cadence's facilities or at Cadence's direction. Compliance with the Code of Business Conduct is a condition to continued service or employment with Cadence. The Code of Business Conduct covers topics including integrity, confidentiality of assets and information, conflicts of interest, compliance with federal and state securities laws, employment practices, payment practices and compliance with competition, anti-corruption and other laws and regulations. 
Any waiver of a provision of the Code of Business Conduct with respect to a director or an executive officer may only be made by the Board. Any waivers for other employees may be granted only by the CEO or the General Counsel or their respective designees. To the extent required under applicable SEC rules, Cadence will disclose material amendments to the Code of Business Conduct and any waiver of its provisions with respect to any director or executive officer by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC or posting such information on its website at www.cadence.com. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Stock Ownership Guidelines for Cadence's directors and executive officers to further align the interests of the directors and executive officers with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce Cadence's commitment to sound corporate governance. Each non-employee member of the Board is required to hold shares of Cadence common stock with a value equal to at least $320,000 within five years of the date of his or her initial appointment or election to the Board. Cadence's CEO is required to hold shares of Cadence common stock with a value equal to three times his or her annual base salary within five years of the date of his or her appointment, and Cadence's other executive officers are required to hold shares of Cadence common stock with a value equal to his or her annual base salary within five years of the date of his or her appointment. 
As of the Record Date, all directors and executive officers met the stock ownership guidelines applicable to them. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
Cadence's Securities Trading Policy restricts certain transactions in Cadence securities and prohibits Cadence's directors, executive officers and all other Cadence employees (and their respective family and household members) from hedging their ownership of Cadence securities (regardless of whether such securities were granted as compensation or are otherwise held, directly or indirectly, by such employee or director), including by purchasing financial instruments such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, or trading in publicly traded options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Cadence securities.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
BOARD MEMBERSHIP 
The Board currently consists of nine members: Mark W. Adams, Susan L. Bostrom, James D. Plummer, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, John B. Shoven, Roger S. Siboni, Young K. Sohn, Lip-Bu Tan and Mary Agnes Wilderotter. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
The Board determines director independence in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which require that at least a majority of the Board be "independent directors" within the meaning of the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. To be "independent" under the Nasdaq listing standards, a director must not have a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Cadence director. In determining each director's independence, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in conjunction with the guidelines provided by the Nasdaq listing standards. 
CURRENT INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 
Among the current members of the Board, the Board has determined that Mses. Bostrom and Wilderotter, Drs. Plummer, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli and Shoven, and Messrs. Adams and Siboni are independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing standards. Mr. Tan, the CEO of Cadence, and Mr. Sohn, the Corporate President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics, a customer of Cadence, are not deemed independent. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP 
Mr. Tan serves as CEO, and Dr. Shoven, an independent director, serves as Chair of the Board. The Board believes that at this time, Cadence and its stockholders are best served by this leadership structure because it is valuable to have a strong independent leader, separate from the CEO, assisting the Board in fulfilling its role of overseeing management and Cadence's risk management practices. While the Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the roles of the Chair and the CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals, a lead independent director would be required if the roles were to be combined. This provides the Board with flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined in the future based on the Board's assessment of Cadence's needs and leadership from time to time. 
PROCESS FOR SELECTING DIRECTOR NOMINEES AND CANDIDATES 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates and recommends director candidates for nomination by the full Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly discusses and annually reviews as a committee and with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors (such as integrity, experience, judgment, diversity of background, independence, ability to commit sufficient time and attention to Board activities, understanding of Cadence's products, technologies and strategy, and the specific skills set forth under "Director Qualifications, Skills and Experience" below in Proposal 1) in the context of the current composition of the Board and its committees. 
STOCKHOLDER RECOMMENDATIONS OF DIRECTOR CANDIDATES 
Stockholders who wish to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify Cadence's Corporate Secretary or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in writing with the supporting materials 
[BEGIN TABLE]               11 
[END TABLE]
 required by Cadence's Bylaws as described under "Information About the Annual Meeting" above and any other material the stockholder considers necessary or appropriate. Only candidates recommended in accordance with these procedures are eligible to serve as directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate any such candidates in the same manner as it evaluates candidates recommended from other sources. 
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE 
During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Board held seven meetings, in addition to taking actions by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting. Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served that were held during the period for which he or she was a director or committee member during fiscal 2018. The Corporate Governance Guidelines encourage directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, and all of Cadence's then-serving directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of Cadence stockholders. 
INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR MEETINGS 
Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, Cadence's independent directors meet separately at least twice each year and Dr. Shoven, as the Chair of the Board and an independent director, presides over meetings of the independent directors. 
BOARD EVALUATIONS 
The Board is committed to reviewing its performance through an annual evaluation process. Through the evaluations, the Board assesses its processes, meetings, planning and overall effectiveness. The directors provide feedback on the Board and its committees through questionnaires and interviews with an independent third party. The independent third party reviews the results and feedback provided by the directors and follows up with the directors regarding their evaluations. At a Board meeting each year, the independent third party, with the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, presents the findings to the Board. Any findings that require additional consideration are addressed at subsequent Board and committee meetings. 
BOARD SUCCESSION PLANNING 
Board succession planning is a regular topic for discussion at Board meetings. In October 2018, the Board formed a subcommittee of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to assist the Board to further develop its approach to Board succession planning, with a focus on ensuring that the Board has the expertise, integrity, experience, skills, judgment and diversity of background needed to govern Cadence now and in the future. 
CEO AND MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING 
The Board is actively engaged and involved in the succession planning of Cadence's management. The Compensation Committee regularly discusses and annually reports to the Board with respect to CEO succession planning, including policies for CEO selection and succession in the event of incapacitation, emergency situations, operational needs, retirement or removal of the CEO and evaluations of and development plans for any potential successors to the CEO. In addition, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the CEO, regularly discusses and annually reviews senior leadership succession planning and reports to the Board with respect to Cadence's management development program and succession planning. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 12               
[END TABLE]
BOARD RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board exercises its risk oversight function through the Board as a whole and through certain of its committees. The Board and the relevant committees seek to understand and oversee the most critical risks facing Cadence. The Board does not view risk in isolation, but considers risk as part of its regular consideration of business decisions and business strategy. The Board as a whole has the ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management but has delegated the oversight of certain risks to the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee as set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Committee      Primary Areas of Risk Oversight   
   Committee      Primary Areas of Risk Oversight

   Corporate Governance and   Nominating Committee      Cadence's corporate governance, the composition, structure and evaluation of, and succession planning for, the Board and its committees, and  review and approval of related party policy and transactions   
[END TABLE]
The Board and the relevant committees review with Cadence's management the risk management practices for which they have oversight responsibility. Since overseeing risk is an ongoing process and inherent in Cadence's strategic decisions, the Board and the relevant committees also discuss risk throughout the year in relation to specific proposed actions. 
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
The Board is committed to active engagement with Cadence stockholders. In addition to Cadence management's regular engagement with Cadence stockholders throughout 2018, the Chair of the Board, the General Counsel and the Treasurer, on behalf of the Board, met with a number of Cadence stockholders to obtain feedback on key topics, including corporate governance and executive compensation. The Board and Cadence management intend to continue to engage with Cadence stockholders in 2019.

Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is currently comprised of four non-employee, independent directors of Cadence, each of whom the Board has determined to be "independent" as defined by the Nasdaq listing standards applicable to compensation committee members and satisfies the applicable independence standards under the Exchange Act for compensation committee service. All Compensation Committee members are also "outside directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 
Although the Compensation Committee may delegate its authority over certain matters to management when it deems it to be appropriate and in the best interests of Cadence, the Compensation Committee did not delegate any authority with respect to the consideration and determination of executive officer compensation in fiscal 2018 and does not currently expect to delegate any such authority in the future. At or near the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee typically establishes base salary levels and target bonuses for the CEO and other executive officers of Cadence. In addition, the Compensation Committee administers and, if deemed necessary, may amend Cadence's Senior Executive Bonus Plan, Cadence's equity-based compensation plans and stock purchase plans, and Cadence's deferred compensation plans. The Compensation Committee also reviews and recommends to the Board the compensation of Cadence's directors, and the Compensation Committee did not delegate any authority with respect to the consideration and determination of director compensation in fiscal 2018. 
The Compensation Committee charter was last amended in February 2019. The duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Identifying, reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the CEO and any director  who is also a Cadence employee, and evaluating the performance of the CEO and any employee director in light of those goals and objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing the evaluation of Cadence's management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing at least annually Cadence's senior leadership succession planning in consultation with the CEO;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing compensation programs and determining the compensation of Cadence's executive officers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing Cadence's overall compensation practices, policies and programs, assessing whether Cadence's  compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives for management and employees, assessing the risks associated with such practices, policies and programs, and assessing the results of Cadence's most recent advisory vote on executive  compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing annually an assessment of any potential conflicts of interest raised by the work of compensation consultants,  whether retained by the Compensation Committee or management, who are involved in determining or recommending executive or Board compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assessing the independence of any consultants or other outside advisors that the Compensation Committee selects or receives  advice from, and being directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any consultants and advisors retained by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]               15 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that having an outside evaluation of executive officer salary, bonus and equity compensation is a valuable tool for the Compensation Committee and Cadence stockholders. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained the services of a compensation consultant, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC, for advice regarding the compensation of Cadence's executive officers. The Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy for a number of purposes, including constructing and reviewing peer groups for compensation comparison purposes, performing a competitive assessment of Cadence's compensation programs, practices and levels for its executive officers and certain other employees and providing information on typical industry practices concerning employment, equity practices, severance and change in control agreements. Semler Brossy has not been engaged to perform any other work for Cadence. Pursuant to the factors set forth in Item 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC and the Nasdaq listing standards, the Compensation Committee has reviewed the independence of Semler Brossy and conducted a conflicts of interest assessment, and has concluded that Semler Brossy is independent and Semler Brossy's work for the Compensation Committee has not raised any conflicts of interest. 
In determining the compensation of Cadence's executive officers, including Cadence's named executive officers (as defined below in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"), the Compensation Committee considers the competitive assessments provided by and through consultation with Semler Brossy. In addition, Cadence's CEO typically makes assessments and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on whether there should be adjustments to the annual base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and equity incentive compensation of executive officers other than himself based upon an assessment of certain factors described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below. The Compensation Committee reviews such assessments and recommendations and determines whether or not to approve or modify the CEO's recommendations. The Compensation Committee's decisions are made, however, by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below for more information. 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Semler Brossy, reviews Cadence's compensation practices, policies and programs for all employees, including the named executive officers, to assess the risks associated with such practices, policies and programs. The risk-mitigating factors considered by the Compensation Committee include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The use of different types of compensation that provide a balance of short-term and long-term incentives with fixed and  variable components;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cadence's Securities Trading Policy, which restricts certain transactions in Cadence's securities, prohibits  hedging by members of the Board and all employees and requires executive officers and members of the Board to obtain permission from the General Counsel before trading any shares of Cadence common stock during periods when the trading window is  open, except those transactions expressly permitted in such policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cadence's Clawback Policy, which, in the event of a restatement of Cadence's reported financial results, allows  Cadence to seek to recover or cancel performance-based bonuses and equity awards made to executive officers to the extent that performance goals would not have been met under such restated financial results;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Caps on bonus awards to limit windfalls; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consideration of ethical behavior, which is integral in assessing the performance of all executive officers, including  the named executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Board has determined that all seven Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee members are "independent" as defined by the Nasdaq listing standards. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 16               
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee charter was last amended in February 2019. The duties and responsibilities of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee include:

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Considering potential director candidates recommended by Cadence's management and stockholders in the same manner as  nominees identified by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; provided that, with respect to those candidates recommended by stockholders, such stockholders have provided Cadence with a notice that sets forth information as to such  stockholders and director candidates in accordance with Cadence's Bylaws;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determining whether to approve any director (a) accepting employment, directorship, consulting engagement, advisory  board position or any other affiliation with another company or (b) starting a new business which may be, or give the appearance of, a conflict of interest; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing the orientation program that Cadence provides to new directors and making recommendations regarding director  continuing education programs.  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly discusses and annually reviews the appropriate size of the Board, whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise, and the need for particular expertise on the Board. If vacancies on the Board are anticipated or otherwise arise, the committee considers potential director candidates, which may come to the committee's attention through a variety of channels, including current directors, officers, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board as to the persons who should be nominated or elected by the Board, and the Board determines whether to reject, elect or nominate the candidate, as the case may be, after considering the recommendation of the committee. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Finance Committee 
The Finance Committee, on behalf of the Board, evaluates and approves financings, mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other financial commitments of Cadence to third parties and has the authority to approve those that involve amounts up to $60 million. The Finance Committee charter was last amended in February 2019. 
The Finance Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               17 
[END TABLE]

The Strategy Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2018. 
COMPONENTS OF DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, annually reviews and recommends to the Board the compensation program for directors who are not employees of Cadence. Directors who are Cadence employees, such as Mr. Tan, do not receive additional compensation for their service on the Board. In setting non-employee director compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the competitiveness of Cadence's director compensation from a number of different perspectives, including average total compensation, aggregate compensation for the full Board and individual director compensation as differentiated by committee membership and leadership roles. The Compensation Committee also reviews Cadence's director compensation relative to Cadence's Peer Group, which is also used to determine market levels for executive compensation (see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below for more information). 
The following table sets forth the components of the non-employee directors' compensation for fiscal 2018:

(1)   Directors may elect to defer cash compensation payable to them under Cadence's deferred compensation plan. These  deferred compensation amounts are credited to participant accounts, with values indexed to the performance of mutual funds or money market accounts selected by the participant. Cadence does not match contributions made under Cadence's deferred  compensation plan.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)   On February 7, 2018, each then-serving non-employee director (other than the  Chair of the Board) was granted an incentive stock award of 4,926 shares of Cadence common stock under Cadence's 1995 Directors Stock Incentive Plan (the "Directors Plan") (which award had a grant date fair value of approximately  $190,000) and Dr. Shoven, the non-employee director serving as Chair of the Board, was granted an incentive stock award of 5,703 shares of Cadence common stock under the Directors Plan (which award had a  grant date fair value of approximately $220,000).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)   As of the Record Date, all directors met the stock ownership guidelines applicable to them. Separately, Cadence's  Securities Trading Policy restricts certain transactions in Cadence securities and prohibits directors from hedging their ownership of Cadence securities, including by purchasing financial instruments such as prepaid variable forward contracts,  equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, or trading in publicly traded options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Cadence securities.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, a medical and prescription benefits coverage reimbursement plan is available to active non-employee directors who were directors on December 31, 2014 (the "Eligible Directors"), eligible retired directors who retired from the Board on or prior to December 31, 2014 (the "Eligible Retired Directors") and their respective dependents (the "Medical Reimbursement Plan"). Directors first elected or appointed to the Board after December 31, 2014 are not eligible to participate in the Medical Reimbursement Plan. Eligible Directors and their dependents may obtain coverage under the Medical Reimbursement Plan during their term of service on the Board. Eligible Retired Directors, Eligible Directors and their dependents may continue coverage under the Medical Reimbursement Plan starting immediately after the director's termination of service for a continuous term not to exceed such director's term of service on the Board. 
A director's eligibility for participation in the Medical Reimbursement Plan immediately ceases if the plan administrator determines that he or she has violated the Code of Business Conduct or is engaged as an employee, consultant, director or advisor of, or significant investor in, a competitor of Cadence. Under the Medical Reimbursement Plan, Cadence reimburses 100% of the premiums for participants and their dependents up to a maximum of $20,000 for expenses incurred per calendar year, which maximum amount may be adjusted for future changes in medical costs. Benefits under the Medical Reimbursement Plan are fully taxable to the participants and Cadence does not gross up reimbursement payments to cover any such taxes.

MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has recommended, and the Board has nominated, the nine nominees named below for election to the Board. Each director elected at the Annual Meeting will hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Cadence stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until the director's earlier resignation, removal or death. 
Each nominee listed below is currently a Cadence director, and all of the nominees have previously been elected by Cadence stockholders. 
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND DIVERSITY OF BACKGROUND 
The Board believes that the Board, as a whole, should possess a combination of skills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee Cadence's business. In addition, the Board believes that there are certain attributes that every director should possess, as reflected in the Board's membership criteria. Accordingly, the Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and Cadence's current and future needs. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for developing the Board membership criteria and recommending them to the Board for approval. The criteria, which are set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, include a prospective nominee's integrity, experience, judgment, diversity of background, independence, financial literacy, ability to commit sufficient time and attention to Board activities, skills such as an understanding of electronic design, semiconductor and electronics systems technologies, international background and other relevant characteristics. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers all of these criteria in the context of the needs of the Board from time to time. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly discusses and annually reviews as a committee and with the Board the appropriate experience, skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current composition of the Board and its committees. In seeking diversity of background, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee seeks a variety of occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board in order to obtain a range of viewpoints and perspectives. This annual assessment enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board as a whole, and in individual directors, as Cadence's needs evolve and change over time, and also enables the Board to assess the effectiveness of its policy to seek a diversity of background on the Board. In identifying director candidates from time to time, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board may establish specific skills and experience that it believes Cadence should seek in order to have an effective board of directors.

DIRECTOR TENURE 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews the tenure of Cadence's directors and practices a long-term approach to board refreshment. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that in addition to having directors who can provide new perspectives, it is important to have directors who understand Cadence's industry, business, technology and strategy, the combination of which is essential to long-term value creation for Cadence stockholders. 
The following table sets forth the summary of the tenure of the director nominees:

VOTING INFORMATION AND BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of each director nominee. 
The election of directors at the Annual Meeting requires that each director receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director, which means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director. If, however, the election of directors is contested, the directors will be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. The election this year is not contested and the majority voting standard outlined above applies. 
Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, in order for an incumbent Cadence director to become a nominee at the Annual Meeting, such director must submit an irrevocable resignation that becomes immediately effective if the votes cast "for" such director do not exceed the votes cast "against" such director in an election that is not a contested election, and if the Board accepts the resignation in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board for such purpose. If a nominee who is currently serving as a Cadence director is not elected at the Annual Meeting, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject such director's resignation, or whether to take other action. The Board will act on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose (as required by applicable law) its decision and the reasons behind it within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. 
If any nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of unexpected circumstances, the Board may designate a substitute nominee or reduce the size of the Board. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, proxies will be voted for such substitute nominee. Each person nominated for election has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected, and Cadence has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve. 
Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the election; however, abstentions will not be counted as votes "for" or "against" directors and will not have an effect on the election of directors. Broker non-votes will be treated as not being entitled to vote on the election of directors, and, therefore, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether the directors have been elected. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted FOR the election of each of the nine director nominees.

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE OMNIBUS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
OVERVIEW 
Cadence is requesting that Cadence stockholders approve the amendment of the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (as it may be amended and restated, the "Omnibus Plan"). On February 6, 2019, subject to stockholder approval, the Board approved the amendment of the Omnibus Plan, which would increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 4,000,000 shares, extend the expiration date of the Omnibus Plan to May 2, 2029 and remove certain provisions previously intended to qualify certain awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), as in effect prior to the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). While the annual per person grant limit included in the Omnibus Plan was originally included to qualify certain awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Board elected to retain such per person limit despite the removal of certain other provisions related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
As of February 25, 2019, 8,532,454 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The proposed increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Omnibus Plan represents approximately 1.42% of Cadence's outstanding common stock as of the Record Date. 
The Omnibus Plan was initially approved by the stockholders on May 6, 2014, with 14,866,116 authorized shares of common stock reserved for issuance. The Board on February 10, 2015 and the stockholders on May 14, 2015 approved an amendment to the Omnibus Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 7,500,000 shares, the Board on February 9, 2016 and the stockholders on May 5, 2016 approved another amendment and restatement to the Omnibus Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 6,000,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Omnibus Plan to May 5, 2026, the Board on February 22, 2017 and the stockholders on May 4, 2017 approved another amendment and restatement to the Omnibus Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 6,500,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Omnibus Plan to May 4, 2027, and the Board on February 7, 2018 and the stockholders on May 3, 2018 approved another amendment to the Omnibus Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 2,000,000 shares and to extend the expiration date of the Omnibus Plan to May 3, 2028. 
REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE AND EXTENSION OF THE EXPIRATION DATE 
The primary purpose of the amendment of the Omnibus Plan is to ensure that Cadence can continue to grant awards to eligible participants. The Omnibus Plan provides broad-based equity compensation that is viewed as an essential and long-standing element of Cadence's culture and success and is deemed critical in building stockholder value by attracting and retaining the most talented employees and consultants. Giving eligible employees and consultants the opportunity to become Cadence stockholders and participate in Cadence's success aligns the interests of participating individuals with those of stockholders. The Omnibus Plan also helps to attract and retain employees and consultants because equity incentive plans are a common benefit offered by Cadence's competitors and other industry leaders. Cadence believes that the Omnibus Plan is a highly valued benefit that is necessary in order for Cadence to compete with other companies in attracting and retaining employees and consultants.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three-Year Net Burn Rate  
[END TABLE]
Cadence measures net burn rate as the number of shares underlying awards granted by Cadence in the applicable fiscal year (including the effect of cancellations and forfeitures), divided by the basic weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at fiscal year end. Based on this approach, Cadence's three-year average annual net burn rate is 1.93%, as set forth below.

Overhang 
Cadence calculates overhang as (i) the number of shares underlying all outstanding awards under all equity plans (which, as of February 25, 2019, consisted of 5,708,695 shares underlying vested and unvested stock options, 6,663,408 shares underlying unvested incentive stock awards and 1,917,473 shares underlying unvested RSUs), divided by (ii) the number of shares of Cadence common stock outstanding excluding unvested incentive stock awards (which, as of February 25, 2019, was 274,505,310 shares). Based on this approach, as of February 25, 2019, equity compensation overhang was approximately 5.21%. 
SUMMARY OF THE OMNIBUS PLAN 
The following summary of the material provisions of the Omnibus Plan is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Omnibus Plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement. 
General 
The Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, incentive stock awards and RSUs. Incentive stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan are intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Nonstatutory stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan are not intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" under the Internal Revenue Code. See "Federal Income Tax Information" below for a discussion of the tax treatment of awards that may be granted under the Omnibus Plan. 
Purpose 
The purposes of the Omnibus Plan are to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees and consultants of Cadence and its affiliates, and to promote the success of Cadence's business. 
Administration 
The Board administers the Omnibus Plan and has the final power to interpret the Omnibus Plan, including the power to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Omnibus Plan and to delegate administration of the Omnibus Plan to a committee, such as the Compensation Committee, consisting of one or more members of the Board. The Board has the power to determine which of the persons eligible under the Omnibus Plan will be granted awards, the types of awards that will be granted, when and how each award will be granted, and the terms and provisions of each award to be granted in accordance with the provisions of the Omnibus Plan. 
The Board may, by resolution, authorize one or more officers of Cadence to approve grants up to limits and subject to terms specified by the Board. However, in no event will any officer be delegated authority with respect to grants to be made to executive officers of Cadence. 
The Board has delegated administration of the Omnibus Plan to the Compensation Committee. As used in this proxy statement solely with respect to describing the terms of the Omnibus Plan, the "Board" refers to any committee the Board appoints to administer the Omnibus Plan as well as to the Board itself. 
Eligibility 
Only employees of Cadence and its affiliates are eligible for incentive stock options under the Omnibus Plan. Employees and consultants of Cadence and its affiliates are eligible to receive nonstatutory stock options, incentive stock awards and RSUs under the Omnibus Plan. Non-employee directors are not eligible to receive awards under the Omnibus Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               33 
[END TABLE]
The Board elected to retain a per person limit despite the removal of certain other provisions related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code in the Omnibus Plan such that no person may be granted awards under the Omnibus Plan covering more than an aggregate of 2,216,702 shares of common stock in any calendar year. 
Employees and consultants of Cadence and its subsidiaries, including Cadence's executive officers, are eligible to receive awards under the Omnibus Plan if selected by the Board. As of the Record Date, Cadence had approximately 7,800 employees. 
Shares Subject to the Omnibus Plan 
Upon stockholder approval of this proposal, an additional 4,000,000 shares of common stock would be reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The proposed increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Omnibus Plan represents approximately 1.42% of Cadence's outstanding common stock as of the Record Date. 
As of February 25, 2019, there were 8,532,454 shares of common stock available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan, and there were 13,522,128 shares subject to outstanding awards under the Omnibus Plan and its predecessor plans. 
All of the shares that are available under the Omnibus Plan may be used for any type of award permitted under the Omnibus Plan (whether stock options, incentive stock awards or RSUs). If an award under the Omnibus Plan (or its predecessor plans) should expire, become unexercisable, be forfeited or otherwise terminate for any reason without having vested or been exercised in full, then the unpurchased or forfeited shares that were subject to the award will, unless the Omnibus Plan has been terminated, become available for future grant under the Omnibus Plan. However, shares subject to an award may not again be made available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan if such shares are: (i) shares used to pay the exercise price of an option, (ii) shares delivered to or withheld by Cadence to pay the withholding taxes related to an award or (iii) shares that Cadence repurchases on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise. 
Stock Option Provisions 
The following describes the permissible terms of the stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan. Individual stock option grants may be more restrictive as to any or all of these permissible terms. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Exercise Price. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan may not be less than the  fair market value of Cadence common stock on the grant date. In the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder, the exercise price of the option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. The fair  market value for purposes of the Omnibus Plan is the closing price of Cadence common stock on the grant date as reported by Nasdaq.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payment of Exercise Price. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan may be paid by  cash, check, shares of Cadence common stock with a fair market value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares as to which the option is being exercised, or any combination of these methods, or such other  consideration and payment method as may be determined by the Board. In determining the type of consideration to accept, the Board considers whether the acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit Cadence. The particular  forms of consideration available to exercise a specific stock option are set forth in the terms of the option agreement for that option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Option Exercise. Stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan become exercisable at the times and under the  conditions determined by the Board and set forth in terms of the option agreement for that option. The Board has the power to accelerate the time at which a stock option may first be exercised or the time during which a stock option will vest.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Term. The maximum term of stock options granted under the Omnibus Plan is seven years. However, the maximum  term of incentive stock options granted to a 10% stockholder is five years. Stock options  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] 34               
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     granted under the Omnibus Plan generally terminate three months (twelve months in the case of termination due to death or disability), or such other period of time as determined by the Board,  after termination of the optionee's employment or consulting relationship with Cadence or one of its affiliates.  
[END TABLE]
Incentive Stock Award and Restricted Stock Unit Provisions 
The following describes the permissible terms of the grant of restricted stock ("incentive stock awards") and RSUs under the Omnibus Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sales Price and Payment of Sales Price. The Board determines the price, if any, at which shares subject to  incentive stock awards or shares underlying RSUs are sold or awarded to a participant under the Omnibus Plan, subject to applicable law. The sales price may vary among participants and may be below the fair market value of the shares of common stock  on the grant date. The Board also determines the form of consideration that may be used to pay the sales price, if any, of shares subject to incentive stock awards or shares underlying RSUs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting. The grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of incentive stock awards and RSUs granted under the  Omnibus Plan occur at the times and in the installments determined by the Board. The timing of the grant, the issuance, the ability to retain shares and the vesting of incentive stock awards and RSUs may be subject to continued service, the passage  of time and/or the performance criteria as the Board deems appropriate as described below. However, if the vesting of the incentive stock awards or RSUs granted to an executive officer is based solely on continued service, the award may not vest in  full sooner than three years after the grant date and may not have a vesting schedule more favorable, at any point in time, than what would become vested under a monthly pro rata vesting schedule (i.e., 1/36th per month) over those  three years. If vesting of an award granted to an executive officer is also subject to the achievement of performance criteria, the award may not vest in full sooner than one year after the grant date. The Board may accelerate the vesting of  incentive stock awards and RSUs in the event of a participant's termination of service as an employee or consultant, a change in control of Cadence or a similar event.  
[END TABLE]

• Performance Criteria. The Board may establish performance criteria for the grant, vesting or retention of any  incentive stock award or RSU. Under the Omnibus Plan, performance criteria may consist of any one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied either to Cadence as a whole or to a  Cadence business unit, segment or affiliate, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured over a performance period determined by the Board, on an absolute basis or relative to a  pre-established target, to previous results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Board in the agreement relating to the incentive stock award or RSU (and in each case on a GAAP  or non-GAAP basis, if applicable): (a) cash flow (including measures of operating or free cash flow), (b) earnings per share (diluted or basic), (c) earnings per share from continuing  operations, (d) earnings (including but not limited to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), (e) return on equity, (f) total stockholder return, (g) return on capital, (h) return on assets or net  assets, (i) revenue or revenue growth, (j) income or net income, (k) operating income or net operating income, (l) operating profit or net operating profit, (m) operating margin, (n) return on operating revenue,  (o) market share, (p) customer loyalty or satisfaction as measured by a customer loyalty or satisfaction index determined by an independent consultant or expert in measuring such matters, (q) return on investment, (r) stock  price, (s) market capitalization, (t) cash from operations, (u) product innovation or release schedule, (v) capital expenditure, (w) working capital, (x) cost of capital, (y) cost reductions, (z) bookings and  segments of bookings such as net product bookings, (aa) market penetration, (bb) technology development or proliferation or (cc) any other performance criteria selected by the Board, whether or not listed in the Omnibus Plan.

 evaluations, despite the satisfaction of any performance criteria. In addition, the Board may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance with respect to any performance criteria to exclude any of the following events that occurs during a performance period: (a) asset write-downs; (b) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; (d) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs; and (e) any unusual or infrequently occurring items as described in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Cadence's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year. 
Effect of Certain Corporate Events 
The Omnibus Plan provides that, in the event of a change in control of Cadence, the surviving or acquiring corporation will assume the awards outstanding under the Omnibus Plan or substitute similar awards. If the surviving or acquiring corporation does not assume such awards or substitute similar awards, (i) the vesting of awards held by participants then providing services to Cadence as an employee or consultant will be accelerated prior to the change in control event and will terminate if not exercised after such acceleration and at, or prior to, such event, and (ii) all other option awards outstanding under the Omnibus Plan, if any, will terminate if not exercised prior to the change in control event. 
Adjustment Provisions 
Upon an increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Cadence common stock resulting from a stock split, the payment of a stock dividend or any other increase or decrease effected without receipt of consideration by Cadence, the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Omnibus Plan, the number of shares covered by each outstanding award and the price per share of common stock covered by each outstanding award, will be equitably adjusted for any increase or decrease. 
Duration, Amendment and Termination 
The Board may terminate the Omnibus Plan without stockholder approval at any time. If the amendment of the Omnibus Plan is approved by Cadence stockholders, the Omnibus Plan will terminate on May 2, 2029, unless it is sooner terminated. Otherwise, the Omnibus Plan will terminate on May 3, 2028, unless it is sooner terminated. However, any termination of the Omnibus Plan will not adversely affect awards previously granted, and awards will remain in full force and effect unless mutually agreed upon in a writing signed by the participant and Cadence. 
The Board may also amend the Omnibus Plan at any time or from time to time. However, if the amendment would require stockholder approval to comply with any securities exchange or national market system listing requirements or any other applicable law, the amendment will not be effective unless approved by the stockholders before or after its adoption by the Board. Any amendment of the Omnibus Plan will not adversely affect awards previously granted unless mutually agreed upon in a writing signed by the participant and Cadence. 
Restrictions on Transfer 
Under the Omnibus Plan, except as specifically provided in an award agreement, an award may not be transferred by the participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, during the lifetime of the participant, may be exercised only by the participant or the participant's legal representative. However, the participant may designate in writing a third party who may exercise the stock option in the event of the participant's death. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 36               
[END TABLE]
FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION 
The following is only a summary of the federal income tax consequences with respect to the grant and exercise of awards under the Omnibus Plan based upon applicable federal law as currently in effect, is not complete, does not discuss the income tax laws of any locality, state or foreign country in which a participant may reside, and is subject to change. Participants in the Omnibus Plan should consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of participating in the Omnibus Plan. 
Nonstatutory Stock Options 
Options granted under the Omnibus Plan that are not intended to qualify as incentive stock options are referred to in this proxy statement as nonstatutory stock options ("NSOs"). A participant will not recognize any taxable income when an NSO is granted. A participant will generally recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of an NSO equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date exceeds the exercise price. The ordinary income recognized by an employee participant will be subject to applicable tax withholding, including applicable income and employment taxes. 
Upon the disposition of the shares acquired upon exercise of an NSO, the participant will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the sum of the exercise price plus the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant as a result of the exercise of the NSO. Any such gain or loss will generally be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on whether the holding period for the shares exceeds one year at the time of the disposition. 
Cadence will generally be entitled to a deduction to the extent a participant realizes ordinary income upon the exercise of an NSO, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. 
Incentive Stock Options 
The Omnibus Plan permits grants of incentive stock options ("ISOs"). ISOs granted under the Omnibus Plan are intended to be eligible for the favorable federal income tax treatment accorded to "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, a participant will not recognize any taxable income at the time of the grant of an ISO. In addition, the participant will not recognize income for regular federal income or employment tax purposes (except for alternative minimum tax purposes) at the time of exercise of an ISO. Cadence is not entitled to a deduction at the time of the grant or exercise of an ISO. 
If the participant holds the shares acquired through the exercise of an ISO for at least one year from the date of exercise and two years from the grant date, referred to in this proxy statement as the ISO holding period, the participant generally will realize long-term capital gain or loss upon disposition of the shares. This gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition of the shares and the exercise price of the shares. 
If a participant disposes of the shares acquired through the exercise of an ISO before expiration of the ISO holding period, referred to in this proxy statement as a disqualifying disposition, the participant will have: (i) ordinary income equal to the lesser of (a) the amount by which the sales price of such shares exceeds the exercise price and (b) the amount by which the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price; (ii) in the event that the sales price exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, capital gain equal to the amount by which the sales price of such shares exceeds the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise; and (iii) in the event that the sales price is less than the exercise price, capital loss equal to the amount by which the exercise price exceeds the sales price of such shares. 
In the event of a disqualifying disposition, Cadence will generally be entitled to a deduction to the extent that the participant realizes ordinary income as a result of the disqualifying disposition, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               37 
[END TABLE]
Incentive Stock Awards 
A participant who receives an incentive stock award subject to restrictions that constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture generally will not recognize any taxable income upon the award of the shares. When the restrictions constituting a substantial risk of forfeiture on the shares subsequently lapse, the participant will recognize ordinary income in the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the date such restrictions lapse exceeds the purchase price (if any) paid for the shares. However, a participant who makes a timely election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to shares subject to restrictions constituting a substantial risk of forfeiture will instead recognize ordinary income in the year the incentive stock award is granted equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the award date exceeds the purchase price (if any) paid for the shares and will not recognize any additional ordinary income when the restrictions on those shares subsequently lapse. 
Cadence will generally be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by a participant in connection with the grant or vesting, as applicable, of shares of Cadence common stock pursuant to an incentive stock award, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. 
RSUs 
Participants who are granted unvested RSUs do not recognize income at the time of the grant. When the award vests or is paid, participants generally recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of any shares delivered and the amount of any cash paid to the participant, and Cadence will receive a corresponding deduction, except to the extent the deduction limits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code apply. 
Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits to $1,000,000 the amount that a publicly held corporation is allowed to deduct each year for the compensation paid to a "covered employee." A "covered employee" is any individual serving as the corporation's principal executive officer or principal financial officer at any time during the taxable year, the corporation's three other most highly compensated executive officers, and any individual who was a covered employee of the corporation (or any predecessor) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. 
STOCK PRICE 
On the Record Date, the closing price of Cadence common stock as reported by Nasdaq was $58.54. 
NEW PLAN BENEFITS 
Because the Board has the discretion to grant awards under the Omnibus Plan, it is not possible as of the date of this proxy statement to determine future awards that will be received by executive officers and other employees under the Omnibus Plan. During fiscal 2018, the following awards were granted in the aggregate under the Omnibus Plan: awards for an aggregate of 869,924 shares to all current executive officers and an aggregate of 3,765,885 shares to other employees. See the table entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" for grants made to each of the named executive officers (as defined below in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis") during fiscal 2018. 
As of February 25, 2019, since the approval of the Omnibus Plan by Cadence stockholders in May 2014, awards covering 32,815,087 shares had been granted under the Omnibus Plan, including awards that were subsequently forfeited (and therefore the shares underlying the awards became available for grant under the Omnibus Plan).

VOTING INFORMATION AND BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board recommends a vote FOR approval of the amendment of the Omnibus Plan. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of the proposal. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will be treated as not being entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted FOR approval of the amendment of the Omnibus Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               39 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIED CORPORATE ACTIONS 
Cadence is requesting that Cadence stockholders approve amendments to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") to eliminate supermajority vote requirements and implement a majority of outstanding voting stock voting standard for specified corporate actions. Our Charter currently requires certain corporate actions to be approved by a vote of not less than 66% of the outstanding voting stock. The proposed amendments would replace all supermajority voting provisions in the Charter that apply to Cadence's common stock with a majority of the outstanding voting shares standard. 
Article VIII of the Charter requires certain "business combinations" (as defined in the Charter) with or involving a "related person" (i.e., a person or entity that, individually or with others, beneficially owns 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of Cadence) to be approved by the holders of not less than 66% of the outstanding voting stock and by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the "disinterested shares" (as defined in the Charter), unless the business combination is approved by the continuing directors who are unaffiliated with the related person. The requirement of 66% of the outstanding voting stock does not apply if certain fair price conditions are met. 
Article IX of the Charter requires amendments of Article VIII of the Charter and Article IX of the Charter to be approved by (i) a majority of the authorized number of directors and if a "related person" exists, by a majority of the continuing directors who are unaffiliated with the related person; or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66% of the outstanding voting stock and if the change is proposed by or on behalf of a related person or a director affiliated with a related person, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the disinterested shares. 
REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIFIED CORPORATE ACTIONS 
Cadence has reviewed the protections offered by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and has determined that Cadence continues to be subject to and benefit from Section 203 of the DGCL. Pursuant to Section 203 of the DGCL, once a stockholder reaches a 15% ownership threshold, such stockholder is prohibited for a period of three years from consummating a broad range of business combination transactions with Cadence, unless (a) the business combination is approved in advance by the Board, (b) the Board approved the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming a 15% owner, (c) the business combination is approved by holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding voting stock not held by such stockholder, or (d) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming a 15% owner, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the outstanding shares of voting stock of Cadence outstanding at the time the transaction commenced (with some exclusions). Though there are differences between the vote requirements under Article VIII of the Charter and Section 203 of the DGCL, the Board believes that Section 203 of the DGCL and Article VIII of the Charter (as amended pursuant to this proposal) provide Cadence with appropriate protection from unfair acquisition attempts. 
Our Board recognizes that many stockholders believe that a majority vote requirement will provide stockholders with a greater voice in expressing their views on matters impacting a corporation. On the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and based on the careful review of the advantages and disadvantages retaining or replacing the vote required under Articles VIII and IX of the Charter as described above, the Board has determined that amending the vote requirements as described above is in the best interests of Cadence and its stockholders (the "Charter Amendments"). In furtherance thereof, the Board has approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, this proposal to implement the Charter Amendments. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 40               
[END TABLE]
The Charter Amendments are set forth in Appendix B to this proxy statement with deletions indicated by strike-outs and additions indicated by underlining, and the summary of the Charter Amendments contained in this proposal is qualified by the full text of the proposed Charter Amendments in Appendix B. 
VOTING INFORMATION AND BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board recommends a vote FOR approval of the amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate supermajority vote requirements for specified corporate actions. 
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding voting stock of Cadence. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of votes against the proposal. If this proposal is approved by stockholders, the Board has authorized the officers of Cadence to file with the Delaware Secretary of State a restatement of our Charter incorporating the Charter Amendments set forth in Appendix B. Such restated Charter will become effective on the date it is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later effective date set forth in the restated Charter). If this proposal is not approved by the requisite vote, the Charter Amendments will not be implemented and the current vote requirements set forth in Articles VIII and IX of the Charter will remain in place.

PROPOSAL 4: ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Cadence stockholders are entitled to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of Cadence's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. This proposal, which is commonly known as the "say-on-pay" proposal, provides stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the named executive officers' compensation. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee value feedback from Cadence stockholders on compensation and will review and consider the voting results when evaluating Cadence's executive compensation program. At the 2018 annual meeting of Cadence stockholders, approximately 96% of votes cast by Cadence stockholders approved the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in the 2018 proxy statement. 
In deciding how to vote on this proposal, stockholders are encouraged to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the related tables and narrative in this proxy statement for the details of Cadence's executive compensation program. As described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below, the Board and the Compensation Committee designed Cadence's executive compensation program to support the long-term success of Cadence and the creation of stockholder value. Cadence's executive compensation program for fiscal 2018 tied a significant majority of the named executive officers' compensation to performance. As a result, the pay-for-performance component in Cadence's executive compensation program should be considered an important factor in Cadence's strong performance in fiscal 2018, including revenue of $2.138 billion. 
The Board and the Compensation Committee believe that the leadership provided by Cadence's management team, including Mr. Tan, who was appointed Cadence's CEO in January 2009, and the other named executive officers, was key to Cadence's execution and strong performance in fiscal 2018, which contributed to a total stockholder return of 108% over the past three fiscal years and 1,029% over the past ten fiscal years. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Cadence is asking its stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Cadence's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," compensation tables and narrative discussion in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED. 
VOTING INFORMATION AND BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the advisory resolution to approve named executive officer compensation. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of the proposal. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will be treated as not being entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will not be counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved.

PROPOSAL 5: RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP as Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019. Pursuant to the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee and the Board have directed management to submit the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. KPMG LLP has audited Cadence's financial statements since fiscal 2002. Representatives from KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by Cadence's Bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If Cadence stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain KPMG LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Cadence and its stockholders. 
VOTING INFORMATION AND BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposal. This proposal is considered a routine matter, and brokers are therefore permitted to vote shares held by them without instruction from the beneficial owners of the shares. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted FOR ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee is currently comprised of three non-employee directors of Cadence who are "independent" as defined by Nasdaq's listing standards and the Exchange Act. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee was comprised of Mr. Siboni and Drs. Plummer and Shoven. Mr. Siboni served as the Audit Committee's Chair. The Audit Committee met six times in fiscal 2018. 
The Audit Committee operates under a charter that was last amended by the Board in February 2019. The Audit Committee charter is available on the corporate governance page of Cadence's website at www.cadence.com. As more fully described in its charter, the Audit Committee appoints and retains the independent registered public accounting firm and oversees the quality and integrity of Cadence's financial statements, Cadence's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance, and the performance of Cadence's internal audit function, Cadence's accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of Cadence's financial statements on behalf of the Board. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements included in Cadence's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 with Cadence's management and KPMG LLP, Cadence's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board auditing standards (Communications with Audit Committees), as well as KPMG LLP's independence from Cadence and its management. In addition, the Audit Committee has received from KPMG LLP the written report regarding these matters and KPMG LLP's independence, as required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by KPMG LLP to Cadence is compatible with KPMG LLP's independence. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the current members of the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in Cadence's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP prior to the engagement of KPMG LLP with respect to such services. Pursuant to its pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee has pre-approved specified audit services, audit-related services, tax compliance services and tax planning and related tax services. 
However, engagements for these pre-approved audit-related and tax services with an estimated cost of more than $250,000 or that exceed the applicable budgeted amount for the pre-approved services must be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee, or, if the Chair is unavailable, another member of the Audit Committee. In addition, any proposed engagement of KPMG LLP for services that are not pre-approved audit-related and tax services as described above must also be pre-approved on a case-by-case basis by the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee, or, if the Chair is unavailable, another member of the Audit Committee. The members to whom such authority is delegated must report any approval decisions to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the fees reported in the table above were pre-approved in accordance with these procedures.

Cadence's Fiscal 2018 Compensation Highlights 
Cadence's fiscal 2018 executive compensation program was designed to be consistent with its executive compensation principles, pay-for-performance philosophy and commitment to sound corporate governance, as summarized below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant Majority of NEOs' Direct Compensation was At-Risk  Compensation. The graphics below show that the fiscal 2018 target direct compensation for each NEO was weighted towards at-risk, variable incentive awards (in the form of both short-term cash  incentives and equity incentives).

• Focused Cash Compensation Increases. The only changes in target cash compensation for the NEOs in fiscal 2018  were base salary increases of approximately 4% for each of Messrs. Tan and Wall, and increases in cash bonus targets, as a percentage of base salary, for Messrs. Tan (from 100% to 125%) and Mandava (from 75% to 100%). Mr. Tan's cash  bonus target as a percentage of base salary had been 100% since his appointment as CEO in 2009.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to Severance Arrangements. In connection with the increases to Messrs. Tan and Mandava's cash  compensation described above and for certain other reasons, the severance provisions of Mr. Tan's employment agreement and the terms of Mr. Mandava's participation in Cadence's Executive Severance Plan were amended in March  2018 to increase certain severance payments, as described below under "Severance Benefits."  
[END TABLE]
See "Elements of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation" below for a more detailed discussion of Cadence's fiscal 2018 executive compensation program. 
Cadence's Executive Compensation Practices 
Cadence continued its commitment to sound corporate governance in its fiscal 2018 executive compensation program, as demonstrated by the following highlights: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clawback Policy. Cadence has a clawback policy that is applicable to the executive officers' performance-based compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anti-Hedging Policy. Cadence's Securities Trading Policy prohibits hedging, short-sales and similar  transactions by Cadence employees, including its executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Tax Gross-Ups. Cadence did not provide tax gross-ups to any of its executive officers with respect to taxable income and executive officers are not entitled to receive tax gross-ups in connection with a change in  control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regular Compensation Risk Review. The Compensation Committee conducts a formal review of the risks associated  with Cadence's executive compensation practices, policies and programs on an annual basis and assesses such risks as part of its regular decision-making process.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. All of Cadence's executive officers are in compliance with Cadence's  Stock Ownership Guidelines, which require ownership of shares of Cadence common stock with a value equal to or greater than 3 times annual base salary for Cadence's CEO and equal to the annual base salary for Cadence's other executive  officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee engages its own compensation consultant,  Semler Brossy, which does not provide any services to management or otherwise to Cadence and has no prior relationship with any of Cadence's executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] 50               
[END TABLE]
SAY-ON-PAY 
At the 2018 annual meeting of Cadence stockholders, stockholders again expressed strong support for Cadence's executive compensation program, with approximately 96% of the votes cast for approval of the advisory "say-on-pay" vote. 
DETERMINING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Executive Compensation Objectives 
Cadence is engaged in a very competitive industry, and its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified, talented and creative executives with the leadership and innovation skills necessary to achieve Cadence's annual and long-term business objectives. Cadence seeks to accomplish these objectives by means that are designed to be aligned with the long-term interests of its stockholders. 
Cadence's executive compensation program is based on the following principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total direct compensation and other compensation elements are targeted to be competitive with peer companies and market  practice, taking into account each executive officer's scope of responsibility, impact, criticality and individual performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A substantial portion of compensation of the executive officers is at-risk and is  highly dependent on Cadence's short-term and long-term financial, operational and stock performance.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee oversees the executive compensation program and assesses executive compensation on a continuous basis to monitor Cadence's adherence to these principles. The executive compensation program is designed to be results-oriented and dependent on the achievement of key financial goals, strategic objectives and the long-term performance of Cadence's stock. 
Competitive Compensation Levels 
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee assessed the competitiveness of each element of the executive officers' total direct compensation against Cadence's peer group, as discussed below. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews the competitiveness of the executive officers' severance and change in control arrangements and the broad-based employee benefit plans in which the executive officers participate. 
In particular, the Compensation Committee considered the competitiveness of the executive officers' compensation as compared to executives with similar titles and responsibilities at companies with which Cadence competes for talent (the "Peer Group"). In order to accurately reflect the pool from which executive talent is drawn and to which it is lost, the Peer Group includes publicly listed companies located throughout the U.S. that are deemed comparable to Cadence in revenue, market capitalization and scope, are in similar technical fields, and compete in the same talent market as Cadence, each as further described in the Peer Group selection criteria chart below. The Peer Group excludes companies that are foreign or are in businesses or industries that are not considered by the Compensation Committee to be reasonably comparable.

[END TABLE]
In August 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the Peer Group for fiscal 2018. The median revenue of the companies included in the fiscal 2018 Peer Group was approximately $2.15 billion (calculated based on the most recently available trailing four fiscal quarters as of June 29, 2017). Cadence's revenue for the same period was approximately $1.85 billion. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee added two companies that were not part of the Peer Group for fiscal 2017, based on the selection criteria described above, and removed three companies that were acquired, resulting in a fiscal 2018 Peer Group of 22 companies. 
The Peer Group approved by the Compensation Committee for determining fiscal 2018 competitive compensation levels is comprised of the following companies:

When appropriate, the Compensation Committee supplements the competitive analysis of Peer Group compensation practices with other data sources. Given the limited number of comparable positions in the Peer Group for Mr. Devgan, the Peer Group data was supplemented in 2018 with an analysis of compensation practices at a broader set of companies in the software, hardware, and semiconductor industries with a revenue range of approximately one-third to three times Cadence's revenue. Additional companies reviewed include Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Brooks Automation, Inc., Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc., GoDaddy, Inc., Open Text Corp., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., SS&C Technologies, Inc., Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc., and Workday, Inc. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 52               
[END TABLE]
Compensation Determinations 
Consistent with the principles of Cadence's executive compensation outlined above, after the Compensation Committee determines the market levels of each executive officer's compensation based on the compensation paid by the companies in the Peer Group, the Compensation Committee assesses each executive officer's compensation relative to compensation levels among executives with similar titles and responsibilities in the Peer Group. For the purposes of this assessment, the Compensation Committee considered the annual base salary, short-term cash incentive compensation, grants of equity incentive compensation (based on the grant date fair value of such equity awards), and any long-term equity awards subject to stockholder return targets. Cadence does not target executive compensation at a specific level or percentile relative to compensation provided by the companies in the Peer Group, whether for total direct compensation or any element of executive compensation. Instead, when determining compensation for the executive officers, the Compensation Committee takes into account each of the following compensation factors, without prescribing particular weightings: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cadence Compensation Factors:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cadence's financial and operational performance as compared to the performance of the companies in the Peer Group

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee retains and does not delegate any of its responsibility to determine executive compensation. However, for executive officers other than the CEO, the CEO makes assessments and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on their respective base salaries, short-term cash incentive compensation and equity incentive compensation based upon an assessment of the "Cadence Compensation Factors" and the "Individual Compensation Factors" outlined above. 
The Compensation Committee then reviews these assessments and recommendations and determines whether to approve or modify the CEO's recommendations. The Compensation Committee also evaluates the CEO based on the compensation factors described above, and the assessment from such evaluation is used to determine the CEO's compensation. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, makes all decisions related to the CEO's and the other NEOs' compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               53 
[END TABLE]
ELEMENTS OF FISCAL 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The fiscal 2018 compensation of Cadence's executive officers, including the NEOs, was comprised of the following main elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total direct compensation, consisting of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term cash incentive compensation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity incentive compensation (including stock options and incentive stock awards)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other compensation and benefits, consisting of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broad-based employee benefit plans  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-qualified deferred compensation plan  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance benefits  
[END TABLE]
Consistent with the principles of Cadence's executive compensation outlined above, an executive officer's total direct compensation is based on Cadence's performance and on the performance of the individual executive officer, as well as on the Compensation Committee's view of the level of total direct compensation sufficient to attract, motivate and retain qualified executives. The Compensation Committee also grants long-term equity awards subject to stockholder return targets (the "LTP Awards") from time to time to further align executive compensation with stockholder return. Cadence does not have a pre-established policy or target for allocating compensation between fixed and variable pay elements or for allocating among the different types of variable compensation, although the allocation is influenced by the Compensation Committee's assessment of the compensation practices of the companies in the Peer Group and Cadence's short-term and long-term strategic objectives. The Compensation Committee believes that the executive compensation program should motivate the executive officers to drive strong and sustained performance for Cadence. Accordingly, the executive officers' compensation is weighted towards at-risk, variable incentive awards — equity incentives and short-term cash incentives — rather than base salaries. 
Base Salaries 
Cadence offers its executive officers an annual base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the year. Base salaries are considered essential for the attraction and retention of talented executive officers and are determined using the compensation factors described above. The executive officers' base salaries are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, but do not automatically or necessarily increase each year. Changes to the executive officers' base salaries, if any, are typically made in the first quarter of the fiscal year or in connection with an executive officer's promotion or change in responsibilities. 
In February 2018, consistent with the process discussed under "Compensation Determinations" above, the Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries of the NEOs. Mr. Tan's base salary was increased from $700,000 to $725,000, and Mr. Wall's base salary was increased from $360,000 to $375,000. The base salary increases for Messrs. Tan and Wall were intended to bring their target cash compensation more in line with competitive market levels for their respective positions. The Compensation Committee determined that the base salaries for Messrs. Devgan, Mandava and Zaman were appropriate and would remain unchanged.

Short-Term Cash Incentive Compensation under the Senior Executive Bonus Plan 
Overview. Cadence provides its executive officers with the opportunity to earn short-term cash incentive compensation under its Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "SEBP"). The purpose of the SEBP is to reward executive officers for performance during a single fiscal year (or portions thereof) and to provide incentives for them to achieve Cadence's short-term financial and operational goals, as measured against specific performance criteria relative to Cadence's overall business results and individual performance. Cash bonus payouts under the SEBP for fiscal 2018 were determined semi-annually based on base salary earned in each half of the fiscal year. 
For each executive officer other than the CEO, the CEO makes an assessment and recommendation as to the individual's target bonus. The Compensation Committee reviews the CEO's recommendation, as described above under "Compensation Determinations," and approves (with or without modification, in its sole discretion) the CEO's recommendation. For the CEO, the Compensation Committee is solely responsible for assigning a target bonus based on its review of the performance of Cadence and the CEO, as described above under "Compensation Determinations." 
In February 2018, consistent with the process discussed under "Compensation Determinations" above, the Compensation Committee reviewed the target bonus levels of the NEOs. Mr. Tan's target bonus level as a percentage of base salary was increased from 100% to 125%, and Mr. Mandava's target bonus level as a percentage of base salary was increased from 75% to 100%. Mr. Tan's target bonus level as a percentage of base salary had been 100% since his appointment as CEO in 2009. The target bonus level increases for Messrs. Tan and Mandava were intended to bring their target cash compensation more in line with competitive market levels for their respective positions. The Compensation Committee determined that the fiscal 2017 target bonus levels as a percentage of base salary for Messrs. Wall, Devgan and Zaman were appropriate and would remain unchanged for fiscal 2018.

Overview. Consistent with the principles of Cadence's compensation for its executive officers outlined above, equity incentives are designed to provide executive officers with an ownership stake in Cadence, promote stock ownership to align the executive officers' interests with those of other Cadence stockholders, and create significant incentives for executive retention. Specifically, equity incentives in the form of stock options provide an opportunity for Cadence to reward its executive officers solely to the extent Cadence's stock price increases from the date of grant over time, which aligns the interests of executive officers with those of Cadence stockholders, and the executive officers must remain employed at Cadence during the period required for the stock options to vest. Furthermore, equity incentive awards in the form of incentive stock awards align the interests of executive officers with the interests of stockholders through stock ownership, require continued employment of the executive throughout the vesting period, and increase in value when Cadence's stock price increases. The vesting of incentive stock awards granted to Cadence's executive officers is also subject to the achievement of performance goals originally intended to qualify the awards under the historical exemption for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code before passage of the Tax Act. The Compensation Committee continued to maintain the performance goal requirement for incentive stock award grants made in fiscal 2018. 
Additionally, as an important component of executive officers' equity incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee has made periodic grants of LTP Awards. The Compensation Committee granted LTP Awards to all then-serving executive officers in fiscal 2016, and to Messrs. Tan, Mandava and Wall in fiscal 2017. The Compensation Committee also granted LTP Awards to the executive officers in fiscal 2019. The Compensation Committee, with input and collaboration from its independent compensation consultant, designed the LTP Awards to further focus the executive officers to build on Cadence's strong, sustained levels of growth, provide a pay opportunity for exceptional market performance by Cadence, and inspire innovation and resourcefulness to achieve Cadence's strategic priorities over a multi-year performance period, all of which the Compensation Committee believes will incentivize strong stockholder value creation. By design, the LTP Awards provide value to the recipients only if there is a significant increase in stockholder value during the multi-year performance period of the awards, as further described under "Outstanding LTP Awards" and "2019 LTP Awards" below. The Compensation Committee will continue to assess Cadence's equity incentive compensation program and may make future grants of LTP Awards, with similar or different design parameters, as it deems appropriate. 
When the Compensation Committee determines and approves individual equity grants to executive officers, it considers each of the compensation factors, without prescribing particular weightings to any of the compensation factors. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews the CEO's assessments and recommendations as to the equity compensation for all of the executive officers except himself. 
Fiscal 2018 Equity Grants. The Compensation Committee believes equity incentive grants provide the appropriate level of executive alignment with Cadence stockholder interests, reward Cadence's executives for 
[BEGIN TABLE] 58               
[END TABLE]
 building long-term stockholder value, and create balance among stock options (which provide value only if the stock price increases), incentive stock awards (which provide more certain retention value subject to the fulfillment of certain vesting conditions, while still providing incentive to improve Cadence's stock performance), and LTP Awards (which provide value only if significant long-term stockholder return is achieved). 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved stock option and incentive stock award grants for the NEOs. No LTP Awards were granted in fiscal 2018. Approximately 50% of the CEO's fiscal 2018 equity grants (based on grant date fair value calculated pursuant to FASB ASC 718) consisted of stock options, and approximately 34% of the other NEOs' fiscal 2018 equity grants in the aggregate consisted of stock options, with the remainder of the equity grants being incentive stock awards. The Compensation Committee continued to place significant weight on stock options to focus on stock price appreciation over the seven-year term of the stock option. The stock options granted to the NEOs in February 2018 vest monthly over four years from the date of grant and expire seven years from the date of grant. The incentive stock awards granted to the NEOs in February 2018 vest in equal semi-annual installments over three years from the date of grant, subject to achievement of the performance goal requirement mentioned above. 
Outstanding LTP Awards. As noted above, beginning in fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee has granted LTP Awards to incentivize executives to drive strong, sustained increases in stockholder value over a multi-year period. The LTP Awards are intended to create additional incentives to continue execution on and commitment to leading product innovation, provide industry-leading customer service and increase product proliferation during a time of industry transition. Vesting of the LTP Awards is based on meeting specific cumulative total stockholder return goals over a multi-year performance period, with the ability to vest in a portion of the award based on performance through March 15, 2019, March 15, 2020, and March 15, 2021. See "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End" below for further information regarding the performance goals under the LTP Awards. 
2019 LTP Awards. In March 2019, the Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to grant LTP Awards to Cadence's current executive officers to create additional incentives that extend beyond the stockholder return objectives and timeframe of the LTP Awards granted in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. The structure of the 2019 LTP Awards is generally consistent with the structure of Cadence's prior LTP Awards, with performance to be measured over a five-year performance period through 2024 and the ability to vest in a portion of the LTP Award earlier in the event interim performance goals are achieved. These grants are intended to provide value to the executive officers only if there is a significant and sustained increase in stockholder value over the five-year performance period. 
Grant Timing Policy 
The Compensation Committee and senior management monitor Cadence's equity grant policies to evaluate whether such policies comply with governing regulations and are consistent with good corporate practices. Grants to the executive officers are generally made at the Compensation Committee meeting held in February of each year, after results for the preceding fiscal year become available and after review and evaluation of each executive officer's performance, enabling the Compensation Committee to consider both the prior year's performance and expectations for the succeeding year in making grant decisions. However, the Compensation Committee may make grants at any time during the year it deems appropriate. 
Deferred Compensation 
In fiscal 2018, all of the NEOs were eligible to defer compensation payable to them under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained by Cadence (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Deferred Compensation Plan is designed to allow for salary deferral above the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for 401(k) plans on an income tax-deferred basis. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors and selected employees who are classified as officers, vice presidents, directors, or an equivalent title are eligible to participate. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are held in accounts with values indexed to 
[BEGIN TABLE]               59 
[END TABLE]
 the performance of mutual funds or money market accounts selected by the participant. The investment options made available under the Deferred Compensation Plan are substantially similar to those available under Cadence's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Cadence does not match contributions made under the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and is subject to the claims of creditors, so that participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan have rights in the plan only as unsecured creditors. Cadence maintains the Deferred Compensation Plan for the purposes of providing a competitive benefit and allowing all participants, including the NEOs, an opportunity to defer income tax payments on their cash compensation. 
Other Employee Benefit Plans 
The executive officers, including the NEOs, are eligible for the same benefits generally available to Cadence employees. These include participation in a tax-qualified 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, and group life, health, dental, vision and disability insurance plans. Cadence does not currently offer guaranteed pension benefits. Cadence periodically assesses the competitiveness of its broad-based employee benefit plans. Cadence aims to provide benefits to its employees that are competitive with market practices. 
Perquisites 
In connection with Mr. Devgan's promotion to President in November 2017 and his required relocation to Cadence's corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, Cadence agreed to provide Mr. Devgan with certain relocation benefits. In fiscal 2018, Mr. Devgan received a total of $54,000 for three months of housing allowance and $55,366 in reimbursement of moving expenses. Mr. Devgan's relocation-related income is included in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" section below. 
Cadence does not provide its executive officers with club memberships, financial planning assistance, personal use of private aircraft or tax gross-up payments with respect to any taxable income. 
Severance Benefits 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews typical industry practices concerning severance and change in control arrangements, and considers how those practices compare to Cadence's severance and change in control arrangements. Cadence has entered into agreements with Messrs. Tan and Devgan that provide for benefits upon termination of employment under certain circumstances, such as in connection with a change in control of Cadence. 
In fiscal 2016, Cadence adopted an Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which provides certain severance benefits to individuals promoted to or hired as executive officers of Cadence, to the extent designated as a participant in the Severance Plan by the Compensation Committee. Messrs. Mandava, Wall and Zaman have each been designated as a participant in the Severance Plan. In designing the Severance Plan, the Compensation Committee structured the severance benefit levels based on Cadence's historical practices, as reflected in the executive employment agreements in place with Messrs. Tan and Devgan. 
Cadence provides these severance benefits as a means of retaining executive officers, focusing executive officers on stockholder interests when considering strategic alternatives and providing income protection in the event of involuntary loss of employment. In general, the employment agreements and the Severance Plan provide for severance benefits upon Cadence's termination of the executive's employment without "cause." The employment agreements but not the Severance Plan provide severance benefits upon resignation by the executive in connection with a "constructive termination" without a change in control. In the event of a change in control of Cadence, and if the executive's employment is terminated without "cause" or by the executive in connection with a "constructive termination," the executive will receive enhanced severance benefits. Accordingly, Cadence provides for enhanced severance benefits only in the event of a "double trigger" because it believes that the executive officers would be materially harmed only if a change in control results in reduced responsibilities or compensation, or loss of employment. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 60               
[END TABLE]
In March 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an amendment to Mr. Tan's employment agreement to increase the lump sum payable at his Second Transition Payment Date (defined below under the section entitled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control") to (i) 125% of his annual base salary for a termination of employment without "cause" or a "constructive termination" not in connection with a change in control and (ii) 187.5% of his annual base salary for a termination without "cause" or a "constructive termination" in connection with a change in control, in each case subject to the other terms and conditions of the agreement. 
At such time, the Compensation Committee also approved an amendment to the terms of Mr. Mandava's participation in the Severance Plan to generally increase his benefits from the one-half level provided to him when he initially joined Cadence to the full level typically provided to other participating executive officers, and to reflect the increase in his target cash compensation that occurred in fiscal 2018. Such amendment was made in recognition of Mr. Mandava's service at Cadence since January 2017. 
See "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below for a more detailed discussion of the severance and change in control arrangements with the NEOs. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
Cadence's Stock Ownership Guidelines require that Cadence's executive officers hold shares of Cadence common stock with a value equal to or greater than a specific value, as set forth below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Position       Minimum Value of Shares       Years to Meet Guidelines   
   Position       Minimum Value of Shares       Years to Meet Guidelines   
   Chief Executive Officer       3X annual base salary       5 years   
   Chief Executive Officer       3X annual base salary       5 years   
   Other Executive Officers       1X annual base salary       5 years   
   Other Executive Officers       1X annual base salary       5 years   
[END TABLE]
These guidelines are designed to further align the interests of Cadence's executive officers with the interests of stockholders and to reinforce Cadence's commitment to sound corporate governance. As of December 28, 2018 (the last trading day of Cadence's fiscal 2018), all of the NEOs satisfied Cadence's Stock Ownership Guidelines. 
Compliance with the Stock Ownership Guidelines is measured on the last trading day of each fiscal year in which the guidelines are applicable (the "Ownership Measurement Date"), based on the average closing price of Cadence common stock during the 20 trading day period ending on the Ownership Measurement Date (the "Measurement Price"). 
Should any executive officer not meet the Stock Ownership Guidelines on the Ownership Measurement Date based on the Measurement Price or on any other date based on the closing price of Cadence common stock on such date, such executive officer is required to retain an amount equal to 100% of the "net shares" received as a result of the exercise, vesting or settlement of any Cadence equity award granted to such executive officer until the guideline is met. "Net shares" are those shares that remain after the shares are sold or withheld to pay any applicable exercise price or taxes for the award. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to grant a hardship exception to an executive officer if he or she fails to meet the guidelines as of the Ownership Measurement Date. 
The following forms of equity interests in Cadence count towards satisfaction of the Stock Ownership Guidelines: restricted or incentive shares (whether vested or unvested), shares subject to RSUs, shares obtained through Cadence's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), shares obtained through the exercise of stock options or upon settlement of restricted stock, shares purchased on the open market, shares owned outright by the executive officer or his or her immediate family members residing in the same household, shares held in trust for the benefit of the executive officer or his or her family and restricted shares granted under Cadence's equity plans. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               61 
[END TABLE]
CLAWBACK POLICY 
Cadence has adopted a clawback policy, which provides that if Cadence restates its reported financial results, the Board will review all bonuses and other awards made to the NEOs on the basis of having met or exceeded performance goals during the period covered by the restatement and will, to the extent practicable and considered in the best interests of stockholders, instruct Cadence to seek to recover or cancel such bonuses or awards to the extent that performance goals would not have been met under such restated financial results. 
ANTI-HEDGING POLICY AND TRADING RESTRICTIONS 
Cadence's Securities Trading Policy restricts certain transactions in Cadence securities and prohibits members of the Board, executive officers and all other Cadence employees (and their respective family and household members) from hedging their ownership of Cadence securities (regardless of whether such securities were granted as compensation or are otherwise held, directly or indirectly, by such employee or director), including by purchasing financial instruments such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, or trading in publicly traded options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Cadence securities. Cadence's Securities Trading Policy also prohibits short-sales and similar transactions, and requires approval by Cadence of pledges of Cadence stock or deposits of Cadence stock in margin accounts by certain employees, including its executive officers. None of the NEOs currently or in the last year has pledged any Cadence common stock under this policy. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The current members of the Compensation Committee have reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above with management. Based on this review and discussion, the current members of the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board the inclusion of the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this proxy statement and incorporation by reference into Cadence's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   In accordance with SEC rules, the amount shown reflects the grant date fair value of stock awards and option awards  granted during fiscal 2018 calculated pursuant to FASB ASC 718. The assumptions used to calculate the valuation of the awards for fiscal 2018 are set forth in Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Cadence's Annual Report  on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, and the assumptions used to calculate the valuation of the awards for prior years are set forth in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in Cadence's annual reports on Form 10-K for the corresponding years. While the grant date fair value of awards reflects the full value of the awards in the year of grant, the awards will be earned by the  holder over a number of years, and the stock awards are subject to performance conditions. The terms of the applicable awards are discussed in more detail in the tables entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" and  "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End." The amount shown is based on the price of Cadence common stock on the date the award was granted and does not reflect any fluctuations in the price of Cadence common stock subsequent to  the grant date. The amount shown therefore does not reflect the financial benefit that the holder of the award will actually realize upon the vesting of the award, and with respect to option awards, such amount does not reflect whether the option  award will be exercised or exercisable prior to its expiration.  
[END TABLE]

(2)   The market value of the stock awards that have not vested is calculated by multiplying the number of shares that have not  vested by the closing price of Cadence common stock on December 28, 2018 (the last business day of Cadence's fiscal 2018) of $43.34 per share.

(3)   Stock option was fully vested as of December 29, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)   Restricted stock was granted on February 8, 2016 and vests at a rate of 1/6th every six months from the date of grant  over three years, subject to the achievement of specific performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)   LTP Award was granted on February 8, 2016 and vests upon achieving total stockholder return between a threshold of  45.3% (corresponding to a $28 stock price, above which vesting begins) and a goal of 123.1% (corresponding to a $43 stock price, at or above which 100% vesting would occur) from the $19.27 trailing 20-day  average stock price as of February 8, 2016 (the original award grant date) through March 15, 2021 (the end of the award's multi-year term). The percentage of the grant that vests for total stockholder return in between the 45.3%  threshold and 123.1% goal values is based on a linear interpolation between these two amounts. Total stockholder return is calculated using a trailing 20-day average stock price and the corresponding stock  prices cited above assume that no dividends, stock splits or other similar adjustments have occurred. The LTP Award terms provide for the possibility of partial vesting on two interim measurement dates – March 15, 2019 and March 15, 2020 –  if total stockholder return reaches the vesting range by such dates, subject to vesting limits of 33% for the 2019 measurement date and 67% for the 2020 measurement date. No portion of the LTP Award would vest at any time unless Cadence's total  stockholder return from February 8, 2016 through the applicable measurement date is equal to or greater than the 35th percentile of the companies listed in the S&P MidCap 400 Information Technology Index as of February 8, 2016. On  March 15, 2019, 33% of the LTP Award vested.

(7)   LTP Award was granted on February 21, 2017 and vests upon achieving total stockholder return between a threshold of  40.6% (corresponding to a $40 stock price, above which vesting begins) and a goal of 75.8% (corresponding to a $50 stock price, at or above which 100% vesting would occur) from the $28.44 trailing 20-day  average stock price as of February 21, 2017 (the original award grant date) through March 15, 2021 (the end of the award's multi-year term). The percentage of the grant that vests for total stockholder return in between the 40.6%  threshold and 75.8% goal values is based on a linear interpolation between these two amounts. Total stockholder return is calculated using a trailing 20-day average stock price and the corresponding stock  prices cited above assume that no dividends, stock splits or other similar adjustments have occurred. The LTP Award terms provide for the possibility of partial vesting on two interim measurement dates – March 15, 2019 and March 15, 2020 –  if total stockholder return reaches the vesting range by such dates, subject to vesting limits of 33% for the 2019 measurement date and 67% for the 2020 measurement date. No portion of the LTP Award would vest at any time unless Cadence's total  stockholder return from February 21, 2017 through the applicable measurement date is equal to or greater than the 35th percentile of the companies listed in the S&P MidCap 400 Information Technology Index as of February 21, 2017.

(13)   LTP Award was granted on October 1, 2017 and vests upon achieving total stockholder return between a threshold of  12.0% (corresponding to a $43 stock price, above which vesting begins) and a goal of 30.2% (corresponding to a $50 stock price, at or above which 100% vesting would occur) from the $38.41 trailing 20-day  average stock price as of October 1, 2017 (the original award grant date) through March 15, 2021 (the end of the award's multi-year term). The percentage of the grant that vests for total stockholder return in between the 12.0%  threshold and 30.2% goal values is based on a linear interpolation between these two amounts. Total stockholder return is calculated using a trailing 20-day average stock price and the corresponding stock  prices cited above assume that no dividends, stock splits or other similar adjustments have occurred. A portion of the LTP Award may vest on March 15, 2020 if total stockholder return reaches the vesting range by such date, provided that  vesting is limited to 25% for the 2020 measurement date. No portion of the LTP Award would vest at any time unless Cadence's total stockholder return from February 21, 2017 through the applicable measurement date is equal to or greater  than the 35th percentile of the companies listed in the S&P MidCap 400 Information Technology Index as of February 21, 2017.

(17)   LTP Award was granted on February 21, 2017 and vests upon achieving total stockholder return between a threshold of  45.3% (corresponding to a $28 stock price, above which vesting begins) and a goal of 123.1% (corresponding to a $43 stock price, at or above which 100% vesting would occur) from the $19.27 trailing 20-day  average stock price as of February 8, 2016 through March 15, 2021 (the end of the award's multi-year term). The percentage of the grant that vests for total stockholder return in between the 45.3% threshold and 123.1% goal values is  based on a linear interpolation between these two amounts. Total stockholder return is calculated using a trailing 20-day average stock price and the corresponding stock prices cited above assume that no  dividends, stock splits or other similar adjustments have occurred. The LTP Award terms provide for the possibility of partial vesting on two interim measurement dates – March 15, 2019 and March 15, 2020 – if total stockholder return  reaches the vesting range by such dates, subject to vesting limits of 20% for the 2019 measurement date and 40% for the 2020 measurement date. No portion of the LTP Award would vest at any time unless Cadence's total stockholder return from  February 8, 2016 through the applicable measurement date is equal to or greater than the 35th percentile of the companies listed in the S&P MidCap 400 Information Technology Index as of February 8, 2016. On March 15, 2019, 20% of  the LTP Award vested.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND THE SEVERANCE PLAN 
The information below describes certain compensation that would have become payable to the NEOs under existing plans and contractual arrangements, assuming that a termination of employment or a change in control combined with a termination of employment had occurred on December 29, 2018, based upon the $43.34 per share closing price of Cadence common stock on December 28, 2018 (the last business day of Cadence's fiscal 2018), given the compensation and service levels of each NEO. In addition to the benefits described below, upon any termination of employment, the NEOs who elect to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan would also be entitled to the amount shown in the "Aggregate Balance at Last FYE" column of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table above. 
As of December 29, 2018, Messrs. Devgan and Tan were each subject to an employment agreement with Cadence, while Messrs. Mandava, Wall and Zaman were participants in the Severance Plan, which was adopted by the Compensation Committee in May 2016. The employment agreements Cadence previously entered into with certain of its executive officers, including Messrs. Devgan and Tan, contain severance provisions that remain in effect, and such executive officers do not participate in the Severance Plan. 
The employment agreements and the Severance Plan generally provide for the payment of benefits if the executive's employment with Cadence is terminated by Cadence without "cause" (as defined below), upon a termination of employment due to death or "permanent disability" (as defined below), and upon a termination of employment either by Cadence without "cause" or by the executive in connection with a "constructive termination" (as defined below) that occurs during the period commencing three months before a "change in control" (as defined below) of Cadence and ending thirteen months following such "change in control." In addition, the employment agreements generally provide for the payment of benefits if the executive's employment with Cadence is terminated by the executive in connection with a "constructive termination." The Severance Plan, however, does not provide for the payment of benefits if the executive's employment with Cadence is terminated by the executive in connection with a "constructive termination" unless the "constructive termination" commences within three months prior to a "change in control" of Cadence and ending thirteen months following such "change in control." The employment agreements and the Severance Plan do not provide for any benefits upon a termination by Cadence for "cause" or upon a voluntary resignation by the executive. 
For purposes of the employment agreements and the Severance Plan, "cause," "constructive termination," "change in control" and "permanent disability" are defined as follows: 
"Cause" generally means an executive's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• gross misconduct or fraud in the performance of duties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conviction or guilty plea or plea of nolo contendere with respect to any felony or act of moral turpitude;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• engagement in any material act of theft or material misappropriation of company property in connection with employment;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• material breach of Cadence's Bylaws or any other agreement with Cadence or its affiliates (including the Code of  Business Conduct and proprietary information and inventions agreement); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• material failure or refusal to perform the assigned duties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]               71 
[END TABLE]
"Constructive termination" generally means the occurrence of any one of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Mr. Tan – a material adverse change, without his written consent, in his authority, duties, title or reporting  relationship causing his position to be of materially less stature or responsibility, including removal from his current position, or a reduction, without his written consent, in his base salary then in effect by more than 5% or a reduction by more  than 5% in the stated target bonus opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Devgan, Mandava, Wall and Zaman – Cadence's removal of the executive from his current position;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Devgan, Mandava, Wall and Zaman – a reduction, without written consent, in base salary by more than 10% or  a reduction by more than 10% in the stated target bonus opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Devgan and Tan – in the event the executive, prior to a "change in control," is identified as an  executive officer of Cadence for purposes of the rules promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and following a "change in control" in which Cadence or any successor remains a publicly traded entity, the executive is not  identified as an executive officer for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act at any time within one year after the "change in control";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Devgan and Tan – any material breach by Cadence of any provision of the employment agreement;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a relocation of the executive's principal place of employment by more than 30 miles, unless the executive consents in  writing to such relocation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any failure by Cadence to obtain the written assumption of the employment agreement or the Severance Plan by any successor  to Cadence.  
[END TABLE]
"Change in control" generally means the occurrence of any one of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any person is or becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power represented by Cadence's then  outstanding voting securities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any person acquires (or has acquired during the twelve-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by  such person) more than 30% of the total voting power represented by Cadence's then outstanding voting securities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if a majority of the members of the Board are replaced in any two-year period other  than in specific circumstances;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of a merger or consolidation of Cadence with any other corporation if such merger or consolidation is  approved by the stockholders of Cadence, other than a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Cadence's outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such merger or consolidation receive securities possessing at least 80% of the  total voting power represented by the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity immediately after such merger or consolidation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of the liquidation, sale or disposition by Cadence of all or substantially all of Cadence's assets if  such liquidation, sale or disposition is approved by the stockholders of Cadence.  
[END TABLE]
"Permanent disability" generally means any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can reasonably be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can reasonably be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months and that renders the executive unable to perform effectively all of the essential functions of the position pursuant to the employment agreement or the Severance Plan, with or without reasonable accommodation. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 72               
[END TABLE]
If the executive's employment is terminated by Cadence without "cause" (and not due to death or "permanent disability") under the applicable employment agreement or Severance Plan, or if the executive terminates employment in connection with a "constructive termination" under the applicable employment agreement, the executive will be entitled to the benefits provided for in a transition agreement provided for in the applicable employment agreement or Severance Plan in exchange for the executive's execution and delivery of a general release of claims in favor of Cadence. The transition agreements provide for a transition period commencing on the date that the executive no longer holds his or her executive position and ending on the earliest of (i) the date on which the executive resigns as an employee of Cadence, (ii) the date on which Cadence terminates the executive's employment due to a material breach by the executive of his or her duties or obligations under the transition agreement, and (iii) one year from the transition commencement date. During such transition period Cadence would provide the following payments and benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued employment by Cadence as a non-executive employee for up to a one-year transition period at a monthly salary of $4,000 per month, payable for up to six months commencing on the first pay date that is more than 30 days following the date that is six months following the  commencement of the transition period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provided the executive elects COBRA coverage, continued coverage during the one-year  transition period under Cadence's medical, dental and vision insurance plans, at Cadence's expense;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting, as of the commencement of the transition period, of the executive's outstanding and unvested  equity compensation awards, other than awards with performance-based vesting criteria, that would have vested over the succeeding twelve-month period (or, in the case of Mr. Tan, the succeeding 18-month  period); provided that, if the executive remains employed pursuant to the transition agreement through the end of the applicable performance period, unvested equity compensation awards that are subject to performance-based vesting criteria and that  are outstanding as of the commencement of the transition period will continue to vest through the end of the applicable performance period only to the extent such performance period ends within twelve months (or, in the case of Mr. Tan,  18 months) after the commencement of the transition period, the applicable performance conditions are satisfied and the executive remains employed pursuant to the transition agreement through the end of the applicable performance period;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum payment equal to one year's base salary at the highest annualized  rate in effect during the executive's employment, payable on the 30th day following the date that is six months after the commencement of the transition period (the "First Transition Payment Date"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum payment equal to a percentage of the executive's annual base salary  at the highest rate in effect during the executive's employment (125% for Mr. Tan, 100% for Messrs. Devgan, Mandava and Zaman and 75% for Mr. Wall), payable 30 to 60 days following the end of the transition period (the "Second  Transition Payment Date"), provided the executive does not resign from employment with Cadence and Cadence does not terminate the executive's employment due to a material breach of the executive's duties under the transition  agreement.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the employment agreements and the Severance Plan provide that if, within three months before or thirteen months after a "change in control," an executive's employment is terminated without "cause" or the executive terminates employment in connection with a "constructive termination," then, in exchange for the executive's execution and delivery of a transition and release agreement, in lieu of the equity acceleration described above, 100% of the executive's outstanding and unvested equity compensation awards will immediately vest in full (unless specifically provided to the contrary in the equity grant agreements). All other provisions of the transition agreement described in the paragraph above remain unchanged, except that the executives will also receive: (i) a lump-sum payment equal to 50% of the executive's annual base salary at the highest rate in effect during the executive's employment on the First Transition Payment Date, and (ii) a lump-sum payment equal to a percentage of the executive's annual base salary at the highest rate in effect during the executive's employment (62.5% for Mr. Tan, 50% for Messrs. Devgan, Mandava and Zaman and 37.5% for Mr. Wall) on the Second 
[BEGIN TABLE]               73 
[END TABLE]
 Transition Payment Date. The executives are not entitled to a tax gross-up in connection with any "excess parachute payments" paid upon a "change in control," but instead are entitled to the best after-tax alternative. 
Under the employment agreements and the Severance Plan, if the executive's employment is terminated due to the executive's death or "permanent disability," the executive will be entitled to the following payments and benefits if the executive's estate executes and delivers a release agreement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting, as of the date of the executive's termination of employment, of outstanding unvested equity  compensation awards that would have vested over the succeeding twelve-month period, and such awards and all previously vested equity awards will remain exercisable for 24 months from the date of the executive's termination of employment  (but not later than the expiration of the term of the applicable award); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• solely in the case of termination due to "permanent disability," and provided the executive elects COBRA coverage,  continued coverage for twelve months under Cadence's medical, dental and vision insurance plans, at Cadence's expense.  
[END TABLE]
The receipt of benefits following termination of employment under the employment agreements and the Severance Plan is contingent upon the affected executive delivering and not revoking a general release in favor of Cadence. In addition, the post-termination benefits provided for under these employment agreements and the Severance Plan, except upon death or "permanent disability," are contingent upon the affected executive complying with the terms of the transition agreements. During the transition period, the executive is entitled to receive the payments described above, is prohibited from competing with Cadence, soliciting employees of Cadence or interfering with Cadence's relationships with its current or prospective clients, customers, joint-venture partners or financial backers, and must provide Cadence with continued cooperation in matters related to the executive's employment. Any violation of the provisions of the transition agreement would result in the cessation of Cadence's obligation to provide the then-unpaid portion of the affected executive's termination benefits. 
LIFE INSURANCE 
In addition to the benefits described above and quantified below, Cadence provides each of its benefits-eligible U.S.-based employees, including each of its executive officers, with life insurance in an amount equal to the lesser of two times the employee's annual target cash compensation (base salary plus target bonus) or $2,000,000, which, as of December 29, 2018, for Messrs. Tan, Devgan, Mandava, Wall and Zaman was $2,000,000, $2,000,000, $1,500,000, $1,312,500 and $1,600,000, respectively. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS 
The tables below set forth the estimated value of the potential payments to the NEOs, assuming the executive's employment had terminated on December 29, 2018, based upon the $43.34 per share closing price of Cadence common stock on December 28, 2018 (the last business day of Cadence's fiscal 2018), under the applicable employment agreement or Severance Plan in effect at that time, and, for purposes of the second table below, that a change in control of Cadence had also occurred on that date. Amounts are reported without any reduction for possible delay in the commencement or timing of payments or due to any reduction under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, Cadence is providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of its employees to the annual total compensation of Mr. Tan, Cadence's CEO. To understand this disclosure, Cadence believes that it is important to give context to Cadence's operations. Cadence's corporate headquarters is in San Jose, California and Cadence has employees in over 20 countries. As a global organization, approximately 63% of Cadence's employees were located outside of the U.S. as of December 29, 2018. 
As discussed above in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," Cadence is engaged in a very competitive industry, and its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified, talented and creative employees. Consistent with Cadence's executive compensation program, Cadence's global compensation program is designed to be competitive in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which an employee is located. Accordingly, Cadence's pay structures vary among its employees based on position and geographic location, with significant consideration given to competitive market practices. 
RATIO 
For 2018, Cadence's last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all of Cadence's employees, other than Mr. Tan, was $112,583.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Tan's annual total compensation, as reported in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation  Table presented above under "Compensation of Executive Officers," was $7,556,368.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Tan to the median of the annual total compensation of all of Cadence's employees other than Mr. Tan is estimated to be 67 to 1. 
IDENTIFICATION OF MEDIAN EMPLOYEE 
Cadence selected December 29, 2018, the last day of fiscal 2018, as the date on which to determine its median employee. As of that date, Cadence had approximately 7,720 employees, including full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees and interns. For purposes of identifying the median employee, Cadence considered the aggregate of all the following compensation elements for each of its employees, as compiled from Cadence's internal records as of December 29, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target base salary or base pay  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target bonuses  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Grant date fair value of equity awards granted in fiscal 2018  
[END TABLE]
Cadence selected the above compensation elements because they represent Cadence's principal broad-based compensation elements. For purposes of identifying the median employee, any compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on the average of the exchange rates for each of the twelve periods in Cadence's fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. In identifying its median employee, Cadence did not make any cost-of-living adjustments or exclude any foreign jurisdictions in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
[BEGIN TABLE]               79 
[END TABLE]
In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, such employee's compensation was calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, as required pursuant to the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of Cadence's NEOs. 
[BEGIN TABLE] 80               
[END TABLE]
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS 
REVIEW, APPROVAL OR RATIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
The Board has adopted written Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures, which require that all "interested transactions" with "related parties" (each as defined below) be subject to approval or ratification in accordance with the procedures outlined in the policy. 
An "interested transaction" is any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 since the beginning of Cadence's last  completed fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cadence or any of its subsidiaries is a participant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any "related party" has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a  director or, together with all other related parties, less than 10%, in the aggregate, beneficial owner of another entity).  
[END TABLE]
A "related party" covered by the policy is any: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Person who was or is (since the beginning of the last fiscal year) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as  a director of Cadence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Greater than 5% beneficial owner of Cadence common stock; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Immediate family member of any of those parties, which includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children,  stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law,  brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home (other than tenants or employees).  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the material facts of all interested transactions and either approves or disapproves of the entry into the transaction. If advanced approval of an interested transaction is not feasible, the transaction is reviewed and, if the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at that committee's next scheduled meeting. In determining whether to approve or ratify an interested transaction, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee takes into account, among other appropriate factors, the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction and whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to unaffiliated third parties under similar circumstances. Directors may not participate in any discussion or approval of an interested transaction for which they are a related party. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has preapproved or ratified the following categories of potential interested transactions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any employment by Cadence of an executive officer of Cadence if:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The related compensation is required to be reported in Cadences proxy statement under the SECs compensation  disclosure requirements, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ◾    The executive officer is not an immediate family member of a related party, the related compensation would be  reported in Cadences proxy statement under the SECs compensation disclosure requirements if the executive officer was a NEO and the Compensation Committee approved (or recommended that the Board approve) such compensation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]               81 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any compensation paid to a director if the compensation is required to be reported in Cadence's proxy statement under  the SEC's compensation disclosure requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any transaction with another company in which the related person's only relationship is as a non-executive employee, director and/or equity owner of, together with all other related parties, less than 10% of that company's shares, if the aggregate amount involved, since the beginning of Cadence's  last completed fiscal year, exceeds $100,000 but does not exceed the greater of (i) $200,000 and/or (ii) 5% of the recipient's total annual revenues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any charitable contribution by Cadence to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related  person's only relationship is as a non-executive employee or director, if the aggregate amount involved, since the beginning of Cadence's last completed fiscal year, exceeds $100,000 but does not  exceed the lesser of (i) $200,000 or (ii) 5% of the charitable organization's total annual revenues, or if donations are made pursuant to Cadence's matching program as a result of contributions by employees, pursuant to a program  that is available on the same terms to all employees of Cadence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any transaction where the related person's interest arises solely from the ownership of Cadence common stock and all  holders of Cadence common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any transaction with a related party involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee  under a trust indenture or similar services.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has also delegated to the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify any interested transaction with a related party in which the aggregate amount is expected to be less than $1,000,000. Further, if a director serves as an executive officer of another company with which Cadence does business, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may establish guidelines, via resolutions, under which certain transactions are deemed pre-approved and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, on at least an annual basis, reviews both Cadence's relationship with the director-affiliated company and the guidelines that have been established for management of that relationship. 
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
As disclosed previously and in this proxy statement, Mr. Tan, Cadence's CEO and a member of the Board, is also the founder and Chairman of Walden International ("Walden"), an international venture capital firm, that invests in privately held companies. In addition to continuing to serve as Chairman of Walden, from time to time Mr. Tan also makes direct investments alongside Walden or in other companies in the semiconductor and electronics systems industry for himself or his family. Certain companies that are customers of Cadence have, from time to time, invested in Walden funds. As of December 29, 2018, the aggregate amount of such investments by such customers represented approximately 14.7% of Walden's total cumulative capital commitments. 
From time to time, companies in which Walden or Mr. Tan has invested are customers of Cadence or otherwise transact with Cadence. In fiscal 2018, customer arrangements involving companies associated with Walden, Mr. Tan or his family accounted for less than 4% of Cadence's consolidated gross revenue. All of these arrangements were entered into in the best interests of Cadence and none of these arrangements individually was material to Cadence. 
While none of the foregoing transactions, individually or in the aggregate, is material to Cadence or Mr. Tan, the Board has nonetheless put in place policies and procedures designed to assure that any such transactions are appropriately reviewed and monitored by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and that any such transactions that are entered into are on an arm's length basis and on terms that are not adverse to Cadence. Such transactions will be undertaken by Cadence only when the transactions are in the best interests of Cadence and when Mr. Tan's interest is appropriately disclosed and the transaction is approved by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (e.g., on the basis that it will be made on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and considering the 
[BEGIN TABLE] 82               
[END TABLE]
 extent of Mr. Tan's interest in the transaction). In addition, all such transactions, including discussions prior to the execution of the agreements, are subject to the terms of the Code of Business Conduct and Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures.    These policies and internal procedural guidelines also require that Mr. Tan recuse himself from any discussion or approval by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Cadence's transactions with those companies that are associated with Walden or Mr. Tan, except to provide material information concerning such transactions to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Further, when required by SEC rules and regulations, Cadence will disclose the terms of individual transactions to its stockholders. 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS 
Cadence's Bylaws provide that Cadence will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Cadence's Bylaws also authorize the Board to cause Cadence to enter into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers and employees and to purchase insurance on behalf of any person it is permitted to indemnify. Pursuant to these Bylaw provisions, Cadence has entered into indemnity agreements with each of its directors and executive officers, and has also purchased insurance on behalf of its directors and executive officers. 
Each indemnity agreement provides, among other things, that Cadence will indemnify each signatory to the extent provided in the agreement for expenses, witness fees, damages, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and any other amounts that the individual becomes legally obligated to pay because of any claim or claims made against or by him or her in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, arbitral, administrative or investigative, to which the individual is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer, employee or other agent of Cadence, and otherwise as may be provided to the individual by Cadence under the non-exclusivity provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and Cadence's Bylaws.

4.  Administration of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Procedure. The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may appoint a Committee  consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors, to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. In such event, any references in the Plan to the  Board of Directors shall be deemed to refer to the Committee. To the extent required to satisfy the requirements of Rule 16b-3, the Committee shall consist of two or more  "Non-Employee Directors" (as defined under Rule 16b-3). Once appointed, the Committee shall continue to serve until otherwise directed by the Board of  Directors. Unless and until otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall be the "Committee" hereunder. From time to time the Board of Directors may increase or decrease the size  of the Committee and appoint additional members thereof, remove members (with or without cause), and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill vacancies however caused and remove all members of the Committee, and thereafter directly  administer the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4 to the contrary, at any time the Board of Directors or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board of Directors the authority to grant Awards to  all Employees and Consultants or any portion or class thereof, to the extent consistent with applicable law or regulations. In addition, the Board of Directors or the Committee may by resolution authorize one or more officers of the Company to  perform any or all tasks that the Board is authorized and empowered to do or perform under the Plan, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and for all purposes under the Plan, such officer or officers shall be treated as the Board; provided,  however, that the resolution so authorizing such officer or officers shall specify the maximum number of Shares per Award (if any) and the total number of Shares (if any) such officer or officers may award pursuant to such delegated authority, and  any such Award shall be subject to the form of Award Agreement theretofore approved by the Board of Directors or the Committee. No such officer shall designate himself or herself, or designate any executive officer (that is, an officer within the  meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) or member of the Board of Directors, as a recipient of any Awards granted under authority delegated to such officer.  
[END TABLE]

To the extent that the grant of an Option exceeds this limit, the portion of the Option that exceeds such limit shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 
The Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuation of employment or consultancy by the Company or any Affiliate, as applicable, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Participant's right or the Company's or any Affiliate's right, as applicable, to terminate the Participant's employment at any time or the Participant's consultancy pursuant to the terms of the Consultant's agreement with the Company or any Affiliate.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, immediately before the  grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair  Market Value per Share on the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(a), an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or Nonstatutory  Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price lower than set forth in this Section 8(a) if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of  the Code.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  Consideration. Subject to applicable law, the consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of  an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board and may consist entirely of cash, check, shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as  to which said Option shall be exercised, or any combination of such methods of payment, or such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares as may be determined by the Board. In making its determination as to the type of  consideration to accept, the Board shall consider if acceptance of such consideration may be reasonably expected to benefit the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  No Repricing without Stockholder Approval. Other than in connection with a change in the Company's  capitalization (as described in Section 12), the Company shall not, without stockholder approval, (i) reduce the exercise price of any Option, (ii) exchange any Option for cash, another Award or a new Option with a lower exercise  price, or (iii) otherwise directly or indirectly reprice any Option.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times  and under such conditions as determined by the Board, including Performance Criteria with respect to the Company and/or the Participant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. 
An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(b) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan. 
Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares that thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.

To the extent that the  Participant was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or if the Participant does not exercise such Option (which the Participant was entitled to exercise) within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  Extension of Termination Date. A Participant's Award Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the  Option following the termination of the Participant's Continuous Service as an Employee or Consultant (other than upon the Participant's death or disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of Shares would  violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, then the Option shall terminate three (3) months after the first date when the issuance of such Shares would not violate such registration requirements under the Securities Act.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  Death of Participant. In the event of the death of a Participant during the term of the Option who is at the time  of the Participant's death an Employee or Consultant and who shall have been in Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant since the date of grant of the Option, the Option may be exercised at any time within the period of time ending on  the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months (or such other period of time as is determined by the Board) following the date of death or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option, by the Participant's estate or by a person who  acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise it at the date of such termination.

Incentive Stock is an award or issuance of shares of Common Stock under the Plan, the grant, issuance,  retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject during specified periods of time to such conditions (including continued service or performance conditions) and terms as the Board deems appropriate. Restricted Stock Units are awards  denominated in units of Shares under which the issuance of Shares is subject to such conditions (including continued employment or Performance Criteria) and terms as the Board deems appropriate. Unless determined otherwise by the Board, each  Restricted Stock Unit will be equal to one Share and will entitle a Participant to either the issuance of Shares or, if specified in an Award Agreement, payment of an amount of cash determined with reference to the value of Shares. The grant,  vesting or retention of an Incentive Stock and/or Restricted Stock Unit Award may be based on one or more Performance Criteria selected by the Board, or any other criteria deemed appropriate by the Board.

              A-7 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  Award Agreements. Each Award Agreement related to Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall contain  provisions regarding (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such award or a formula for determining such number, (ii) the purchase price of the Shares, if any, and the means of payment for the Shares, (iii) the  Performance Criteria, if any, and level of achievement of these criteria that shall determine the number of Shares granted, issued, retainable and/or vested, (iv) such terms and conditions on the grant, issuance, vesting and/or forfeiture of  the Shares as may be determined from time to time by the Board, (v) restrictions on the transferability of the Shares, and (vi) such further terms and conditions in each case not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined from time to  time by the Board. Shares of Incentive Stock may be issued in the name of the Participant and held by the Participant or held by the Company, in each case as the Board may provide.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  Sales Price. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board shall determine the price, if any, at which  shares of Incentive Stock or Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units shall be sold or awarded to a Participant, which price may vary from time to time and among Participants and which may be above or below the Fair Market Value of such shares at  the date of grant or issuance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  Share Vesting. The grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of shares of Incentive Stock and Restricted Stock  Units, as applicable, shall be at such time and in such installments as determined by the Board. The Board shall have the right to make the timing of the grant and/or the issuance, ability to retain and/or vesting of shares of Incentive Stock and  Restricted Stock Units subject to continued service, passage of time and/or such Performance Criteria as deemed appropriate by the Board; provided that, in no event shall an award of Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted to an executive  officer (that is, an officer within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) vest sooner than (i) three (3) years after the date of grant, if the vesting of the Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units is based solely on  Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant and the grant of Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units is not a form of payment of earned incentive compensation or other performance-based compensation, provided, however, that notwithstanding the  foregoing vesting limitations, shares of Incentive Stock and awards of Restricted Stock Units vesting under this clause (i) may vest in installments so long as the vesting schedule, at any point in time, is not more favorable than what would be  vested under a monthly pro rata installment schedule (i.e., 1/36 per month for 3 years), or one (1) year after the date of grant, if the vesting of Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units is subject to the achievement of  Performance Criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may accelerate vesting (in an Award Agreement or otherwise) of any Award in the event of a Participant's termination of service as an Employee or Consultant, a Change in Control or  other similar event.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (e)  Transferability. Shares of Incentive Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be transferable by the Participant only  upon such terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, as the Board shall determine in its discretion, so long as the Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, awarded under the Award Agreement remain  subject to the terms of the Award Agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (f)  Discretionary Adjustments. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of shares granted,  issued, retainable and/or vested under an award of Incentive Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations may be reduced by the Board on the basis of such further  considerations as the Board shall determine. In addition, the Board may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under any Performance Criteria to exclude any of the following events that occurs during a performance period: (i) asset  write-downs, (ii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (iii) the effect of changes in tax law, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, (iv) accruals for reorganization and  restructuring programs, and (v) any unusual or infrequently occurring items as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results  of operations appearing in the Company's annual report to stockholders for the applicable year.

Unless otherwise determined by the Board, Participants holding shares of Incentive Stock granted  hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares during the period of restriction. With respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units, Participants shall have no voting rights unless and until such Shares are reflected as  issued and outstanding shares on the Company's stock ledger.

  (h)  Dividends and Distributions. Participants in whose name an Award of Incentive Stock is granted shall be entitled to  receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the Shares underlying such Award, unless determined otherwise by the Board. Participants in whose name an Award of Restricted Stock Units is granted shall not be entitled to receive  dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the Shares underlying such Award, unless determined otherwise by the Board. The Board will determine whether any such dividends or distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional  Shares or will be payable in cash; provided that such additional Shares and/or cash shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting conditions as the Award with respect to which they were distributed. Notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary, in no event shall dividends or dividend equivalents be currently payable with respect to unvested or unearned Awards subject to Performance Criteria.

[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  Non-Transferability of Awards. Except as otherwise expressly provided in  the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or otherwise disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the  lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant or the Participant's legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a  third party who, in the event of the death of the Participant, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Change in Control. The number of Shares covered by each outstanding  Award, and the number of Shares which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation, expiration, forfeiture or other termination of an  Award, as well as the price per Share covered by each such outstanding Award, shall be equitably adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split or the payment of a stock dividend  with respect to the Common Stock or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the  Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustments shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided  herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common  Stock subject to an Award. Such adjustment shall be designed to comply with Section 409A and 424 of the Code or, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3(d) of this Plan, may be designed to treat the Shares available under the  Plan and subject to Awards as if they were all outstanding on the record date for such event or transaction or to increase the number of such Shares to reflect a deemed reinvestment in Shares of the amount distributed to the Company's  securityholders.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the Plan, a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to occur upon the consummation of any one of the following events: (a) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (b) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (other than a transaction the principal purpose of which is to change the state of the Company's incorporation or a transaction in which the voting securities of the Company are exchanged for beneficial ownership of at least 50% of the voting securities of the controlling acquiring corporation); (c) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the surviving corporation and less than 50% of the voting securities of the Company that are outstanding immediately after the consummation of such transaction are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the persons who owned

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  Effect of Amendment or Termination.

17.  Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of the Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such  number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. The Company's inability to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary  for the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
20.  Section 409A. It is intended that any Award issued to U.S. taxpayers pursuant to this Plan  and any Award Agreement shall not constitute "deferrals of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, as a result, shall not be subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, to the extent applicable, it is further intended that any Restricted Stock Units issued to U.S. taxpayers pursuant to this Plan and any Award Agreement or other written document establishing the terms and conditions of the Award  (which may or may not constitute "deferrals of compensation," depending on the terms of each Award) shall avoid any "plan failures" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. The Plan and each Award Agreement or  other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award are to be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions. However, no guarantee or commitment is made that the Plan, any Award Agreement or any other  written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award shall be administered in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, with respect to amounts that are subject to such requirements, or that the Plan, any Award  Agreement or any other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award shall be administered in a manner that avoids the application of Section 409A of the Code, with respect to amounts that are not subject to such  requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
21.  Required Delay in Payment on Account of a Separation from Service. Notwithstanding any other provision in this  Plan, any Award agreement or any other written document establishing the terms and conditions of an Award, if any Award recipient is a "specified employee" (as defined in Treasury  Regulations Section 1.409A-1(i)), as of the date of his or her "Separation from Service" (as defined in authoritative IRS guidance under Section 409A of the Code), then, to the extent  required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(2), any payment made to the Award recipient on account of his or her Separation from Service shall not be made before a date that is six months  after the date of his or her Separation from Service. The Board may elect any of the methods of applying this rule that are permitted under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(2)(ii).
