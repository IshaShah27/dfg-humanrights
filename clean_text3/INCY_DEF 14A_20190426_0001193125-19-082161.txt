Dear Fellow Stockholders, 
This past year was one of significant progress as we seek to build Incyte into a diversified, fast-growing and global biopharmaceutical company. 
Before highlighting our achievements in 2018, an important, although disappointing, event was the result of ECHO-301, our Phase 3 trial together with Merck evaluating epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab, Merck's PD-1 antagonist, for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. The expectations internally and within the medical community were high, and we were disappointed that the combination did not show a benefit in progression-free survival (PFS) over pembrolizumab monotherapy. We continue to learn as much as we can from the results, but this event reinforced our belief in the importance of having a robust portfolio of development projects. I'd like to now move on to our 2018 achievements. 
Sales of Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) continue to grow in both approved indications, myelofibrosis (MF)1 and polycythemia vera (PV)1. The stories of the patients we treat inspire us to do better, and we are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). To that end, we are pursuing strategies that may improve patient outcomes in three ways: improved formulations of ruxolitinib, investigating ruxolitinib-based combination therapies, and discovering new targets beyond JAK inhibition. 
With the ongoing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and NDA submissions expected in the near-term for pemigatinib in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and itacitinib in treatment-naïve GVHD, we are confident in our potential to drive top-line growth in the years to come. 
Our discovery and development teams have created multiple opportunities for growth. In the coming year, we plan to focus on six key late-stage product candidates outlined below that, together, we believe may drive significant revenue growth in the near future. 
We also have two late-stage product candidates, baricitinib and capmatinib, which are out-licensed globally to Eli Lilly and Novartis, respectively. In June, we, along with Eli Lilly, announced the FDA approval of Olumiant® (baricitinib) for the treatment of certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)5. Lilly is also developing baricitinib in multiple other autoimmune disorders and recently announced that the first two Phase 3 trials of baricitinib in atopic dermatitis achieved their primary endpoints. Lilly expects the last three of the five Phase 3 trials needed to seek approval in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis to readout later in 2019. Data from capmatinib were presented in non-small cell lung cancer patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2018 Congress (ESMO), and Novartis has stated that it plans to submit an NDA in this indication this year. 
It's also important to note that should these goals come to fruition as we expect, five Incyte-invented molecules will have received FDA approval. We believe this remarkable achievement would be an excellent illustration of the quality of the work of our world class biologists and chemists. 
On the financial front, total revenues reached $1.9B in 2018, an increase of over 20% versus 2017. Iclusig® (ponatinib)6 continues to grow, and royalties from Jakavi® (ruxolitinib)7 and Olumiant® (baricitinib) are contributing more to our top-line growth with each passing year. GAAP Net Income grew to $110M for 2018 as compared to a GAAP Net Loss of $313M in 2017. 
We also had the opportunity to strengthen our executive management team with three new members in the last twelve months. First, we welcomed Maria Pasquale, J.D. as our General Counsel in April 2018. Ms. Pasquale has nearly 20 years of legal and compliance experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and most recently held the position of Global Chief Compliance Officer at Celgene Corporation. In December 2018, we were excited to welcome Dr. Dashyant Dhanak to the team as our Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Dhanak joined us from Janssen Research & Development, where he most recently served as Global Head, Discovery Sciences. In February 2019, we welcomed Christiana Stamoulis as our new Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Stamoulis has over 20 years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, 15 of which was in investment banking and management consulting, and thereafter in executive positions at Vertex Pharmaceuticals and most recently serving as the President and CFO of Unum Therapeutics. We believe the collective experience of our new leadership team members will be a great asset for Incyte as we embark on our next stage of growth. 
In October, we were proud to be recognized as the number two top employer in the biopharma industry by Science magazine. We believe that the collective experience and passion of our over 1,300 talented colleagues is foundational to our success, and as our organization continues to grow, we are committed to maintaining a culture that is driven by a passion for innovative science and where patients are at the forefront of everything we do. 
Together, we strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those with cancer and other serious diseases, and in doing so, we aim to create long-term and sustainable value for you, our stockholders. 
We thank you for your continued support and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.

Frequently Asked Questions 
Will there be any other items of business on the agenda? 
We do not expect any other items of business because the deadline for stockholder proposals and nominations has already passed. Nonetheless, in case there is an unforeseen need, the accompanying proxy gives discretionary authority to the persons named on the proxy with respect to any other matters that might be brought before the meeting. Those persons intend to vote that proxy in accordance with their best judgment. 
Who is entitled to vote? 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2019, the Record Date, may vote at the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date. 
How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock on the Record Date constitutes a quorum, which is required to hold and conduct business at the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 214,264,527 shares of our common stock outstanding. If you are a record holder and you submit your proxy, regardless of whether you abstain from voting on one or more matters, your shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. If your shares are held in street name, your shares are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum if your broker, bank or other nominee submits a proxy covering your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee is entitled to submit a proxy covering your shares as to certain "routine" matters, even if you have not instructed your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote on those matters. Please see "How are votes counted?" below. If a quorum is not present, we expect that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until we obtain a quorum. 
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
Stockholder of Record.    If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the "stockholder of record." This Proxy Statement, our Annual Report and the proxy card have been sent directly to you by Incyte. 
Beneficial Owner.    If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. This Proxy Statement and our Annual Report have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee. 
How do I vote? 
You may vote using any of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 By Mail              By Telephone            By Internet              In Person at the Annual Meeting

[END TABLE]
You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. If you submitted your proxy by mail, you must file with the Secretary of our Company a written notice of revocation or deliver, prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting, a valid, later dated proxy. If you submitted your proxy by telephone or the internet, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy with a later telephone or internet proxy, as the case may be. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless you give written notice of revocation to the Secretary before the proxy is exercised or you vote by written ballot at the Annual Meeting. For shares you hold beneficially in street name, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy by submitting new voting instructions to or informing your broker, bank or other nominee in accordance that entity's procedures for changing or revoking your voting instructions. 
How are votes counted? 
In the election of directors, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" for each nominee. For each of Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." 
If you provide specific instructions, your shares will be voted as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card or voting instruction form with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board ("FOR" all of the nominees to the Board of Directors, "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, "FOR" the approval of the amendments to our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, "FOR" the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm, "AGAINST" the stockholder proposal, if properly presented, and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matters that may properly come before the meeting). 
If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker, bank or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker, bank or other nominee is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not vote your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee can vote your shares at its discretion only on Proposal 4, the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Annual Meeting, other than Proposal 4, assuming that a quorum is obtained. 
What vote is required to approve each item? 
We have a majority voting standard for the election of directors in an uncontested election, which is generally defined as an election in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Cumulative voting is not permitted, which means that each stockholder may vote no more than the number of shares he or she owns for a single director candidate. Under our majority voting standard, in uncontested elections of directors, such as this election, each director must be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy. A "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the nominee. If a director nominee is an incumbent director and does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, that director will continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover" director, but will be subject to our director resignation policy. Additional information concerning our director resignation policy is set forth under the heading "Corporate Governance—Majority Voting Policy."

What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
We have adopted a process for mailing our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement called "householding," which has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Householding means that stockholders who share the same last name and address will receive only one copy of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement, unless we receive contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. We will continue to mail a proxy card to each stockholder of record. 
If you prefer to receive multiple copies of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement at the same address, additional copies will be provided to you upon request. If you are a stockholder of record, you may contact us by writing to Investor Relations Department, Incyte Corporation, 1801 Augustine Cut-Off, Wilmington, Delaware 19803 or by calling (302) 498-6700 and asking for Investor Relations. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. We have undertaken householding to reduce printing costs and postage fees, and we encourage you to participate. 
If you are a beneficial owner, you may request additional copies of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement or you may request householding by notifying your broker, bank or other nominee. 
How are proxies solicited? 
Our employees, officers and directors may solicit proxies. We will pay the cost of printing and mailing proxy materials, and will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation material to the owners of our common stock. In addition, we have engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist us in soliciting proxies for a fee of $12,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses. 
Stockholder Engagement 
Throughout the year, we maintain an ongoing stockholder outreach program to garner feedback as well as to answer any questions stockholders may have both during and outside of proxy season. Our goal is to ensure that our corporate governance practices, our compensation program and our stockholder communications align with best practices. 
Each year, we proactively reach out to our stockholders to determine how our corporate governance, compensation practices and stockholder communications might improve. In 2018 and 2017, we contacted stockholders representing over 80% and 60% of our shares outstanding, respectively. Our CEO, our Lead Independent Director and the rest of our Board – along with the rest of our executive management – regularly discuss the learnings from these thorough and informative conversations. As a result of this ongoing stockholder engagement over the last four years, we have implemented several significant enhancements in our corporate governance and compensation policies and in our stockholder communication practices, including most recently in 2019. We believe these changes help us to further align the Company's interests with the best interests of our stockholders.

Majority Voting Policy 
Our Bylaws include a majority voting standard for the election of directors. In order to receive a majority of the votes cast, the number of shares voted "FOR" must exceed the number of votes "AGAINST"; abstentions and broker non-votes do not count as votes cast. Our Bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election, director nominees must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected to the Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that if a nominee for director in an uncontested election does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the director should submit a resignation for consideration by the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate and make a recommendation to the Board with respect to the proffered resignation. The Board must take action on the recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. The director whose resignation is under consideration cannot participate in any decision regarding his or her resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
Our current leadership structure and governing documents permit the roles of Chairman and CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals. Where the Chairman and CEO roles are filled by the same individual, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the independent directors on our Board to appoint a Lead Independent Director. The Board has currently determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to have Hervé Hoppenot, our President and CEO, serve as Chairman, coupled with an active Lead Independent Director. As such, Mr. Hoppenot holds the position of Chairman, President and CEO, and Julian C. Baker serves as our Lead Independent Director. Mr. Baker is a managing member of the general partner of our largest stockholder—namely, Baker Bros. Advisors LP and affiliated entities—who collectively holds 16.1% of our common stock as of March 12, 2019. The Board retains the authority to modify this structure as it deems appropriate. 
Focus on Independence.    The Board maintains a strong commitment to ensuring Board independence so that it is able to maintain effective oversight of management. The Board's commitment to independence includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Annual appointment of a strong Lead Independent Director, who also represents our largest stockholder, thereby ensuring  strong representation of stockholder interests  
[END TABLE]

  ✓  Robust duties of the Lead Independent Director:

Benefits of Combined Leadership Structure.    The Board believes that the Company and our stockholders have been best served by having Mr. Hoppenot in the role of Chairman and CEO for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hoppenot is most familiar with our business and the unique challenges we face. As such, Mr. Hoppenot is the  director best suited to identify strategic opportunities and focus the activities of the Board. Mr. Hoppenot's day-to-day insight into our challenges  facilitates a timely deliberation by the Board of important matters.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hoppenot has and will continue to identify agenda items and lead effective discussions on the important matters  affecting us. Mr. Hoppenot's knowledge and extensive experience regarding our operations and the highly-regulated industries and markets in which we compete position him to identify and prioritize  matters for Board review and deliberation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As Chairman and CEO, Mr. Hoppenot serves as an important bridge between the Board and management and provides critical  leadership for carrying out our strategic initiatives and confronting our challenges. The Board believes that Mr. Hoppenot brings a unique, stockholder-focused insight to assist the Company to most  effectively execute its strategy and business plans to maximize stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The strength and effectiveness of the communications between Mr. Hoppenot as our Chairman and Mr. Baker as our  Lead Independent Director result in effective Board oversight of the issues, plans and prospects of our Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• This leadership structure provides the Board with more complete and timely information about the Company, a unified  structure and consistent leadership direction internally and externally and provides a collaborative and collegial environment for Board decision-making.  
[END TABLE]
Flexibility of the Leadership Structure.    The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Board values its flexibility to select, from time to time, a leadership structure that is most able to serve the Company's and stockholders' best interests based on the qualifications of individuals available and circumstances existing at the time. As such, the Board periodically evaluates whether combining or separating the roles of Chairman and CEO is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Board believes that a policy limiting its flexibility to choose, consistent with its fiduciary duties, a leadership structure that will enable the Company to most effectively execute its strategy and business plans to maximize stockholder value would be detrimental to the Company and our stockholders. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight.    Our Board is responsible for overseeing the overall risk management process at the Company directly and through its committees. The responsibility for managing risk rests with executive management while the committees of the Board and the Board as a whole participate in the oversight process. The Board's risk oversight process builds upon management's risk assessment and mitigation processes, which include reviews of long term strategic and operational planning, executive development and evaluation, regulatory and legal compliance, and financial reporting and internal controls. The Board considers strategic and operational risks and opportunities and regularly receives reports from executive management regarding specific aspects of risk management. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports from executive management with respect to, and reviews such risks associated with, our financial and accounting systems, accounting policies, investment strategies, regulatory compliance and our information systems and technology, including cybersecurity risks and readiness. The Audit Committee also meets regularly with our Chief Compliance Officer, our internal controls team and our independent registered public accounting firm in executive session without the presence of other members of management. The Compensation Committee evaluates our compensation policies and practices to help ensure that these policies and practices do not incentivize employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company and provide appropriate incentives for meeting both short-term and long-term objectives and increasing stockholder value over time. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews our risks associated with governance matters and non-compensation related human resources matters. 
Director Independence 
In 2018, our Board determined that each individual who served as a member of the Board in 2018, except for Mr. Hoppenot, was an "independent director" within the meaning of Rule 5605 of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Mr. Hoppenot is not considered independent as he is currently employed as our CEO. For Mr. Bienaimé, Mr. Baker, Mr. Brooke, Mr. Clancy, Dr. Dixon, Dr. Fouse and Dr. Friedman, the Board considered their relationship and transactions with our Company as directors and security holders of our Company. 
All of the nominees are current members of the Board. 
Director Nominations 
The Board nominates directors for election at each annual meeting of stockholders and elects new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. The Board has as an objective, set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, that its membership be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the responsibility to identify, evaluate, recruit and recommend qualified candidates to the Board for nomination or election. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will select candidates for director based on their character, judgment, diversity of experience, business acumen, and ability to act on behalf of all stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that nominees for director should have experience, such as experience in management, accounting, finance, drug discovery and development, or marketing, or industry and technology knowledge, that may be useful to the Company and the Board; high personal and professional ethics and the willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties as a director. Although the Company has no formal diversity policy for board members, the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consider diversity of backgrounds and experiences and other forms of diversity when selecting nominees. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes it appropriate for at least one, and, preferably, multiple, members of the Board to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of the members of the Board meet the definition of "independent director" under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes it appropriate for certain key members of our management — currently, our CEO — to participate as members of the Board. 
Prior to each annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees first by evaluating the current directors whose term will expire at the annual meeting and who are willing to continue in service. These candidates are evaluated based on the criteria described above, including as demonstrated by the candidate's prior service as a director, and the needs of the Board with respect to the particular talents and experience of its directors. In the event that a director does not wish to continue in service, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines not to re-nominate the director, or if a vacancy is created on the Board as a result of a resignation, an increase in the size of the Board or other event, then the Committee will consider various candidates for Board membership, including those suggested by the Committee members, by other Board members, by any search firm engaged by the Committee and by stockholders. The Committee may only recommend, and the Board may only nominate, candidates for director who agree to tender, promptly following their election or re-election as a director, irrevocable resignations that would be effective if the director fails to receive a sufficient number of votes for re-election at the next annual meeting of stockholders at which he or she faces re-election and if the Board accepts the resignation. The Committee recommended all of the nominees for election included in this Proxy Statement. All of the nominees are current members of the Board. 
A stockholder who wishes to suggest a prospective nominee for the Board should notify the Secretary of the Company or any member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in writing with any supporting material the stockholder considers appropriate. In addition, our Bylaws contain provisions that address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board at our annual meeting of stockholders. In order to nominate a candidate for director, a stockholder must give timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company and otherwise comply with the provisions of our Bylaws. To be timely, our Bylaws provide that our Secretary must have received the stockholder's notice not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that no annual meeting was held in the preceding year or the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received by the Secretary of the Company not later than the close of business on the later of (1) the 90th day prior to the date of the meeting and (2) the 10th day following the first public announcement or disclosure of the meeting date. Information required by the Bylaws to be in the notice include the name and contact information for the candidate and the person making the nomination and other information about the nominee that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations under Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules and regulations under that Section. 
Stockholder nominations must be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in, and include the information required by, our Bylaws and must be addressed to: 
Secretary 
Incyte Corporation 
1801 Augustine Cut-Off 
Wilmington, DE 19803 
You can obtain a copy of the full text of the Bylaw provision by writing to the Company's Secretary at the above address. 
Board Meetings 
The Board held five meetings during 2018. All directors attended all meetings held by the Board and of the committees on which such director served during his or her tenure in 2018. 
The independent directors meet in executive sessions at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board without the participation of our CEO or other members of management. There were four regularly scheduled meetings of the Board in 2018. 
In 2018, we did not, and for 2019, we do not, have a policy that requires the attendance of directors at the Annual Meeting. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board is committed to sound and effective corporate governance practices. Accordingly, the Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are intended to describe the governance principles and procedures by which the Board functions. The guidelines are subject to periodic review and update by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board, and were most recently amended in November 2017. These Guidelines can be found on our website at http://www.incyte.com under the "Corporate Governance" heading in the "For Investors" portion of our website. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, among other things, that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of the directors must be independent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if the Chairman of the Board is not an independent director, the independent directors will appoint a Lead Independent  Director, whose duties would include presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors, serving as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors,  approving information sent to the board, approving meeting agendas for the Board, approving meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient discussion time for all agenda items, and being available for consultation with stockholders (when  appropriate);

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews the composition, functioning and effectiveness of  the Board and its committees, and oversees the self-assessment of the Board and its committees.  
[END TABLE]
Communications with the Board 
If you wish to communicate with the Board, you may send your communication in writing to: 
Secretary 
Incyte Corporation 
1801 Augustine Cut-Off 
Wilmington, DE 19803 
You must include your name and address in the written communication and indicate whether you are a stockholder of the Company. 
The Secretary will review any communications received from a stockholder and all material communications from stockholders will be forwarded to the appropriate director or directors or Committee of the Board based on the subject matter. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Our policy is that all employees, officers and directors must avoid any activity that is or has the appearance of conflicting with the interests of the Company. This policy is included in our Code of Business Conduct, Ethics and Board Code of Conduct and Ethics. We conduct a review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis and all such transactions must be approved by the Audit Committee or another independent body of the Board. 
Compensation of Directors 
Our director compensation program is designed to enable continued attraction and retention of highly qualified non-employee directors by ensuring that our director compensation is in line with compensation offered by our peer companies that compete with us for director talent. The program is designed to address the time, effort, expertise, and accountability required of active board membership. Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive any fees for their service on the Board or any committee. Mr. Hoppenot is the Company's only employee director. The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, periodically reviews the compensation for our non-employee directors in relation to the peer group used for compensation purposes (as described below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"). 
In the course of our stockholder engagement during 2018, it became clear that it was time to re-evaluate our director compensation practices. Existing director compensation practices included an equity grant of a fixed number of options. A consensus was forming among several of our stockholders that the equity component of director compensation should, instead, aim to deliver a fixed value. The goal of fixed-value equity compensation is to ensure that overall compensation amounts are generally consistent over time, thus avoiding the up-and-down values that occur when equity compensation grants are fixed to a particular number of stock options. Accordingly, based on the Compensation Committee's most recent review in September 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and, in March 2019, the Board of Directors approved the changes in non-employee director compensation described below, noting the continued heavy weighting of compensation toward equity and stock options. These changes will take effect upon the approval of amendments to our Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 Stock Incentive Plan"), as described below under "Proposal 3." 
Cash Compensation 
Effective as of the date of stockholder approval of Proposal 3, the amendments to the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, each non-employee director, other than the Lead Independent Director, will receive a $60,000 annual retainer, payable quarterly, and prorated for such portion of the year that the director serves on the Board. The Lead Independent Director will receive a $90,000 annual retainer. The chair of the Audit Committee will receive an additional $25,000 annual retainer, and each other member of the Audit Committee will receive an additional $12,000 annual retainer. The chair of the Compensation Committee will receive an additional $25,000 annual retainer, and each other member of the Compensation Committee will receive an additional $10,000 annual retainer. The chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will receive an additional $16,000 annual retainer, and each other member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will receive an additional $8,000 annual retainer. The chair of the Finance Committee receives an additional $15,000 annual retainer, and each other member of the Finance Committee receives an additional $8,000 annual retainer. All retainers will be prorated for such portion of the year that the director serves on the Board. 
Non-employee directors have the option to elect to receive their retainers and committee fees in the form of restricted stock that vests immediately when the associated quarterly retainer amount is paid. All directors are reimbursed for their travel and out-of-pocket expenses in accordance with our travel policy for each in-person Board or committee meeting that they attend. 
Equity Compensation 
In addition to cash compensation for services as a member of the Board, non-employee directors also receive equity awards. If our stockholders approve Proposal 3, the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan will be amended to provide that following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting and each future annual meeting of our stockholders, each non-employee director who continues to serve as a member of the Board will receive awards with a grant date value of $500,000, of which 75% would be in the form of stock options and 25% would be in the form of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, determined in the same manner as with awards to our executive officers, as described below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The exercise price of the options will be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, and the options will have a term of ten years. Each of these options and RSUs will vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant or, if earlier, the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders or upon a change in control. The initial stock option grants described in the next paragraph will be eliminated. 
Prior to the date of stockholder approval of Proposal 3, each new non-employee director appointed to the Board will receive an initial stock option to purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The initial stock option vests and becomes exercisable as to 25% of those shares on the first anniversary of the date of the grant, and the remaining shares vest and become exercisable monthly over the following three years. In addition, on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director who continues to serve as a member of the Board will receive an option to purchase 15,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Each of these annually granted options will vest in full on the first anniversary of the date of the grant or, if earlier, the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders or upon a change in control. 
Under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, when a new non-employee director is appointed to the Board at a time other than at an annual meeting, the director receives a pro rata portion of the automatic annual grants. On May 1, 2018, the date of our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each then continuing non-employee director received his or her annual grant of an option to purchase 15,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
The table below shows the compensation paid to each non-employee director for his or her service in 2018:

Compensation Program Strategy and Objectives 
The Compensation Committee of our Board believes that the compensation of our executive officers should: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage both creation of stockholder value and achievement of strategic corporate objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Integrate compensation with our annual and long-term corporate objectives and  strategy, and focus executive behavior on the fulfillment of both of those objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide a competitive total compensation package that enables us to attract and retain, on a  long-term basis, qualified personnel; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide fair compensation consistent with internal compensation programs.  
[END TABLE]
Our executive officers' compensation currently includes three primary components: base salary, cash bonus, and equity-based incentive awards. Equity-based incentive awards can be made up of restricted stock units, performance shares or stock options. Salary is a fixed amount and does not vary with our performance. All other components of our executives' compensation are closely tied to our Company's performance – either through the amounts (if any) of each component actually received or the value of each component over time, or both – and each contributes toward our goal of delivering long-term stockholder value. Each of the equity-based components – including the performance shares that only become earned upon achievement of pre-determined goals – are also subject to time-based vesting, which the Compensation Committee believes incentivizes executive retention. The performance-based components and time-based components of our equity compensation program are designed to encourage both an appropriate level of risk-taking and a focus on sound long-term decision-making, thus aligning executive interests with the long-term best interests of our Company and our stockholders. The chart below sets out each of these components.

As the design of our executive compensation program shows, the Compensation Committee believes that executive compensation should be designed to pay for performance. Our Company has been very successful in recent years, and executive compensation has reflected that performance. While 2018 was also successful in many respects, we did miss a very important development goal when our ECHO-301 trial failed, resulting in a lower cash bonus of 81% of target as well as decreased value of equity holdings. In addition, in the case of performance shares which were tied to pre-determined, internal, stretch revenue targets, the shares earned amounted to only 83% of target shares. The charts below illustrate how our CEO's compensation is closely tied to our Company's performance goals over the last three years and how the percentage of our CEO's compensation that is tied to performance compares with those of our peer group of companies. The chart below illustrates this evolution with respect to our CEO's compensation, demonstrating that our CEO's total compensation tracks our achievement of Board-approved corporate goals:

Implementing Our Objectives – Role of Compensation Committee and Our Chief Executive Officer 
The Compensation Committee approves, administers and interprets our executive compensation and benefits policies, including our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of our CEO and determines his compensation in light of the goals and objectives of our compensation program. Our CEO and the Compensation Committee together assess the performance of our other executive officers and determine their compensation, based on initial recommendations from our CEO. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain any independent compensation consultant or other advisor as the Committee may deem appropriate. Pursuant to this authority, the Compensation Committee has engaged Compensia, a national compensation consulting firm, for support on matters related to the compensation of our executive officers. Compensia does not provide any other services to our Company. 
Compensia was retained by the Compensation Committee to prepare compensation analyses for our executive officers and the non-employee members of our Board of Directors. Specifically, Compensia was directed to provide a competitive market analysis of the base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive equity compensation of our executive officers compared against our compensation peer groups and to review other market practices and trends. This market analysis was reviewed with the Compensation Committee in connection with its January 2018 compensation decisions, and was used to guide decisions regarding base salary adjustments and target annual cash and equity incentive award opportunities. Updated data prepared by Compensia were used to inform the July 2018 equity award decisions made by the Compensation Committee. 
Market Reference Data 
While the Compensation Committee reviews market benchmarks, it does not necessarily target a specific percentile within our peer group but rather utilizes market reference data to evaluate the competitiveness of our executive officers' compensation and to determine whether the total compensation paid to each of our named executive officers was reasonable in the aggregate. 
In connection with its analysis for purposes of 2018 compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviewed information prepared by Compensia comparing the compensation for our executive officers with data from SEC filings and the Radford Life Sciences Survey for a peer group comprised of 16 publicly-traded biopharmaceutical companies. Where peer data was unavailable, Compensia used survey data from the Mercer SIRS Survey. We collectively refer to this data as the competitive compensation data. 
The peer group for 2018 compensation decisions, referred to as the 2018 peer group, was chosen based on the following characteristics: major labor and capital market competitors, broadly similar size in revenue, market capitalization and headcount, and similar product and business models. 
In September 2018, the peer group was changed because one company, Bioverativ, had been acquired and another company, Tesaro, no longer met our revenue and market capitalization criteria. Two new companies that did meet our criteria, Jazz Pharmaceuticals and Neurocrine Biosciences, were added to our peer group to replace the dropped companies. This updated peer group was used for 2019 compensation decisions and is referred to as the 2019 peer group. 
The following table sets forth our peer group criteria and a comprehensive list of the peer group companies used for 2018 and 2019 compensation decisions: 
How We Establish Our Peer Group 
Using recent data as of December 31, 2018, the following tables illustrate Incyte's twelve trailing months of revenue performance relative to the 2019 peer group and also illustrate our relative headcount and revenue-to-employee ratio compared to the 2019 peer group. We believe this data helps underscore the efficiency of our operations.

Revenue to Employee Ratio vs. Peers 
Recent Evaluation of Our Equity Grant Practices 
In July 2016, the Compensation Committee, after consulting with Compensia with respect to peer group practices, revised our equity grant guidelines. In 2016 and 2017, 75% of the value of an executive officer's annual equity-based incentive awards were in the form of stock options while the remaining 25% were in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs). 
In response to stockholder feedback, in 2018, the Compensation Committee changed the RSU portion to performance share awards, which combine the time-based vesting aspects of RSUs with a performance-based vesting requirement, resulting in 75% of the value being in the form of stock options and 25% in performance share awards. 
In 2019, the Compensation Committee noted Compensia's observation that our mix for executives of 75% stock options and 25% performance shares put our executives' equity-based compensation more at-risk than our peer group and the broader market norm and that, on average, our peers deliver approximately 25% of executive equity compensation value in the form of time-based vesting RSUs, with approximately 50% being delivered in the form of stock options and approximately 25% being delivered in the form of performance-based shares or options. The Committee also noted that, due to our stock price decline and limited use of RSUs, realizable compensation for our executives for 2016 through 2018 fell well below target compensation values. Accordingly, to enhance executive retention and bring our executive equity compensation practices in line with our peers, the Committee determined that, for 2019, our executives will receive 50% of their grant date target value in the form of stock options, 25% in the form of performance shares, and 25% in the form of RSUs. 
While the equity awards are actually granted in July of each year, the Compensation Committee determines the overall equity grant target value for our executive officers in the early portion of the year, in conjunction with the determination of base salary adjustments and the establishment of the annual incentive compensation plan described in greater detail below. Based on those target values, the share numbers of our annual stock option grants are determined in the middle of each calendar year, with one-half of the grants made at that time and one-half made at the beginning of the following calendar year, with a view toward countering some of the effects of the volatile trading price of our common stock. Our annual stock option grants have a ten-year term with four-year service-based vesting with one-quarter vesting after one year and the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments. Our annual executive performance share and RSU awards are made in the middle of each calendar year. The performance share awards vest, assuming performance goals are achieved at specified levels, in equal annual installments over four years and are described further below. The RSU awards vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
The Compensation Committee also has the discretion to make outstanding merit stock option awards, which have a ten-year term and vest in a single installment after four years. Those awards, if granted, can be made to executives other than our CEO as well as other key employees throughout our Company and are typically made in connection with salary adjustments at the beginning of each year as the awards are intended to relate to prior year performance and to incentivize and retain the recipients. Our CEO championed the creation of the outstanding merit grant program to recognize important contributions – both within a function and the Company as a whole - by leaders throughout our organization. Previously, our CEO received these grants too, but, starting in 2019, in response to stockholder feedback, the Compensation Committee eliminated awards of outstanding merit grants to our CEO. 
In addition, as described below, in June 2018, the Compensation Committee made retention plan awards to certain key R&D and salesforce employees, including the grant of performance share awards to certain executive officers (not including our CEO). 
The exercise price of each stock option awarded under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan is the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, which for our annual stock option grants are the dates of the regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings or actions without meetings, which are taken following decisions at meetings, in the middle of the year at which equity awards for senior executives are formally determined and at the beginning of the year at which salary adjustments and cash bonuses under our incentive compensation plan are determined. These meetings are scheduled in advance, and we do not coordinate the timing of equity award grants with the release of financial results or other material announcements by our Company. Under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, we may not reprice or replace options at lower exercise prices without stockholder approval. 
Compensation Practices and Policies 
Equity Ownership Guidelines.    Effective January 1, 2016, our Board adopted robust equity ownership guidelines for members of senior management, including our executive officers, and members of the Board. Under these guidelines, the covered individuals are expected to meet the following equity ownership requirements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO   6x Annual Base Salary 
 All Other Executive Officers   3x Annual Base Salary 
 Non-Employee Members of the Board   6x Annual Cash Retainer 
[END TABLE]
All directors and executive officers have either met their respective equity ownership targets or are within the five-year period for achieving compliance. 
Covered individuals as of January 1, 2016 must satisfy these guidelines by December 31, 2020, and individuals who subsequently become subject to the guidelines will have five years to reach their ownership requirements. Shares held directly, shares held indirectly, such as by a trust or a 401(k) plan, unvested restricted shares and RSUs, and shares underlying vested stock options are included in determining an individual's equity ownership. Unvested stock options and unearned performance shares are not counted toward meeting these guidelines. 
Compensation Recovery Policy. In late 2017, in response to our 2017 stockholder engagement campaign (described more fully under "Stockholder Engagement" on page 6), our Compensation Committee adopted a compensation recovery ("clawback") policy which provides that, in the event that, on account of fraud or other intentional misconduct, we are required to prepare an accounting restatement, we may recover from any executive officer any incentive compensation erroneously paid or awarded in excess of what would have been paid under the accounting restatement. This policy applies prospectively to certain incentive compensation paid or awarded after January 1, 2018, its effective date, and covers the three-year period preceding the date on which we are required to prepare the accounting restatement. The incentive compensation to which it applies is cash bonuses or other cash awards to the extent those bonuses or awards are earned based on the attainment of a financial reporting measure presented in our financial statements or derived from our accounting records. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which provides that if we are required as a result of misconduct to restate our financial results due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, our CEO and Chief Financial Officer may be legally required to reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation they receive. To the extent our policy is inconsistent with any final regulations adopted by the SEC to implement the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we intend to revise our policy to comply with those regulations. 
Limitations on Hedging and Pledging.    Under our insider trading policy, our employees, including our executive officers, and Board members are prohibited from trading in our securities on a short-term basis, purchasing our securities on margin, making short sales in our securities, buying or selling put or call options on our stock, pledging our securities as collateral for a loan, and engaging in other hedging or monetization transactions such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, that permit a holder to continue to own our securities but, without the full risks and rewards of ownership. 
Effects of Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation, Stockholder Engagement 
Approximately 72% of the votes cast in the stockholder advisory "say on pay" vote on executive compensation in 2018 approved our executive compensation described in last year's proxy statement. Throughout the 2018 proxy season, we engaged directly or indirectly through our proxy solicitor, D. F. King & Co., with investors across the vast majority of our stockholder base, representing over 80% of our outstanding shares at that time, including our top ten stockholders. The Compensation Committee considered the result of the stockholder advisory vote as generally strong support for its overall compensation policies, practices and philosophy for our executive officers while also clearly understanding the perspective from several of our stockholders that some change was needed. Accordingly, as a result of this valuable stockholder feedback, the Compensation Committee eliminated the practice of granting special option grants (now called outstanding merit option grants) to our CEO on an ad hoc basis. 
While say-on-pay votes are a key indicator of stockholder feedback, we are committed to keeping an open dialogue with our stockholders, including our institutional investors, throughout the year, not just during proxy season. We regularly and frequently engage with our stockholders to discuss business topics, seek feedback on our performance and address other matters of importance to our stockholders, such as executive compensation and corporate governance. Even though our 2017 say-on-pay vote resulted in nearly unanimous approval of our compensation practices, our 2017 stockholder engagement campaign (described more fully under "Stockholder Engagement" on page 6) made clear that a persistent stockholder concern was that our executive compensation program did not include any performance-based shares tied to financial metrics. As a result, and as described elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee included performance shares tied to pre-specified performance goals (which were revenue-based for 2018) starting with the equity grant cycle in July 2018. These performance share awards comprised 25% of each executive officer's target equity award value for 2018 and 2019. 
The Compensation Committee intends to continue to regularly review, assess and, when appropriate, adjust our compensation practices based on feedback from our stockholders or other determinations informed by best practices and trends. 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to our CEO and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (excluding the chief financial officer for taxable years prior to 2018). Section 162(m) historically permitted deductions in excess of $1,000,000 for "performance-based compensation," which included stock options meeting certain requirements, but the exception for "performance-based compensation" has been repealed effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
Stock options that we granted in 2017 and prior years should still qualify for full deductibility under a transition rule for amounts payable pursuant to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. To maintain flexibility in compensating our executive officers, the Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy requiring all executive compensation to be deductible. 
Key Elements of Executive Compensation 
Our executive officers' compensation currently includes three primary components: base salary, cash bonus, and long-term equity-based incentive awards. Of these components, only base salary is not tied directly and meaningfully to our Company's performance because base salary is intended to attract and retain key talent by providing a stable source of income. In addition, we provide our executive officers a variety of benefits that are available generally to all salaried employees. Each of these components is described in more detail below. 
Base Salary 
Base salaries are designed to attract and retain qualified personnel by providing a consistent cash flow throughout the year as compensation for acceptable levels of performance of day-to-day responsibilities. Base salaries for our executive officers are established based on the scope of their responsibilities, their performance, and their prior relevant background, training and experience, taking into account competitive market compensation paid by the companies represented in the compensation data we review for similar positions and the overall market demand for those executive officers at the time of hire. The Compensation Committee reviews salaries on an annual basis. At such time, the Compensation Committee may change each executive officer's salary based on the individual's contributions and responsibilities over the prior twelve months and any change in competitive market pay levels. 
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee set the 2018 base salaries for our executive officers. The Committee considered our Company's performance in 2017, including our commercial operations, clinical trial progress of our other drug candidates, job performance, internal pay alignment and equity, marketplace competitiveness and the 2018 peer group data in determining the base salaries for 2018. 
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee set the 2019 base salaries for our executive officers. The Committee considered our Company's performance in 2018, including our commercial operations, clinical trial progress of our other drug candidates, job performance, internal pay alignment and equity, marketplace competitiveness and the 2019 peer group data in determining the base salaries for 2019. The following table sets forth the salary history of our named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table and for Christiana Stamoulis, our new Chief Financial Officer.

For each of 2018 and 2019, 3.0% was the average base salary increase for all of our non-executive employees. 
Annual Incentive Compensation Plan 
Each year, we have established an incentive compensation plan that provides for cash incentive awards for all of our eligible employees. The plans have been designed to pay for performance by aligning incentive awards for each participant with an evaluation of our achievement of corporate objectives. These corporate objectives are approved by the independent members of our Board based on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, as well as, in the case of individuals other than our CEO, the achievement of individual business objectives for a particular year. Eligibility to participate in the plans and actual award amounts are not guaranteed and are determined, in the case of our executive officers, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. After the completion of each year, the Compensation Committee reviews with our CEO the level of achievement of the corporate objectives under the plan and determines the size of the overall bonus pool to be used for awards. The Compensation Committee, with input from our CEO with respect to our other executive officers, may use discretion in determining for each executive officer his or her bonus amount. 
Incentive awards for our executive officers were approved by the Compensation Committee and paid in 2019 pursuant to our 2018 incentive compensation plan. Each of our executive officers who was with us for all of 2018, other than our CEO, had a funding target under the plan of 50% of his or her annual base salary for 2018, with the potential for actual awards under the plan to either exceed or be less than the funding target depending upon corporate performance, as well as the executive officer's achievement of certain individual goals that are predetermined by our CEO. Our CEO had a funding target under the plan of 100% of his annual base salary for 2018, with the potential for actual awards under the plan to either exceed or be less than such funding target depending upon corporate performance. Target incentive award amounts for each participant were based on the participant's potential impact on our operating and financial results and on market competitive pay practices. Individual performance goals were also established for eligible employees other than our CEO, and evaluations were based upon whether the employee met, exceeded or did not meet each established goal. The Committee believes that it is appropriate to align a higher percentage of our executive officers' total cash compensation with the achievement of our Board-approved corporate objectives because those objectives are determined with a view toward progressing our Company's business and maximizing stockholder value. Linking a significant percentage of executive officer cash incentive awards to achievement of Committee-approved corporate objectives puts a substantial portion of our CEO's and executive officers' cash compensation at risk, and is another way the Committee has designed executive compensation to pay for performance. 
While executive officers other than our CEO have individual performance objectives that are evaluated by our CEO, the outcome of those objectives did not affect awards under our 2018 incentive compensation plan to those officers, and the award amounts were based solely on achievement of the corporate performance objectives. 
Annual Incentive Compensation Plan 
2018 Corporate Performance Objectives 
Corporate performance objectives for 2018 were based on achievement of drug discovery objectives, drug development objectives, commercial objectives, finance objectives, and technical operations objectives. 
Threshold, target and outperform achievement levels are defined for each corporate objective and, depending on the achievement of those performance levels, a payout ranging from 0% to 150% may be made for each objective. The ECHO-301 component of our drug development objectives was only achievable at the outperform level and related to achieving data sufficient for a regulatory submission. Bonus objectives included an extra 5% for drug discovery, an extra 25% for drug development, and an extra 5% for business development. Collectively, the bonus opportunities enabled the payout of up to an additional 35 percentage points for extraordinary achievements beyond core objectives. 
At the time the corporate performance objectives for 2018 were set, the Committee and management believed that achievement of the target levels of performance for the non-ECHO-301 objectives would be difficult and challenging, but achievable with significant effort and skill, favorable preclinical study and clinical trial results and continued strong commercial performance. As noted above, achievement of the ECHO-301 component of our drug development objectives were dependent on clinical trial results. 
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee evaluated the achievement of the 2018 corporate performance objectives and determined that incentive awards under our 2018 incentive compensation plan should be based upon achievement of 81% of the target level of corporate performance objectives. While the Committee noted that the business development bonus opportunity relating to the establishment of a strategic relationship that provides near-term sales revenues was not met, the Committee determined that our establishment of our strategic collaboration in China with Innovent warranted the award of two percentage points. The various objective categories, target payouts and actual payouts, are listed in the table below.

[END TABLE]
Our incentive compensation program is designed to incentivize employees, including our executive officers, in every area of our Company, which we believe helps lead to significant achievement across all areas. Our Compensation Committee believes that measuring and rewarding achievements from all functions — including functions such as discovery, development, technical operations and business development, whose efforts take a much longer time to make an impact on our top-line revenue or on our stock price — helps ensure that we are properly incentivizing the collective efforts that lead not only to successful current commercial performance but also critically set the stage for potential continued growth and potential long-term sustained success in the years ahead. Our Compensation Committee also believes that linking incentive compensation to corporate goals aligns employees' incentives with strategic imperatives, thus paying for performance. 
The chart below illustrates the achievement levels under our incentive compensation program over the last three years, and illustrates how the annual incentive compensation plan serves to execute on the Compensation Committee's goal of paying for performance: 
Incentive Compensation Plan Achievement — 2016-2018 
Annual Incentive Compensation Plan 
2019 Corporate Performance Objectives 
In January 2019, our Board, based on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, approved corporate objectives for our 2019 incentive compensation plan. Under this plan, the funding targets for our executive officers remain the same as for 2018. Corporate performance objectives for 2019 are based on achievement of drug discovery objectives, drug development objectives and commercial objectives. 
Threshold, target and outperform achievement levels are defined for each corporate objective and, depending on the achievement of those performance levels, a payout ranging from 0% to 150% may be made for each objective. Bonus objectives include an extra 5% for Drug Discovery, an extra 20% for Drug Development, and an extra 10% for Business Development. Collectively, the bonus opportunities enable the payout of up to an additional 35 percentage points for extraordinary achievements beyond core objectives. 
The Committee and management believe that achievement of the target levels of performance will be difficult and challenging, but achievable with significant effort and skill, favorable preclinical study and clinical trial results and continued strong commercial performance. 
Equity-Based Incentive Awards 
The Compensation Committee administers equity-based incentive awards, such as stock option grants, RSUs and performance shares that are made to our executive officers under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that by providing those persons who have substantial responsibility for our management and growth with an opportunity to increase their ownership of our stock, the best interests of our stockholders and executive officers will be closely aligned. Therefore, executive officers are eligible to receive equity-based incentive awards when the Compensation Committee performs its annual review, although these awards may be granted at other times in recognition of exceptional achievements. As is the case when the amounts of base salary and initial equity awards are determined, the Compensation Committee conducts a review of all components of an executive officer's compensation when determining annual equity awards to ensure that the executive's total compensation conforms to our overall philosophy and objectives. 
Under our 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, we may grant restricted shares, performance shares, RSUs or stock appreciation rights. 
In 2018, our executive officers received stock options and performance shares and, for 2019, our executive officers will receive stock options, performance shares, and RSUs. The value of all of these awards are inherently performance-based. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options are performance based because they pay nothing to our executive officers unless stockholders benefit by stock  price appreciation. In addition, with a ten-year life and a four-year vesting period, stock options are in sync with the time required for discovery, development and  commercialization of new medicines. Our Compensation Committee believes that stock options help align executives' interests with the long-term interests of our Company and our stockholders. Stock options  reinforce our belief that future potential growth of Incyte will be generated by innovation, our discovery and development pipeline, demand for our products and our commercial execution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance shares do not become earned unless pre-determined performance goals are  met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSU awards grow or decline in value based on stock price, also linking executive officers' compensation to the value  delivered to stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the performance-based aspects of stock options, performance shares and RSUs, the four-year vesting periods of all of these awards also serves a critical retention function. Time-based vesting helps ensure the long-term retention of highly valuable executive officers, in whom we have invested considerable time and money, and the intellectual capital they create as well as continuity of their respective teams. The performance-based components and time-based components of our equity compensation program are designed to encourage both an appropriate level of risk-taking and a focus on sound long-term decision making, thus aligning executive interests with the long-term best interests of our Company and our stockholders. 
For our 2018 annual equity grants, stock options comprised 75% of an executive officer's target equity compensation and performance shares comprised 25%. As described above under "—Equity Grant Practices," for 2019 the Compensation Committee has determined that our executive officers' annual equity award mix should be 50% stock options, 25% performance shares and 25% RSUs to bring our practices in line with our peer group and the broader market norm and to provide greater retentive value from our equity awards. 
Performance shares granted in July 2018 had revenue triggers that were determined by the Compensation Committee in February 2018. Depending on revenue actually achieved, the payout on these performance shares could have varied from 0% to 150% of target. These performance shares comprise 25% of an executive officer's target equity compensation awarded in connection with our annual equity grants. The Compensation Committee believes that these performance shares align our executive officers' interest even more closely with the financial performance of our Company and the eventual value delivered to stockholders. For 2018, the revenue target for the performance shares that would have yielded a 100% payout was an aspirational, internal, stretch target. The Compensation Committee believes such stretch revenue targets help incentivize executives to achieve maximum performance and are a key element of the pay-for-performance strategy. While we achieved record revenue in 2018, we nevertheless did not achieve the internal, stretch target. Accordingly, in February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that the performance shares earned were only 83% of the target payout. 
Performance Share Achievement 2018 
Target Value of 2018 Equity Grants 
For the 2018 annual equity grants, our CEO received awards with a grant date target value of $7,000,000 and each of our executive vice presidents received awards with a grant date target value of $1,800,000, in each case, unchanged from the values awarded in July 2017. 
While, for our CEO, the Compensation Committee did not target a particular peer group percentile in setting the 2018 equity award values, in July 2018 when the Compensation Committee was actually granting these awards, it noted that then current peer group data indicated that the value of peer group long-term incentive awards had increased. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee noted that our CEO's 2018 equity awards would result in target total direct compensation (target total cash compensation plus long-term incentive value of equity awards) approximating only the 30th percentile of our peer group. The Compensation Committee further noted that, for calendar year 2018, when including the outstanding merit stock option grant made to our CEO in January 2018 that was intended to relate to 2017 performance, our CEO's target total direct compensation would approximate the peer group 40th percentile. 
Similarly, for executive officers other than our CEO, the Compensation Committee noted in July 2018 that, because the value of peer group long-term incentive awards had increased since January 2018 when our equity target values were established, target award values likely no longer approximated the peer group 60th percentile. 
Nevertheless, despite these target equity award values being lower relative to our then current peer group than initially designed to be, the Compensation Committee decided - in keeping with its pay-for-performance philosophy - that no changes would be made at that time. 
For a discussion of updates to the equity grant target values undertaken by the Compensation Committee in 2019, see "—Target Value of 2019 Equity Grants" on page 45. 
Outstanding Merit Grants 
In January 2018, certain of our named executive officers received outstanding merit option grants intended to incentivize and retain those individuals. Our CEO received a grant with a grant date target value of $1,200,000 and certain other named executive officers - Drs. Huber, Stein and Yao - received grants with a grant date target value of $1,000,000. These outstanding merit option grants are subject to four-year cliff vesting. As noted above under "—Compensation Practices and Policies—Effects of Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation," the Compensation Committee has now eliminated the practice of awarding outstanding merit option grants (formerly named special option grants) to our CEO and no such grant was made in 2019. 
2018 Retention Plans 
With the failure of our ECHO-301 program in April 2018 and the significant stock price decline which accompanied it, the Compensation Committee believed it was vital to act to preserve the two key engines of growth within Incyte – namely, the salesforce which generates the revenue to fund our day-to-day operations and the R&D effort which aims to produce the compounds that will potentially lead to future growth. Accordingly, in June 2018, the Compensation Committee adopted retention plans utilizing performance share awards for certain groups of employees of our Company, namely key R&D employees and our salesforce. The R&D retention plan participants included three of our named executive officers, Drs. Huber, Stein and Yao, who each received performance share awards potentially representing 50,000 shares of common stock, which would be earned based on a specific number of investigational new drug (IND) filings made by our Company during a specified time frame and, if earned, would vest on the third anniversary of the initial grant date. 
Full Value Share Issuance Limits 
While the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may elect to make grants of restricted shares, performance shares, RSUs or stock appreciation rights if it deems it advisable, the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan contains a limit on the total amount of shares that may be issued other than upon the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights or pursuant to sales of restricted shares at purchase prices at least equal to the fair market value of the shares sold. That limit is currently 3,500,000 shares and is proposed to be eliminated in connection with the amendments to the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan described under Proposal 3. 
Termination Based Compensation Under Employment Agreements and Offer Letters 
Our executive officers are parties to employment agreements and offer letters, as described below under "Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements." 
These employment agreements and offer letters provide for severance payments and acceleration of vesting of equity-based awards upon termination of employment under the circumstances described below under "Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements." In general, the employment agreements provide for severance benefits if an officer's employment is terminated within 24 months following a change in control. These agreements are designed both to attract executives, as we compete for talented employees in a marketplace where such protections are routinely offered, and to retain executives and provide continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control. 
Other Compensation 
All of our full-time employees, including our executive officers, may participate in our health programs, such as medical, dental and vision care coverage, and our 401(k) and life and disability insurance programs. These benefits are designed to provide our executive officers and eligible employees a competitive total compensation package that enables us to attract and retain qualified personnel. Under our employment agreement with our CEO, we paid the premiums with respect to a six-year insurance policy that becomes payable to the CEO or his estate upon his disability or death, although at his suggestion we recently amended his employment agreement to eliminate our obligation to pay the last year's premium on that insurance policy, as described below under "Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements." 
Target Value of 2019 Equity Grants 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee established grant date target values for the 2019 annual equity grants for our CEO and other executive officers. In determining to establish a grant date target value of $12,900,000 for our CEO, the Committee noted that the 2019 peer group data presented to the Committee in November 2018 indicated that our CEO's target total direct compensation (target total cash compensation plus long-term incentive value) for 2018 approximated the peer 25th percentile despite his target total cash compensation (base salary plus target bonus) approximating the peer 50th percentile. The Committee noted our Company's overall performance in 2018 despite the ECHO-301 disappointment and the CEO's strong leadership following that development as our Company continued to increase product revenues and continued to advance product candidates through our clinical pipeline, with a number of late-stage candidates that can accelerate near-term growth. Our CEO's 2019 equity grant date target value approximates the 2019 peer group 68th percentile for long-term incentive value and places him at approximately the peer 67th percentile for target total direct compensation. The Committee established grant date target values of $2,200,000 for each of our other executive officers who is eligible to receive annual equity grants in 2019, intended generally to approximate the peer 60th percentile for long-term incentive value. Ms. Stamoulis joined us in February 2019, received initial equity awards with an aggregate grant date target value of $3,300,000 on joining us, and will not receive a 2019 annual equity award but instead will be entitled to receive, on the first anniversary of the commencement of her employment and in July 2020, equity awards with an aggregate grant date target value of $1,300,000 and $2,200,000, respectively. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Hoppenot, our CEO. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other than our CEO), was $228,006; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented elsewhere in this Proxy  Statement, was $9,314,189.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Hoppenot, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all  employees was 41 to 1.   
   Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Hoppenot, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all  employees was 41 to 1.   
   Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Hoppenot, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all  employees was 41 to 1.   
[END TABLE]
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of 1,367 employees, with 1,106 based in  the United States and 261 based in Europe and Japan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected December 31, 2018, which is within the last three months of 2018, as the date upon which we would identify  the "median employee."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For all employees, we examined total compensation, which included: base salary, incentive compensation plan payments for non-sales employees, sales incentive compensation plan payments for sales employees, equity awards consisting of stock options and restricted stock units, and other compensation such as 401(k) matching contributions  and Company-paid life insurance premiums.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis, and we annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We did not make any cost-of-living  adjustments in identifying the "median employee."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For employees outside the United States, we converted their compensation to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate  for 2018.

(1)  The target amounts shown reflect our annual incentive plan awards originally provided under the 2018 incentive  compensation plan and represent the pre-established target awards as a percentage of base salary for the 2018 fiscal year, with the potential for actual awards under the plan to either exceed or be less than  such funding target depending upon corporate performance. Actual award amounts are not guaranteed and are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, which may consider an individual's performance during the period. For  additional information, please refer to the section titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Key Elements of Executive Compensation—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan." Actual 2018 incentive  compensation plan payouts are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.

(2)  The threshold amounts shown illustrate the smallest payout that can be made under the 2018 incentive compensation plan if  all of the pre-established performance objectives are achieved at the minimum achievement level. The target amounts shown are the payouts that can be made if all of the  pre-established performance objectives have been achieved at the target achievement level and, as noted in footnote (1), correlate to the pre-established target awards  as a percentage of base salary. The maximum amounts shown are the greatest payout that can be made if all of the pre-established maximum performance objectives are achieved or exceeded at the outperform  achievement levels and all potential bonus points under the 2018 incentive compensation plan were earned. Actual awards may be more or less than these amounts and, as

(3)  Awards under these columns represent performance shares. For the awards made on June 28, 2018, the performance shares  become earned only if a specified number of investigational new drug (IND) filings are made during a specified time frame and, if earned, would vest on the third anniversary of the initial grant date. For the awards made on July 2, 2018, the  actual number of number of shares of common stock into which each performance share award may convert will be calculated by multiplying the target number of performance shares allocated to that award by performance percentage multipliers ranging  from 0% to 150% based on the actual level at which the applicable revenue-based performance goal is achieved, as certified by the Compensation Committee. The performance period was the year ended December 31, 2018 and achievement of maximum,  target and threshold levels will result in percentage multipliers of 150%, 100% and 50%, respectively, with achievement below the threshold level resulting in a percentage multiplier of 0%. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board  of Directors determined that the performance shares were earned at the 83% level, resulting in 20,571 shares being earned by Mr. Hoppenot and 5,389 shares earned by the other executive officers who received performance shares, and the earned  shares will vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date of July 2, 2018. For additional information, please refer to the section titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and  Analysis—Key Elements of Executive Compensation—Equity Based Incentive Awards."

There can be no assurance that options will be exercised (in which case no value will be realized by the individual), that the value on  exercise of options will approximate the compensation expense we recognized, or that the price of our common stock when RSUs vest and if and when performance shares vest will equal or exceed the price of our common stock on the date of the  applicable RSU or performance share award. The grant date fair values of performance shares were calculated by multiplying the closing price of our common stock on the grant date by the target number of shares payable if the performance targets for  those shares are achieved at the target level of 100%.

Salary 
The annual salaries of the named executive officers are reflected under the Salary column of the Summary Compensation Table. The Compensation Committee reviews salaries on an annual basis, and may change each executive officer's salary based on the individual's contributions and responsibilities over the prior twelve months and any change in comparable company pay levels. In 
 January 2018, the Compensation Committee set the 2018 base salaries for our executive officers. Salary compensation is discussed in greater detail under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
Incentive Compensation 
All named executive officers who continued to be employed by us at the time of the January 2019 Compensation Committee determination with respect to achievement under our discretionary 2018 incentive compensation plan received a bonus for the 2018 fiscal year under that plan, although the bonus for Ms. Pasquale was the negotiated amount determined in connection with the commencement of her employment in April 2018. This bonus is reflected under the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table because the bonus is tied to the corporate performance of the Company. The plan established cash incentive awards for all of our eligible employees for 2018, and was designed to align incentive awards for each participant's individual performance with our corporate goals. Incentive awards for our executive officers were approved by the Compensation Committee in January 2019 and paid in February 2019 pursuant to this plan. Our executive officers each had a funding target under the plan, with the potential for actual awards under the plan to either exceed or be less than such funding target depending upon corporate performance, as well as each executive officer's individual performance. The range of the 2018 awards at the time of establishment of the plan is set forth under the Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards column to the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. Actual incentive award amounts paid to named executive officers for 2018 pursuant to this plan were based on the achievement of corporate goals that were predetermined by the Compensation Committee, as described in greater detail under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," and is disclosed in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
In January 2018, all named executive officers who were then employed by us received grants of options to purchase common stock in connection with our annual equity award cycle and certain named executive officers also received outstanding merit option grants, and in July 2018, in connection with our annual equity award cycle, all named executive officers received grants of options to purchase common stock and performance shares. As described in greater detail under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the outstanding merit option grants were intended to incentivize and retain the recipients of those grants and the performance shares were tied to a corporate-based performance goal. The numbers and grant date fair values of these awards under ASC 718 are set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The exercise price for options awarded in 2018 was the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The options awarded in January 2018 under our equity grant guidelines will generally vest and become exercisable as to one-fourth of the shares on the first anniversary of the July 2017 grant date, with the remaining shares vesting ratably each month thereafter over the following three years. The options awarded in July 2018 will generally vest and become exercisable as to one-fourth of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining shares vesting ratably each month thereafter over the following three years. The outstanding merit option grants awarded in January 2018 will vest and become exercisable as to all of the shares on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. The options awarded in January 2018 and in July 2018, and outstanding merit option grants, have a term of ten years from the grant date. The performance shares, if earned, will vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
In April 2018, Ms. Pasquale received options and RSUs in connection with her employment with us; the options will vest and become exercisable as to one-fourth of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining shares vesting ratably each month thereafter over the following three years, and the RSUs will vest in equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
In June 2018, certain of our named executive officers were participants in our R&D retention plan and received performance share awards that are described in greater detail under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The amounts, if any, actually realized by the named executive officers for the 2018 awards will vary depending on the vesting of the award and the price of our common stock in relation to the exercise price at the time of exercise. Detail regarding the number of exercisable and unexercisable options held by each named executive officer at year-end is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Company's executive management, reviewed the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees and concluded that risks arising from those policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements 
In April 2014, the Compensation Committee and Management Stock Option Committee approved amendments to outstanding employee stock option and RSU agreements and to the forms of agreements for future employee stock option and RSU agreement to provide that, in the event of a change in control of the Company, (i) if the successor corporation does not assume or substitute comparable awards for all outstanding employee options and RSUs, then as of the date of completion of the change in control transaction, the vesting of such options and RSUs shall be accelerated in full, and (ii) if outstanding options and RSUs are assumed or replaced by comparable awards by the successor corporation and within one year after the change in control, an equity awardee's service as an employee is terminated without cause or due to constructive termination, then the vesting of such person's assumed or substituted options and RSUs shall be accelerated in full. The value of such acceleration in full for each Named Executive Officer, assuming such termination or event was effective as of December 31, 2018, is set forth in the table below under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination in Connection with a Change in Control." 
President and CEO 
In connection with his appointment as President and CEO in January 2014, Mr. Hoppenot and the Company entered into an offer of employment letter and an employment agreement. 
Pursuant to the offer letter, Mr. Hoppenot was entitled to an initial base salary of $800,000 and participated in the Company's annual incentive compensation plan with a funding target for a cash bonus under such plan of 100% of his annual base salary and a minimum bonus for 2014 of $800,000. Mr. Hoppenot's base salary is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. Future bonuses under the incentive compensation plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion based on the achievement of performance goals to be determined annually by the Board or, as applicable, the Committee. Pursuant to the offer letter, Mr. Hoppenot also received a signing bonus of $2,200,000, one quarter of which was paid upon commencement of employment and the remainder of which was paid in equal installments on the first day of each of the second, third and fourth calendar quarters of 2014. Except as otherwise provided in his employment agreement, Mr. Hoppenot must have remained employed by the Company through the first calendar day of each such quarter in order to receive the respective quarterly portion of the signing bonus. 
Mr. Hoppenot received an initial award in January 2014 of options to purchase 124,148 shares of common stock and 17,428 performance shares under the Company's 2010 Stock Incentive Plan with an aggregate value as of the grant date equal to $4,500,000, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistent with the valuation of the Company's equity incentives. Mr. Hoppenot will be eligible to receive future annual equity awards as determined by the Compensation Committee, and all such equity awards, including the initial award, will be subject to vesting or attainment of performance criteria, as applicable, at the same levels as apply to awards of the same type granted to the Company's other senior executives for the same fiscal year. Mr. Hoppenot also received in January 2014 a one-time grant of 400,000 RSUs, designed to make him whole for equity he forfeited at his previous employer and also to further incentivize retention over a six-year period. Each RSU represents the right to acquire one share of the Company's common stock. Vesting of the RSUs will be subject to Mr. Hoppenot's continued employment on the applicable vesting dates, with one-sixth of the RSUs vesting at the end of each of the calendar years 2014 through 2019, subject to earlier acceleration of vesting upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement. 
Termination Without Good Reason Prior to a Change in Control.    If Mr. Hoppenot voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company other than for good reason and other than in the 24-month period following a change in control (the "Change in Control Employment Period"), the Company will pay Mr. Hoppenot, to the extent not already paid, his annual base salary through the date of termination, any deferred compensation and any accrued vacation pay. 
Termination Without Good Reason in Connection with a Change in Control.    If Mr. Hoppenot terminates his employment with the Company without good reason during the Change in Control Employment Period, the Company will pay Mr. Hoppenot, to the extent not already paid, his annual base salary through the date of termination, any deferred compensation, any accrued vacation pay, and an amount equal to a pro rata portion of his target bonus calculated according to the number of days he worked through the date of termination in the current fiscal year. 
Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason Not in Connection with a Change in Control.    If, at any time other than during the Change in Control Employment Period, Mr. Hoppenot's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Hoppenot for good reason, the Company will pay Mr. Hoppenot, to the extent not already paid, his annual base salary through the date of termination, his signing bonus, any deferred compensation, any accrued vacation pay, and an amount equal to a pro rata portion of his target bonus calculated according to the number of days he worked through the date of termination in the current fiscal year. In addition, the Company will pay him an amount equal to the sum of 1.5 times his annual base salary and the greater of his current target bonus or his bonus amount for the preceding fiscal year. The agreement also provides that Mr. Hoppenot's stock options and RSUs (other than his one-time grant of 400,000 RSUs) will vest as to the amount that would have vested had he continued to work for the Company for an additional 18 months. All options would continue to be exercisable for 180 days following the date of termination. In addition, the agreement provides that the 400,000 RSUs granted in connection with joining the Company will vest as to 100% of the amount that would have vested had he continued to work for the Company for an additional 12 months and vest as to 50% of the amount that would have vested had he continued to work for the Company for an additional 12 months subsequent to the initial 12 months after the date of termination. The agreement also provides for the payment of COBRA premiums by the 
 Company, or the cash equivalent thereof, for Mr. Hoppenot and his family for up to 12 months, outplacement services for up 12 months, as well as payment with respect to any other accrued amounts under other of the Company's benefits arrangements. 
Termination in Connection with a Change in Control Without Cause or for Good Reason.    If during the Change in Control Employment Period Mr. Hoppenot's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Hoppenot for good reason, the Company will pay Mr. Hoppenot, to the extent not already paid, his annual base salary through the date of termination, his signing bonus, any deferred compensation, any accrued vacation pay, and an amount equal to a pro rata portion of his target bonus calculated according to the number of days he worked through the date of termination in the current fiscal year. In addition, the Company will pay him an amount equal to three times the sum of his current annual base salary and the greater of his current target bonus or his bonus amount for the preceding fiscal year. The agreement also provides that in the event of such a termination, all of Mr. Hoppenot's unvested RSUs and unvested stock options will vest in full, and all stock options will remain exercisable for 12 months following his termination. In addition, all performance shares will vest in full and be settled assuming the target level of performance has been achieved. The agreement also provides for the continuation of benefits for Mr. Hoppenot and his family for up to 36 months, outplacement services for up 12 months, as well as payment with respect to any other accrued amounts under other of the Company's benefits arrangements. 
Life Insurance and Disability Insurance Coverage.    When Mr. Hoppenot became our CEO in January 2014, after being recruited by our Board, he forfeited certain equity based awards with his previous employer that had provided for an acceleration of vesting of a majority of the awards in the event of his death or permanent disability. Our one-time grant of 400,000 RSUs to Mr. Hoppenot, described above, does not contain a similar provision. To provide Mr. Hoppenot with similar economic value commensurate with the equity based awards he had forfeited in order to join us, we agreed in Mr. Hoppenot's employment agreement to pay the premiums for an insurance policy that will remain in place for the six-year period that commenced on the first day of his employment that will pay $15 million to Mr. Hoppenot upon termination of his employment for disability or his estate on his death. The six-year period for the life and disability insurance is the same vesting period for the 400,000 RSUs. Mr. Hoppenot's initial employment agreement also required us to gross-up each premium amount so that the total payment made by us was sufficient to cover the premiums and all federal, state and local income taxes incurred by Mr. Hoppenot. In April 2015, we amended Mr. Hoppenot's employment agreement so that we would no longer be required to gross-up each premium amount to cover taxes incurred by Mr. Hoppenot. In 2019, at Mr. Hoppenot's suggestion, we amended Mr. Hoppenot's employment agreement so that we would no longer be required to pay the premiums for the life and disability insurance coverage for 2019, the last year of vesting of Mr. Hoppenot's initial RSU grant. 
Other Covenants.    Under the agreement, Mr. Hoppenot is subject to non-solicitation/non-hiring and non-disparagement covenants that extend two years from termination of employment. Upon certain breaches of those covenants after termination of employment, Mr. Hoppenot must forfeit all of his unvested stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the gain or income realized from the exercise, vesting or settlement of the same within 24 months prior to the breach. 
Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers 
In November 2003, our Board approved a form of employment agreement for Executive Vice Presidents and certain other senior employees. The form of employment agreement for the Executive Vice Presidents and certain other senior employees was amended in December 2008 to comply with 
 Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In April 2012, the employment agreements with our Executive Vice Presidents and certain other senior employees were amended to increase the amount payable upon an "involuntary termination" of the executive's employment within 24 months following a change in control. The Company entered into an employment agreement with Reid M. Huber in May 2011, Steven H. Stein in March 2015 and Wenqing Yao in November 2003 while each served as one of our senior employees. The Company entered into an employment agreements with David W. Gryska in October 2014 upon his employment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and with Maria E. Pasquale in April 2018 upon her employment as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. 
The employment agreements with our Executive Vice Presidents provide that in the event of an "involuntary termination" of the executive's employment within 24 months following a change in control (which includes actual termination without cause and constructive termination by way of the assignment of duties substantially and materially inconsistent with the executive's position or other diminishment in position, requiring the executive to be based at any location outside more than 35 miles from the office or location where he or she was based prior to a change in control, a reduction in salary, bonus or adverse change in benefits, or a breach by the Company of the terms of the executive's employment arrangement), we will pay the executive an amount equal to two times the sum of the executive's current annual base salary and the greater of (1) the executive's current target bonus or (2) the executive's bonus amount for the preceding fiscal year. A "change in control" generally includes a significant change in the composition of the Board, the acquisition by any person or entity of greater than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities, the approval of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or similar transaction. We will also pay the executive a pro rata portion of the executive's target bonus calculated according to the number of days the executive worked through the termination date in the current fiscal year. The cash payment would be paid in a lump sum payment following the executive's termination. The agreement also provides that in the event of such a termination, all of the executive's unvested stock options will vest in full, and all stock options will be exercisable for 12 months following the executive's termination. In addition, the agreement provides for the reimbursement of COBRA premiums by the Company for the executive and eligible dependents for up to 12 months, reimbursement (or payment) by the Company for the cost of continued life and disability insurance for the executive for 12 months at the same levels in effect on the termination date, as well as payment with respect to any other accrued amounts under other of the Company's benefits arrangements.

Report of the Audit Committee of the Board 
The Audit Committee of the Board is composed of three directors, each of whom qualifies as "independent" under the current listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The current members of the Audit Committee are Paul J. Clancy, Paul A. Brooke and Wendy L. Dixon. The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter that has been adopted by the Board. The charter is reviewed annually for changes, as appropriate. 
In performing its functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity and necessarily relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which has the primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered public accounting firm, who, in their report, express an opinion on the conformity of the Company's annual financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits, to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or to assess or determine the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Within this framework, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Proposal 2 
Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
This Proposal 2, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, provides our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Under these programs, our named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of annual and long-term corporate objectives, and the creation of increased stockholder value. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers. 
Each year since 2011, we sought, and received, approval for our executive compensation program. In addition, in 2011, and again in 2017, we sought, and received, approval to hold a "say-on-pay" vote each year. Accordingly, we are again asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This Proposal 2 gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is advisory, which means that the vote on executive compensation is not binding on the Company, our Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, we again will ask our stockholders to vote for the following resolution at the annual meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."

Proposal 3 
Proposal to Amend the Amended and Restated 2010 
Stock Incentive Plan 
In March 2019, the Board approved amendments to the Amended and Restated 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (referred to in this proposal description as the "2010 Plan"), subject to the approval of our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, to increase the number of shares available for issuance and make certain additional changes. Incyte has continued to grow at a significant rate. As our revenue and our discovery and development pipeline have substantially increased over the last several years, so too has our number of employees. Our 2016 expansion into Europe and our 2017 expansion into Japan has also contributed to our increasing employee headcount. Even though our employee headcount has risen substantially in the last several years, including in 2018, we have carefully managed the 2010 Plan to ensure that stockholders are subject to minimal dilution and that there is as little overhang as possible on our common stock. In fact, as the chart below shows, since the 2018 amendment to the 2010 Plan that added 6,000,000 shares, our overhang percentage remains low, at 9.1%, and our 3-year average burn rate is 2.26% (assuming that each full value award equates to 2.0 shares and each stock option award equates to 1.0 share), all while our employee headcount has grown by 98% over the past three years.

We believe that we have been careful stewards of the 2010 Plan and we now seek a new amendment to the 2010 Plan to add an additional 7,700,000 shares (as detailed further below) so that we will be in a position to continue our substantial growth as we seek to execute on our 2019 and longer-term strategic goals. 
The following summary of the principal features of the 2010 Plan, as amended, is qualified by reference to the terms of the plan, a copy of which is available without charge upon stockholder request to Secretary, Incyte Corporation, 1801 Augustine Cut-Off, Wilmington, Delaware 19803. The 2010 Plan, as amended, has also been filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission together with this Proxy Statement, and can be accessed on the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov. 
Description of Amendments 
The first amendment to the 2010 Plan approved by the Board and submitted for stockholder approval consists of an increase in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder by 7,700,000 shares, from 36,753,475 shares to 44,453,475 shares. 
The proposed increase of 7,700,000 in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan is needed to allow us to continue to provide effective and appropriate equity incentives to our growing number of employees and our directors. Our equity awards have historically consisted of stock options, RSUs and performance shares. Our Board and the Compensation Committee of the Board have believed that equity awards align compensation incentives with stockholder interests, provide at-risk compensation for management by providing them with a strong incentive to improve the Company's performance, and provide employees with the opportunity to benefit significantly from the success of the Company. We offer equity awards to all new hires and have found that attractive and competitive initial equity awards are often an important inducement for the high-performing, entrepreneurial individuals who we believe are key to our success. We expect to continue to expand our workforce in support of our research and development and commercialization efforts as we execute on our long-term growth strategy. As we recruit to fill these new positions, the amount of shares required for initial awards to new hires, together with the amount required for annual awards to existing employees, in each case consistent with our historical practices, increases. 
We do not believe the proposed 7,700,000 share increase will be unduly dilutive to stockholders. A common measure of potential dilution from outstanding equity awards is "overhang," generally defined as equity awards outstanding but not exercised, plus equity awards available to be granted (together referred to as potential equity award shares), divided by the sum of total common shares outstanding plus potential equity award shares. As of March 12, 2019, our overhang was 9%, as compared with 7% as of February 28, 2018. We believe that our overhang has been reduced as a result of our equity award guidelines that were implemented in January 2014 and July 2016, pursuant to which the number of stock option awards was reduced through the use of RSUs and performance shares. For our annual awards and new employee awards beginning in July 2016, each U.S. recipient received a mix of stock options and RSUs, with the value as of the grant date of the options equal to 662/3% (75% for our executive officers), and the value of the shares underlying the RSU award equal to 331/3% (25% for our executive officers), of the aggregate value of such options and shares, in each case as determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistent with the valuation of our Company's equity incentives. In 2018, we changed the 25% portion of our executive officer awards from RSUs to performance shares, which combine the time-based vesting aspects of RSUs with performance-based vesting requirements, and in 2019, our executive officers will receive for their annual awards a mix of 50% stock options, 25% performance shares and 25% RSUs. Non-U.S. recipients only receive RSUs. 
The second amendment approved by the Board and submitted for stockholder approval would replace the current limitation of 3,500,000 shares that may be issued pursuant to so-called "full value" awards such as RSUs, restricted shares and performance shares (essentially any sales or awards of shares other than upon exercise of options or other than pursuant to sales at purchase prices at least equal to the fair market value of the shares) with a flexible or "fungible" share pool approach. Under this approach, each full value award will reduce the total share pool available under the 2010 Plan by 2.0 shares, and each stock option and any other non-full value award will reduce the total share pool by 1.0 share for each underlying award share granted. This amendment would provide us with more flexibility to use full value awards to compensate our employees and thus reduce the potential dilution of employee awards to our stockholders, while still recognizing the differences in value of each type of award. 
In addition, the Board approved an amendment to the 2010 Plan to restructure the automatic grants of equity awards to our nonemployee "outside" directors. Such directors currently receive an initial grant of options to purchase 25,000 shares at the time of their initial election to the Board, and annual grants of nonstatutory options to purchase 15,000 shares at each regular annual meeting of our stockholders, in each case subject to time-based vesting requirements. If the proposed amendment is approved by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the initial grants of options to purchase 25,000 shares to new outside directors would be eliminated, and the annual grants made to outside directors following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting and each future annual meeting of our stockholders would be changed from a grant of options to purchase 15,000 shares to a grant having an aggregate grant date fair value of $500,000 and entitling the recipient to receive a mix of stock options and RSUs, with the value as of the grant date of the options equal to 75% and the value of the shares underlying the RSU award equal to 25% of the aggregate grant date fair value, in each case as determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistent with the valuation of our Company's equity incentives. The number of shares subject to the options will be determined by dividing 75% of $500,000 (or $375,000) by the Black-Scholes value of one such option, based on the average closing sale price for our shares over the 30 consecutive trading days concluding with the last trading day prior to the grant date, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of shares subject to the RSUs will be determined by dividing 25% of $500,000 (or $125,000) by such 30 trading day average price, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price of the options will be equal to the fair market value on the date of grant, and the options will have a term of ten years. Each outside director who is not initially elected at a regular annual meeting of our stockholders will receive awards having an aggregate grant date fair value of a pro rata portion of $500,000, determined based on the number of full calendar months remaining from the date of election until the next regular annual meeting divided by 12. Such outside director's awards will consist of 75% nonstatutory options and 25% RSUs determined in a manner similar to that used for the annual awards to outside directors following the conclusion of the regular annual meeting, except that the values of the awards to such outside director will be determined as of the grant date of such awards. Under the proposed amendment, all annual awards to outside directors will vest (and, in the case of options, become exercisable) on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or immediately prior to the next regular annual meeting of our stockholders, similar to the current vesting provisions for annual awards to outside directors under the 2010 Plan. 
The last amendment approved by the Board and submitted for stockholder approval is an extension of the termination date of the 2010 Plan, from March 18, 2021 to June 30, 2021. This will allow us to continue using the 2010 Plan for equity awards through the date of our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021. 
2010 Stock Incentive Plan 
The 2010 Plan was initially adopted by the Board in March 2010 and approved by our stockholders in May 2010. It was last amended and restated by the Board in April 2013 and our stockholders approved the amended and restated 2010 Plan in May 2013. The Board further amended the 2010 Plan in 2014, 2016 and 2018, and our stockholders approved each of those amendments. 
The purpose of the 2010 Plan is to assist in the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees, outside directors and consultants who are in a position to make material contributions to our long-term success and the creation of stockholder value. The 2010 Plan offers a significant incentive to encourage our employees, outside directors and consultants by enabling those individuals to acquire shares of our common stock, thereby increasing their proprietary interest in the growth and success of our Company. 
The 2010 Plan provides for the direct award or sale of shares of common stock (including restricted shares), the award of RSUs and stock appreciation rights, the award of performance shares and the grant of incentive stock options to purchase common stock intended to qualify for preferential tax treatment under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and nonstatutory stock options to purchase common stock that do not qualify for such treatment under the Code. All employees, including officers, of the Company or any subsidiary, non-employee directors of the Company and any consultant who performs services for the Company or any subsidiary are eligible to purchase shares of common stock and to receive awards of shares, restricted shares, performance shares, RSUs or stock appreciation rights or grants of nonstatutory stock options. Only employees are eligible to receive grants of incentive stock options. As of December 31, 2018, 1,374 employees (including officers) and non-employee directors would have been eligible to purchase common stock and to receive awards under the 2010 Plan. 
Administration 
The 2010 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Subject to the limitations set forth in the plan, the Compensation Committee has the authority to determine, among other things, to whom awards will be granted, the number of shares subject to awards, the term during which an option or stock appreciation right may be exercised and the rate at which the awards may vest or be earned, including any performance criteria to which they may be subject. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to determine the consideration and methodology of payment for awards. The Board has created a secondary committee, the Non-Management Stock Option Committee, which is authorized to make awards and grants under the 2010 Plan to eligible individuals other than members of the Board, the "Section 16 officers," and employees who hold the title of Senior Vice President or above. 
Maximum Shares and Award Limits 
A total of 36,753,475 shares of common stock are currently reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan. As of March 12, 2019, the Company had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 13,435,299 shares of common stock (with exercise prices ranging from $12.46 to $138.52 per share) under the 2010 Plan, outstanding RSUs covering 1,494,294 shares, and outstanding performance shares pursuant to which a maximum of 480,495 shares could be issued and had 4,932,837 shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2010 Plan (or 12,632,837 shares of common stock including the 7,700,000 shares subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting). As of March 12, 2019, the Company had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 13,435,299 shares of common stock under the 2010 Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $76.72 per share and with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.73 years. The 2010 Plan replaced the 1991 Stock Plan and the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan. Shares that are subject to awards that expire, terminate or are cancelled under either the 1991 Stock Plan or the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan will not be made available for future awards under the 2010 Plan. Other than outstanding options to purchase common stock under the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan and the 2010 Plan, outstanding RSUs and performance shares under the 2010 Plan, and 66,666 outstanding RSUs granted outside of the 2010 Plan to Hervé Hoppenot, the Company had no other outstanding awards as of March 12, 2019, and no shares remain available for future issuance under either the 1991 Stock Plan or the 1993 Directors' Stock Option Plan. No one award recipient may receive awards under the 2010 Plan in any calendar year that relate to more than 800,000 shares of common stock. If the proposed amendments are approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, each "full value" award such as an award of RSUs, restricted shares or performance shares (that is, any sales or awards of shares other than upon exercise of options or other than pursuant to sales at purchase prices at least equal to the fair market value of the shares) will reduce the total share pool available under the 2010 Plan by 2.0 shares, and each stock option and any other non-full value award will reduce the total share pool by 1.0 share for each underlying award share granted. In addition, other than automatic grants to outside directors, awards for no more than 5% of the total number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2010 Plan may vest sooner than 12 months from the date of grant. 
These limitations shall be adjusted as appropriate and equitable in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reclassification of stock or similar events. If an award made under the 2010 Plan expires without having been exercised in full, or if any restricted shares, RSUs or performance shares are forfeited or repurchased by Company due to failure to vest, then the corresponding shares will again become available for awards under the 2010 Plan. Upon the settlement of stock appreciation rights, all of the shares subject to any such stock appreciation right will reduce the number of shares available under the 2010 Plan, regardless of the number of shares actually issued. If any award is paid in cash rather than shares of common stock, the payment of cash will not reduce the number of available shares. The Company may grant awards under other plans or programs, which may be settled in shares of common stock issued under the 2010 Plan. Such shares shall be treated like shares issued in settlement of RSUs and, when issued, will reduce the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2010 Plan. 
Stock Options 
The terms of any grants of stock options under the 2010 Plan will be set forth in a stock option agreement to be entered into between the Company and the recipient. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions of such option grants, which need not be identical. Stock options may provide for the accelerated exercisability in the event of the award recipient's death, disability, or retirement or other events and may provide for expiration prior to the end of its term in the event of the termination of the award recipient's service. The Compensation Committee may modify, extend or assume outstanding options or may accept the cancellation of outstanding options in return for the grant of new options for the same or a different number of shares and at the same or a different exercise price, or in return for the grant of the same or a different number of shares. However, outstanding options may not be modified to lower the exercise price, nor may outstanding options be assumed or accepted for cancellation in return for the grant of new options with a lower exercise price, unless approved by the Company's stockholders. In no event will the Company purchase or assume in exchange for cash any stock option whose exercise price exceeds the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock. 
The exercise price of each option will be set by the Compensation Committee, subject to the following limits. The exercise price of an incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted, and in the event an option recipient is deemed to be a 10% owner of our Company or one of our subsidiaries, the exercise price of an incentive stock option cannot be less than 110% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted. The exercise price of a nonstatutory stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted. On March 12, 2019, the closing price for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market was $84.90. The maximum period in which an option may be exercised will be fixed by the Compensation Committee and included in each stock option agreement but cannot exceed ten years in the case of an incentive stock option, and in the event an option recipient is deemed to be a 10% owner of our Company or one of our subsidiaries, the maximum period for an incentive stock option granted to that person cannot exceed five years. In addition, no option recipient may be granted incentive stock options that are exercisable for the first time in any calendar year for common stock having a total fair market value (determined as of the option grant) in excess of $100,000. 
The exercise price for the exercise of a stock option may be paid in cash or, to the extent that the stock option agreement so provides, by surrendering shares of common stock, by delivery of an irrevocable direction to a securities broker to sell shares and to deliver all or part of the sale proceeds to the Company in payment of the aggregate exercise price, by delivery of an irrevocable direction to a securities broker or lender to pledge shares, as security for a loan, and to deliver all or part of the loan proceeds to the Company in payment of the aggregate exercise price, by delivering a full-recourse promissory note, or in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations and rules. Options generally will be nontransferable except in the event of the option recipient's death. 
Stock options granted under the 2010 Plan must be exercised by the optionee before the expiration of such option. Each stock option agreement will set forth the extent to which the option recipient will have the right to exercise the option following the termination of the recipient's service with us, and the right to exercise the option of any executors or administrators of the award recipient's estate or any person who has acquired such options directly from the award recipient by bequest or inheritance. 
Automatic Option Grants to Directors 
As discussed above under "Description of Amendments," if the proposed amendments are approved by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the initial grants of 25,000 options to new nonemployee "outside" directors would be eliminated, and the annual grants made to outside directors following the conclusion of the Annual Meeting and each future annual meeting of our stockholders would be changed from a grant of 15,000 options to a grant consisting of 75% nonstatutory options and 25% RSUs having an aggregate grant date fair value of $500,000. The number of shares subject to the nonstatutory options will be determined by dividing 75% of $500,000 (or $375,000) by the Black-Scholes value of one such option, based on the average closing sale price for our shares on The Nasdaq Global Select Market over the 30 consecutive trading days concluding with the last trading day prior to the grant date, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The number of shares subject to the RSUs will be determined by dividing 25% of $500,000 (or $125,000) by such 30 trading day average price, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The exercise price of the options will be equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant, and the options will have a term of ten years. Each outside director who is not initially elected at a regular annual meeting of our stockholders will receive awards within 10 business days of his or her election having an aggregate grant date fair value of a pro rata portion of $500,000, determined based on the number of full calendar months remaining from the date of election until the next regular annual meeting divided by 12. Such outside director's awards will consist of 75% nonstatutory options and 25% RSUs determined in a manner similar to that used for the annual awards to outside directors following the conclusion of the regular annual meeting, except that the values of the awards to such outside director will be determined as of the grant date of such awards. All annual awards to outside directors will vest (and in the case of options, become exercisable) on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or immediately prior to the next regular annual meeting of our stockholders. 
Options granted to outside directors will become fully vested if a change in control occurs with respect to the Company during the director's service. The Board may from time to time increase the number of shares subject to an annual grant if the Board determines that the increase is necessary to induce individuals to become or remain non-employee directors, or to address an increase in the duties or responsibilities of a non-employee director. The Board may also determine that the exercise price of such an option shall be greater than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and that the option shall be exercisable on a different schedule than stated above. 
Restricted Shares 
The terms of any awards of restricted shares under the 2010 Plan will be set forth in a restricted share agreement to be entered into between the Company and the recipient. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions of the restricted share agreements, which need not be identical. Restricted share awards generally will be subject to vesting requirements of a minimum period of three years, and may be subject to transfer restrictions. Award recipients who are granted restricted shares generally have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to those shares. Restricted shares may be issued for consideration as the Compensation Committee may determine, including cash, cash equivalents, full-recourse promissory notes, past services and future services. 
Restricted Stock Units 
The terms of any awards of RSUs under the 2010 Plan will be set forth in an RSU agreement to be entered into between the Company and the recipient. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions of the RSU agreements, which need not be identical. RSUs give an award recipient the right to acquire a specified number of shares of common stock, or at the Compensation Committee's discretion, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at a future date upon the satisfaction of certain vesting conditions based upon a vesting schedule or performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee. RSUs generally will be subject to vesting requirements of a minimum period of three years. RSUs may be granted in consideration of a reduction in the award recipient's other compensation, but no cash consideration is required of the award recipient. Unlike restricted shares, the stock underlying RSUs will not be issued until the stock units have vested, and recipients of RSUs generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time of issuance of any common stock upon settlement. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
The terms of any awards of stock appreciation rights under the 2010 Plan will be set forth in an agreement to be entered into between the Company and the recipient. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms, conditions and restrictions of any such agreements, which need not be identical. A stock appreciation right generally entitles the award recipient to receive a payment upon exercise equal to the amount by which the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock appreciation right cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the stock appreciation right is granted. The amount payable upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right may be settled in cash or by the issuance of shares of common stock. 
Performance Shares 
The terms of any awards of performance shares under the 2010 Plan will be set forth in an agreement to be entered into between the Company and the recipient. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms, conditions and restrictions of any such agreements, which need not be identical. 
Performance shares give an award recipient the right to acquire a specified number of shares of common stock, or at the Compensation Committee's discretion, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at a future date, based on performance criteria set forth in the performance share agreement. The actual number of performance shares eligible for settlement may be larger or smaller than the number included in the original award, based on the performance criteria. Performance shares may be granted in consideration of a reduction in the award recipient's other compensation, but no cash consideration is required of the award recipient. An award of performance shares generally will vest only if the award recipient performs services for the entire performance period (or if less, one year). Recipients of performance shares generally will have no voting or dividend rights prior to the time of issuance of any common stock upon settlement. 
Qualifying Performance Criteria 
The 2010 Plan sets forth performance criteria that may be used in the case of performance shares and certain other awards intended to qualify for the "performance-based compensation" exemption from the corporate deduction limit under Section 162(m) of the Code. The "performance-based compensation" exemption has been repealed effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to certain transition rules for previously granted awards, as described below under "Certain Federal Income Tax Aspects of Awards Under the Plan—Code Section 162(m)." The Compensation Committee may, but is not required to, apply the performance criteria set forth in the 2010 Plan to performance shares and other awards granted in 2019 and future years. 
To qualify as a "performance-based compensation," the number of shares or other benefits granted, issued, retainable or vested under an award may be made subject to the attainment of performance goals for a specified period of time relating to one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either us as a whole or to a business unit or subsidiary, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years' or quarter's results or to the performance of one or more comparable companies or a designated comparison group or index, in each case as specified by the Compensation Committee in the award: (a) cash flow (including operating cash flow), (b) earnings per share, (c) earnings before any combination of interest, taxes, depreciation, or amortization, (d) return on equity, (e) total stockholder return, (f) share price performance, (g) return on capital, (h) return on assets or net assets, (i) revenue, (j) income or net income, (k) operating income or net operating income, (l) operating profit or net operating profit, (m) operating margin or profit margin (including as a percentage of revenue), (n) return on operating revenue, (o) return on invested capital, (p) market segment shares, (q) economic profit, (r) achievement of target levels of discovery and/or development of products, including but not limited to regulatory achievements, (s) achievement of research and development objectives, and (t) formation of joint ventures, strategic relationships or other commercial, research or development collaborations. The Compensation Committee may appropriately adjust any evaluation of performance under a qualifying performance criteria to exclude any of the following events that occur during a performance period: (i) asset write-downs, (ii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (iii) the effect of changes in tax law, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, (iv) accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs and (v) any extraordinary, nonrecurring items disclosed in the Company's financial statements or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in our annual report to stockholders for the applicable year. If applicable, the Compensation Committee will determine the qualifying performance criteria and any permitted exclusions for events described in the preceding sentence not later than the 90th day of the performance period, and will determine and certify the extent to which the qualifying performance criteria have been met. For awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee may not in any event increase the amount of compensation payable under the 2010 Plan upon the attainment of qualifying performance criteria to an award recipient who is a "covered employee" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
Amendment and Termination 
No awards may be granted under the 2010 Plan, as amended, after March 18, 2021 or, if the proposed amendments are approved by stockholders, after June 30, 2021. The Board may amend or terminate the 2010 Plan at any time, but an amendment will not become effective without the approval of the Company's stockholders to the extent required by applicable laws, regulations or rules. No amendment or termination of the 2010 Plan will affect an award recipient's rights under outstanding awards without the award recipient's consent. 
Effect of Certain Corporate Events 
In the event of a subdivision of the outstanding common stock or a combination or consolidation of the outstanding common stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, or declaration of a dividend payable in common stock or, if in an amount that has a material effect on the price of the shares, in cash, the Compensation Committee will make appropriate adjustments in the number of shares covered by outstanding awards and the exercise price of outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, and the number of shares available under the 2010 Plan. 
In the event of a merger or other reorganization, subject to any acceleration provisions in the agreement relating to an award, outstanding awards will be treated in the manner provided in the agreement of merger or reorganization. That agreement may provide for the assumption of outstanding awards by the surviving corporation or its parent, for their continuation by the Company (if the Company is the surviving corporation), for the substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of its own awards, or for the acceleration of the exercisability of awards followed by the cancellation of those awards. The agreement of merger or reorganization may also provide for the cancellation of outstanding awards, with a payment of the value of those awards (without regard as to whether those awards have vested or are exercisable) as of the closing date of the merger or reorganization. In such an event, the payment may be in cash or securities, be paid in installments, be deferred until the underlying award would have vested, become exercisable or settled under the agreement relating to the award, and may be subject to vesting and performance criteria no less favorable to the recipient than under the agreement relating to the award, in all cases without the recipients' consent. 
Certain Federal Income Tax Aspects of Awards Under the Plan 
This is a brief summary of the federal income tax aspects of awards that may be made under the 2010 Plan based on existing U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary provides only the basic tax rules. It does not describe a number of special tax rules, including the alternative minimum tax and various elections that may be applicable under certain circumstances. It also does not reflect provisions of the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which a holder may reside, nor does it reflect the tax consequences of a holder's death. The tax consequences of awards under 2010 Plan depend upon the type of award and, if the award is to an executive officer, whether compensation paid to the officer is subject to the tax deduction limit imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code. 
Incentive Stock Options 
The recipient of an incentive stock option generally will not be taxed upon grant of the option. Federal income taxes are generally imposed only when the shares of common stock from exercised incentive stock options are disposed of, by sale or otherwise. The amount by which the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise exceeds the exercise price is, however, included in determining the option recipient's liability for the alternative minimum tax. If the incentive stock option recipient does not sell or dispose of the shares of common stock until more than one year after the receipt of the shares and two years after the option was granted, then, upon sale or disposition of the shares, the difference between the exercise price and the market value of the shares of common stock as of the date of exercise will be treated as a capital gain, and not ordinary income. If a recipient fails to hold the shares for the minimum required time the recipient will recognize ordinary income in the year of disposition generally in an amount equal to any excess of the market value of the common stock on the date of exercise (or, if less, the amount realized or disposition of the shares) over the exercise price paid for the shares. Any further gain (or loss) realized by the recipient generally will be taxed as short-term or long-term gain (or loss) depending on the holding period. We will generally be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and in the same amount as ordinary income is recognized by the option recipient. 
Nonstatutory Stock Options 
The recipient of stock options not qualifying as incentive stock options generally will not be taxed upon the grant of the option. Federal income taxes are generally due from a recipient of nonstatutory stock options when the stock options are exercised. The excess of the fair market value of the common stock purchased on such date over the exercise price of the option is taxed as ordinary income. Thereafter, the tax basis for the acquired shares is equal to the amount paid for the shares plus the amount of ordinary income recognized by the recipient. We will generally be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and in the same amount as ordinary income is recognized by the option recipient by reason of the exercise of the option. 
Other Awards 
Recipients who receive RSU awards will generally recognize ordinary income when they receive shares upon settlement of the awards, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at that time. Recipients who receive awards of restricted shares subject to a vesting requirement will generally recognize ordinary income at the time vesting occurs, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at that time minus the amount, if any, paid for the shares. However, a recipient who receives restricted shares which are not vested may, within 30 days of the date the shares are transferred, elect in accordance with Section 83(b) of the Code to recognize ordinary compensation income at the time of transfer of the shares rather than upon the vesting dates. Recipients who receive stock appreciation rights will generally recognize ordinary income upon exercise in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the exercise date and cash received, if any, over the exercise price. Recipients who receive performance shares will generally recognize ordinary income at the time of settlement, in an amount equal to the cash received, if any, and the fair market value of any shares received. We will generally be entitled to a tax deduction at the same time and in the same amount as ordinary income is recognized by the recipient. 
Code Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to us for annual compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain executive officers. Prior to 2018, however, we could deduct compensation above $1,000,000 if it was "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). Stock options and performance shares granted prior to 2018 were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation. The approval of our amended and restated 2010 Plan by our stockholders in 2013 satisfied one of the requirements for the performance-based compensation exemption. 
The Section 162(m) exemption for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to a transition rule for amounts payable pursuant to written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. We believe that outstanding stock options granted prior to November 2, 2017 qualify for this transition rule, and thus retain their status as deductible performance-based compensation. 
New Plan Benefits 
The Compensation Committee has not made any determination with respect to future awards under the 2010 Plan and, except for automatic grants to non-employee "outside" directors, awards and the terms of any awards under the plan for the current year or any future year are not determinable. As described above, the 2010 Plan provides for the automatic grant of awards to outside directors. If stockholders approve the proposed amendments to the 2010 Plan, each outside director nominee who will continue to serve as a member of the Board will receive a grant consisting of 75% nonstatutory options and 25% RSUs having an aggregate grant date fair value of $500,000. 
Required Vote 
Approval of the amendments to the 2010 Plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote.

Proposal 4 
Ratification of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, subject to reconsideration by the Audit Committee should our stockholders fail to ratify such appointment at the Annual Meeting or should the Audit Committee not approve Ernst & Young LLP's audit plan for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has audited our financial statements since the Company's inception in 1991. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed by Ernst & Young LLP for audit and other services rendered.

 Audit-related Fees(2)     —          75   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees include fees billed for the audit of the Company's annual statements and reviews of the Company's  quarterly financial statements, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and include fees for SEC registration  statements and consultation on accounting standards or transactions.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of the services other than the audit services is compatible with maintaining Ernst & Young LLP's independence. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. All of the services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved. 
Required Vote 
Ratification will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote. Stockholder ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise. However, the 
 Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

            The Board  recommends a vote "FOR" Ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting.

Proposal 5 
Stockholder Proposal 
Proposal 5 set forth below was submitted to the Company by Dundas I. Flaherty and Sandra J. Kulli, of 3749 Malibu Vista Drive, Malibu, California 90265. Mr. Flaherty and Ms. Kulli state that, as of November 13, 2018, they own in the aggregate 110,120 shares of our common stock and that they intend to hold those shares until after the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting. Mr. Flaherty's and Ms. Kulli's proposal is printed below verbatim. The Company is not responsible for the contents of this proposal or the supporting statement of Mr. Flaherty and Ms. Kulli. Mr. Flaherty and Ms. Kulli have advised the Company that they intend to present the proposal at our Annual Meeting. Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST the proposal for the reasons set forth following the proposal. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL FOR AN INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIR 
RESOLVED: Stockholders of Incyte Corporation urge the Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to adopt a policy, with amendments to governing documents as needed, so that, to the extent feasible, the Chairman of the Board shall be an independent director who has not previously served as an executive officer of the Company. The policy should be implemented so as not to violate any contractual obligations and should specify the process for selecting a new independent chairman if the Chairman ceases to be independent between annual meetings of shareholders or if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
Our CEO currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In our view, the Chairman should be an independent director, who has not previously served as an executive, in order to provide robust oversight and accountability of management, and to facilitate effective deliberation of corporate strategy, which we believe, is difficult to accomplish when the CEO also serves as chairman. Even with robust responsibilities, we believe the position of a lead independent director is inadequate to this task because ultimate responsibility for board leadership remains with the chairman/CEO. 
We believe that these considerations are particularly compelling at this time. Approximately five years ago, the company essentially operated as a biotechnology startup with one FDA-approved product, ruxolitinib, with other product possibilities based primarily on related small-molecule medicinal chemistry science. 
Since then, Incyte has successfully pursued the commercial potential of ruxolitinib, with excellent sales growth, run clinical trials demonstrating benefit in treating several diseases besides myelofibrosis, and received FDA approval for additional indications. 
However, Incyte has enjoyed less success with other products. The Company had high hopes for epacadostat, a novel molecule thought to synergize with anti-cancer breakthroughs such as Keytruda and Opdivo, and baricitinib, for rheumatoid arthritis partnered with Eli Lilly and Company. 
Neither product succeeded as previewed. Incyte stopped late-stage clinical trials of epacadostat in April 2018, citing lack of efficacy, and has not announced plans to continue developing it. Baricitinib, once believed by securities analysts to have high potential, is now not expected to achieve such potential, after delays and difficulties with FDA approval and safety concerns. 
Despite success with ruxolitinib, Incyte's stock today is about half its value when hopes for epacadostat were high. Indeed, as of late 2018, the stock price was approximately the same as it was five years ago. 
In our view, Incyte's general lack of success with new products since 2014 argues in favor of adding board leadership to challenge management on its plans and strategy, particularly. Separating the roles of Chairman and CEO can help better align the Board's interests with shareholders' interests and improve Board-management dialogues on successful new products to help make Incyte an outstanding performer. 
We urge you to vote FOR this proposal. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO PROPOSAL 5 
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 5. The Board has considered Proposal 5, and, for the reasons described below, believes that the proposal is not in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. 
Summary. Our Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance. Our current leadership structure and governing documents permit the roles of Chairman and CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals. Where the Chairman and CEO roles are filled by the same individual, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the independent directors on our Board to appoint a Lead Independent Director. 
The Board values its flexibility to select, from time to time, a leadership structure that it believes is most able to serve our Company's and stockholders' best interests based on the qualifications of individuals available and circumstances existing at the time. As such, the Board periodically evaluates whether combining or separating the roles of Chairman and CEO is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. 
Currently, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to have Hervé Hoppenot, our President and CEO, serve as Chairman, coupled with Julian C. Baker — a managing member of the general partner of our largest stockholder (Baker Bros. Advisors LP and affiliated entities (the "Baker Funds")) — serving as our Lead Independent Director. Previously, however, the Board had separated the Chairman and CEO roles, including during the beginning of Mr. Hoppenot's tenure as CEO. The Board retains the authority to modify this structure as it deems appropriate. 
The Board believes that a policy limiting its flexibility to choose, consistent with its fiduciary duties, a leadership structure that in the Board's view enables our Company to most effectively execute its strategy and business plans to maximize stockholder value is not only unnecessary but would also be detrimental to our Company and our stockholders. 
Board Commitment to Independence. The Board maintains a strong commitment to ensuring Board independence so that it is able to maintain effective oversight of management. The Board's commitment to independence includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Annual appointment of a strong Lead Independent Director, who also currently represents our largest stockholder, the  Baker Funds, thereby ensuring strong representation of stockholder interests  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Robust duties of the Lead Independent Director, which include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the  independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serving as liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the other independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  -  Mr. Baker is actively involved with our Company and devotes a significant amount of his time and energy to  fulfilling his responsibilities as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Baker meets regularly, and works closely with, our Chairman and CEO and other senior members of management; also, he facilitates communication among the independent directors on  our Board and speaks regularly with each independent director, promoting the candid exchange of ideas among Board members  
[END TABLE]

  ✓  Corporate Governance Guidelines providing that the Board may have access to Company management and employees and its own  advisors, at the Boards discretion.  
[END TABLE]
Benefits of Current Combined Leadership Structure. The Board believes that the Company and our stockholders have been best served by having Mr. Hoppenot in the role of Chairman and CEO and Mr. Baker as Lead Independent Director for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Unique Knowledge of our Business. Mr. Hoppenot is most familiar with our business, our management and  employees, and the unique near-and longer-term challenges we face. Because of his knowledge and extensive experience regarding our operations, the highly-regulated  biopharmaceutical industry and the markets around the world in which we compete, Mr. Hoppenot is the director best suited to identify strategic opportunities and focus the activities of the Board. Mr. Hoppenots day-to-day insight into our challenges and opportunities facilitates a timely deliberation by the Board of important matters.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Accountability to All Stakeholders. As Chairman and CEO, Mr. Hoppenot uniquely has accountability to the  Board, to stockholders and to the employees that help every day to make our Company a successful company. Whether our Company faces successes or failure, Mr. Hoppenot is the person who must face the Board to account for our Companys  actions, who must face the employees who put their trust in him and our Company and, most importantly, the stockholders who own our Company. In fact, in 2018, Mr. Hoppenot presented directly to stockholders, analysts and the  public over 20 times through presentations at regular and frequent investor conferences, through quarterly earnings conference calls with extensive question-and-answer  sessions, and through individual and small-group stockholder meetings. Mr. Hoppenot serves as an important bridge between the Board and management and provides critical leadership for carrying out our strategic initiatives and confronting  our challenges. Through his extensive and frequent engagement with stockholders, Mr. Hoppenot is in the best position to have a deep understanding of the concerns of the owners of our Company and is in the best position to ensure those concerns  are communicated to, and deliberated on by, our Board on a regular basis. The Board believes that Mr. Hoppenot brings a unique, stockholder-focused insight to assist our Company to most effectively  execute its strategy and business plans to maximize stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Effective Action on Stockholder Feedback. The substantial and sustained engagement with our stockholders by  Mr. Hoppenot  as our Chairman and CEO  and Mr. Baker  as our Lead Independent Director  and their collective and detailed knowledge of stockholder concerns have ensured that stockholder interests in significant  governance and compensation enhancements are brought before the Board in a meaningful and timely way. The significant governance and compensation changes enacted following and in response to stockholder feedback in recent years are detailed above in  this proxy statement under Stockholder Engagement, starting on page 6, and include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    Aligning the compensation of our Board of Directors to that of our peers  
  ○    Enhancing pay-for-performance by using  performance-based shares in executive compensation  
  ○    Requiring majority voting for directors in uncontested elections  
  ○    Adopting a 3-year cash clawback policy for executives  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    Requiring that all directors and executive officers hold a minimum amount of Incyte equity  
  ○    Imposing a 12-month minimum vesting period for employee equity awards generally   
  ○    Eliminating tax gross-ups on perquisites  
  ○    Prohibiting hedging transactions in Incyte stock by directors and officers  
  ○    Increasing transparency in our discussion of compensation practices and our corporate goals  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Our Board is Stronger and More Effective. The current leadership structure provides the Board with more complete  and timely information about our Company, a unified structure and consistent leadership direction internally and externally, and provides a collaborative environment for Board decision-making. The strength and  effectiveness of the communications between Mr. Hoppenot as our Chairman and Mr. Baker as our Lead Independent Director result in effective Board oversight of the issues, plans and prospects of our Company.  
[END TABLE]
Strategic Flexibility Helps Maintain Competitive Position with Our Peers. Our Board currently believes it is in the best interest of the stockholders that Mr. Hoppenot act as Chairman and CEO. As stated above, the Board has separated the Chairman and CEO roles in the past. The Board considers its leadership structure every year. In the future, circumstances may lead the Board to believe that separating the roles is in the best interests of our stockholders at that time. The proposed requirement of Proposal 5 that the Chairman and CEO roles must be separated would restrict your Board from doing what it thinks is in your best interests at any given time. Of the 16 companies in our current executive compensation peer group, 75% provide their boards with the strategic flexibility to structure their leadership as they believe to be in the best interests of their respective stockholders. The strategic inflexibility proposed by Proposal 5 would force us into a competitive disadvantage against the nimble peer companies with whom we compete. 
Conclusion and Recommendation AGAINST Proposal 5. The strong leadership role of the Board's independent directors in the oversight of our Company is evident from the independent composition of the Board aside from our CEO, the exclusively independent composition of the Board's Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, and the functioning of the Board's independent directors and Lead Independent Director, who is also a principal in the general partner of the Baker Funds, our largest stockholder. It is important that the Board continues to be able to assess all relevant facts and circumstances, in fulfilment of its fiduciary duty, to determine the leadership structure that is best suited to meet the needs of our Company at any given time. Accordingly, the Board believes that adoption of a fixed policy requiring an independent Chairman is not in the best interests of stockholders.

Under the securities laws of the United States, our directors, executive officers and any persons holding more than 10% of our common stock are required to report their initial ownership of our common stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Specific due dates for these reports have been established and we are required to identify in this Proxy Statement those persons who failed to timely file these reports.

These proposals also must comply with the proxy proposal submission rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 14a-8.

If an Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full,  or, with respect to Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares, is forfeited to or repurchased by the Corporation due to failure to vest, the unpurchased Shares (or for Awards other than Options or SARs the forfeited or  repurchased Shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). With respect to SARs, when a stock settled SAR is exercised, all of the Shares subject to the SAR shall be  counted against the number of Shares available for future grant or sale under the Plan, regardless of the number of Shares actually issued pursuant to such exercise. Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be  returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if Shares issued pursuant to Awards of Restricted Shares, Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares are repurchased  by the Corporation or are forfeited to the Corporation, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan.

A Restricted Share  Agreement may provide for accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant's death, Total and Permanent Disability or retirement or other events. The Committee may determine, at the time of granting Restricted Shares or thereafter, that all  or part of such Restricted Shares shall become vested upon a Change in Control. Except as may be set forth in a Restricted Share Agreement, vesting of the Restricted Shares shall cease on the termination of the Participant's Service.

  (d)  Voting and Dividend Rights. The holders of Restricted Shares awarded under the Plan shall have the same  voting, dividend and other rights as the Corporation's other stockholders.

The Stock Option Agreement shall also specify the term of the  Option; provided, however, that the term of an ISO shall in no event exceed 10 years from the date of grant (five years for Employees described in Section 4(b)). A Stock Option Agreement may provide for accelerated exercisability  in the event of the Optionee's death, Total and Permanent Disability or retirement or other events and may provide for expiration prior to the end of its term in the event of the termination of the Optionee's Service. Options may be  awarded in combination with SARs, and such an Award may provide that the Options will not be exercisable unless the related SARs are forfeited. Subject to the foregoing in this Section 7(e), the Committee at its sole discretion shall determine  when all or any installment of an Option is to become exercisable and when an Option is to expire.

  (b)  Surrender of Stock.

The number of Shares may be fixed or may vary in accordance with such Qualifying Performance Criteria as may be determined by the Committee. A Performance Share Agreement may provide for  accelerated vesting in the event of the Participant's death, Total and Permanent Disability or retirement or other events.

  (a)  Annual Grants. On the first business day following the conclusion of each regular annual meeting of the  Corporation's stockholders beginning with the 2019 annual meeting, each Outside Director who will continue serving as a member of the Board of Directors thereafter shall receive Awards having an aggregate grant date fair value of $500,000, of  which 75% shall be Nonstatutory Options and 25% shall be Restricted Stock Units. The number of Shares subject to such Nonstatutory Options shall be determined by dividing 75% of $500,000 (or $375,000) by the Black-Scholes value of one such Option,  based on the average closing sale price for the Stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (or such other United States stock exchange or over-the-counter market on which  the Stock is then traded) over the 30 consecutive trading days concluding with the last trading day prior to the grant date, rounded down to the nearest whole Share. The number of Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Units shall be determined by  dividing 25% of $500,000 (or $125,000) by such 30 trading day average price, rounded down to the nearest whole Share. Each Outside Director who is not initially elected at a regular annual meeting of the Corporation's stockholders in 2019 or a  subsequent year shall receive Awards within 10 business days of his or her election having an aggregate grant date fair value of a pro rata portion of $500,000, such pro rata portion to be determined based on the number of full calendar months  remaining from the date of election until the next regular annual meeting of the Corporation's stockholders divided by 12. Such Outside Director's Awards shall consist of 75% Nonstatutory Options and 25% Restricted Stock Units determined  in a manner similar to that used for the annual Awards to
