Executive Summary
Our Strategic Imperatives and 2018 Performance
2018 was a strong year for American Express. We continued the positive momentum from 2017 with broad-based growth across all business lines, anchored in our focus on and investment in the Company's four strategic imperatives:
Business Performance
As our 2018 results show, our investments and strategy for winning in the marketplace are paying off. Our integrated payments model and our unique assets have helped us gain share and scale, which we believe drive sustainable growth. Business performance highlights in 2018 include:

How our Compensation Program Supports our Business Strategy
Our compensation program supports our business strategy through program design as well as aggressive financial and business growth goals. As a result, our compensation programs are closely aligned with Company performance and are sensitive to the Company's stock performance. Most senior executives' compensation is variable and covers annual and multi-year performance periods. For example, our Long-Term Incentive Award is granted in two forms: performance shares (80% of award) and stock options (20% of award). Each of these incentives aligns executives'  interests with those of shareholders, including through the use of multi-year, performance-based vesting periods.
Our compensation program, including our executive compensation principles and strategy, is discussed in detail under the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.
Say on Pay, Shareholder Engagement and Feedback
We actively seek feedback from our shareholders and other stakeholders throughout the year. In 2018, we met with shareholders representing approximately half of our outstanding shares to discuss executive compensation, corporate governance and related matters. In order to establish a direct line of communication between shareholders and our Board, our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Williams, actively participated in several of these meetings. In light of the disappointing level of support for our 2018 say on pay vote (69.9%), we sought detailed input from shareholders and other stakeholders regarding specific aspects of our compensation programs and certain investor suggestions for program enhancement were
Table of Contents discussed with the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the Board of Directors (Board). The Compensation and Benefits Committee approved a number of changes to our compensation program considering this feedback, including the elimination of our Portfolio Grant (long-term cash) program and adding relative measures to our performance share program.
Our shareholder engagement and response to shareholder feedback are discussed in detail under the Shareholder Engagement and Compensation Discussion and Analysis sections of this proxy statement.
Our Board of Directors
We believe that our Board has assembled the right mix of members to provide effective oversight and insightful strategic guidance. We continually review our Board's composition to identify the skills needed for our Company both in the near term and into the future.

Our Retiring Directors
Richard C. Levin and Samuel J. Palmisano are retiring from our Board at the end of their current terms and, therefore, will not stand for reelection at our annual meeting. We thank Rick and Sam for their dedicated service and wish each of them continued success.
Our Board's Composition
As illustrated by the above director biographies, our Board is made up of a diverse group of leaders with substantial experience in their respective fields. Ongoing board succession planning along with our mandatory retirement age for directors, assures that the Board continues to maintain an appropriate mix of objectivity, skills and experiences to provide fresh perspectives and effective oversight and guidance to management, while leveraging the institutional knowledge and historical perspective of our longer-tenured directors.
The Nominating and Governance Committee assesses potential candidates based on their history of achievement, the breadth of their business experiences, whether they also bring specific skills or expertise in areas that the committee has identified as desired and whether they possess personal attributes and diverse experiences that will contribute to the effective functioning of the Board. While we do not have a specific policy on board diversity, our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the Board should be diverse, engaged and independent. When reviewing potential board nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the diversity of the Board, including gender and race, and does not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity, sexual orientation, culture or nationality.
Attributes of Director Nominees: What We Look For
Process for Identifying and Adding New Directors
The Nominating and Governance Committee uses a professional search firm to help identify, evaluate and conduct due diligence on potential director candidates. Using a search firm allows the committee to make sure it is conducting a broad search and looking at a diverse pool of potential candidates. The committee also maintains an ongoing list of potential candidates.
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers all shareholder recommendations for director candidates and applies the same standards in considering candidates submitted by shareholders as it does in evaluating all other candidates. Shareholders can recommend candidates by writing to the committee in care of the Company's Corporate Secretary, whose contact information is on page 30. Shareholders who wish to submit nominees for election at an annual or special meeting of shareholders should follow the procedure described on page 95.

Our Board Evaluation Process
Our Board continually seeks to improve its performance. Throughout the year our Lead Independent Director has regular one-on-one discussions with our Board members and conveys their feedback on an ongoing basis to our Chairman. Separately, our Chairman, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary each routinely communicate with our Board members to obtain real-time feedback.
Our Nominating and Governance Committee oversees the formal annual evaluation process of the effectiveness of our Board and its standing committees. Conducting a robust annual evaluation allows the Board to assess its performance and practices and identify areas for improvement. As part of the evaluation process, our Board analyzes and assesses the performance of both the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director, as well as the overall leadership structure of the Company.
We believe that this continuous feedback cycle along with our formal annual evaluation process helps to ensure the continued effectiveness of our Board.

Our Board Leadership Structure
We believe that strong independent leadership is essential for our Board to effectively perform its primary oversight functions.
Our Board is led by a combination of Mr. Williams, our Lead Independent Director, and Mr. Squeri, our Chairman and CEO, supplemented by engaged committee chairs and independent-minded, skilled and committed directors. Messrs. Squeri and Williams assumed their roles in February and March of 2018, respectively, and have forged a strong and productive working relationship. The Board's succession planning discussions surrounding their initial appointments included extensive discussions of the Board's leadership structure. Through that process, the Board determined that continuing with the combined Chairman and CEO structure, in combination with a strong Lead Independent Director, provides the best leadership structure for our Company and creates an environment in which the Board can work effectively and appropriately challenge management.
Our Board recently undertook its annual review of our leadership structure in conjunction with the Nominating and Governance Committee. This review included consideration of the sound and effective leadership provided by Mr. Williams during his tenure as Lead Independent Director as well as the tangible benefits of having a Chairman and CEO with an operational focus and extensive company experience given the global and complex nature of our business. Following thoughtful review and discussion, our Board continues to believe that our current leadership structure allows the Board to focus on key policy and operational issues, provides critical and effective leadership, both internally and externally, and benefits the long-term interests of our shareholders.
Strong Lead Independent Director with Defined Role and Responsibilities
The Board recognizes that in circumstances like ours where the positions of Chairman and CEO are combined, a strong Lead Independent Director with a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities is paramount for constructive and effective leadership.
Therefore, the position of Lead Independent Director at American Express comes with a clear mandate and significant authority and responsibilities which are detailed in our Board-approved Corporate Governance Principles.
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the Lead Independent Director will:

Our Board's Primary Role and Responsibilities, Structure and Processes
Our Board's Primary Role and Responsibilities
Our Board bears the responsibility for the oversight of management on behalf of our shareholders in order to ensure long-term value creation. In that regard, the primary responsibilities of our Board include (i) oversight of the Company's annual business plan and corporate strategy, (ii) ongoing succession planning and (iii) risk management.
How our Board Oversees our Annual Business Plan and Corporate Strategy
Our Board oversees our strategic direction and business activities. At the beginning of each year, our Chief Financial Officer presents our consolidated annual business plan to the Board, and the Board discusses the Company's results relative to the plan periodically throughout the year. Each year, the Board engages in a two-day offsite strategy meeting with management where it conducts a comprehensive review and discussion of the Company's strategic goals over the short-, medium- and long-term, as well as management's plans to achieve such goals. In addition, at least once a year, each of the global business groups presents an in-depth review of their business to the Board, which includes a review of the strategic goals of the business and business performance relative to the businesses strategy.
How our Board Engages in Ongoing CEO and Key Executive Succession Planning
Our Board ensures that we have the right management talent to pursue our strategies successfully.
The entire Board is involved in the critical aspects of the CEO succession planning process, including establishing selection criteria that reflect our business strategies, identifying and evaluating potential internal candidates and making key management succession decisions. Succession is regularly discussed with the CEO as well as without the CEO present in executive sessions of the Board. The Board makes sure that it has adequate opportunities to meet with and assess development plans for potential CEO successors to address identified gaps in skills and attributes. This occurs through various means, including informal meetings, Board dinners, presentations to the Board and committees, attendance at Board meetings and the comprehensive annual talent review. In addition, the Board has developed an emergency CEO succession plan.
The Board also oversees management's succession planning for other key executive positions. Our Board calendar includes at least one meeting each year at which the Board conducts a detailed talent review which includes a review of the Company's talent strategies, leadership pipeline and succession plans for key executive positions.
Additionally, the results of the Company's Annual Culture (Pulse) Survey are reviewed each year in detail with the Board. The insights provided by this survey help to ensure that the Company is developing future leaders who will positively impact Company culture. We believe that maintaining our strong culture and adhering to our Blue Box Values will ensure that we attract, retain and develop the right talent to lead the Company and successfully execute our corporate strategy.
How our Board Oversees Risk Management
We are committed to Board-level risk management. Our Board monitors our "tone at the top" and risk culture and oversees emerging strategic risks. Risk management is overseen by our Board through three Board committees: Risk, Audit and Compliance, and Compensation and Benefits. Each committee consists entirely of independent directors and provides regular reports to the Board regarding matters reviewed at their committee. The committees meet regularly in private executive sessions with our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, Chief Audit Executive and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent and capabilities.

Board Oversight of Information and Cyber Security
We are a global financial services company and understand the substantial operational risks for companies in our industry as well as the importance of preserving the trust of our customers and securing their personal information. To that end, we have an extensive cybersecurity governance framework in place. Our Board receives reports on cybersecurity at least once a year and our Risk Committee receives reports on cybersecurity at least twice a year, one of which is joint with the Audit and Compliance Committee, and all receive ad hoc updates as needed. In addition, the Risk Committee annually approves the Company's information security program.
We have a very experienced information security team and we actively develop and recruit leadership and specialists from both the government and private sector. We have implemented an Information Security Program and Operating Model that is designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction. Our Information Security Program and Operating Model are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Common Standards Framework, which consist of controls designed to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from information and cyber security incidents. The framework defines risks and associated controls which are embedded in our processes and technology. Those controls are measured and monitored by a combination of subject matter experts and a security operations center with our integrated cyber detection, response and recovery capabilities.
We continuously assess the risks and changes in the cyber environment and dynamically adjust our program and investments as required.
How our Management Oversees Risk
We use our comprehensive ERM program to identify, aggregate, monitor and manage risks. The program also defines our risk appetite, governance, culture and capabilities. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Officer.
There are several internal risk management committees, including the Enterprise-wide Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Officer. The ERMC is the highest-level management committee to oversee all firm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight and risk appetite. It maintains the enterprise-wide risk appetite framework and monitors compliance with limits and escalations defined in it. The ERMC oversees implementation of risk policies Company-wide. The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, significant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control and report major risks.
Our Board Committees
Our Board's current standing committee membership information is listed below. Standing committee membership for 2018 can be found in our 2018 proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 19, 2018.

Our Corporate Governance Framework
We have adopted Corporate Governance Principles that, together with the charters of the six standing committees of the Board (Audit and Compliance, Compensation and Benefits, Innovation and Technology, Nominating and Governance, Public Responsibility and Risk), our Code of Conduct (which constitutes our code of ethics for employees) and the Code of Business Conduct for Directors, provide our governance framework. Key governance policies and processes also include our whistleblower policy, our comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management program, our commitment to transparent financial reporting and our systems of internal checks and balances. Comprehensive management policies, many of which are approved at the board level, guide the Company's operations.
Our Board, along with management, regularly reviews our Corporate Governance Principles and practices to ensure that they are appropriate and reflect our high standards and Blue Box Values. In reviewing our Corporate Governance Principles and making recommendations, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the views of shareholders expressed to us in engagement meetings, as well as publicly available discourse on governance.
You may view the following documents by clicking on the "Corporate Governance" link found on our investor relations webpage at http://ir.americanexpress.com and then selecting "Governance Framework." You may also access our Investor Relations webpage through our main website at americanexpress.com by clicking on the "About American Express" link, which is located at the bottom of the Company's homepage. You may also obtain free copies of the following materials by writing to our Company's Corporate Secretary:
Majority Voting Standard for Director Elections
In a non-contested election, directors are elected by a majority of "for" votes cast by shareholders. (A non-contested election is an election where the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected.) If a director receives a greater number of votes "against" than votes "for" his or her election, the director is required to immediately submit his or her resignation to the Board. The Board, excluding such individual, will decide whether or not to accept such resignation and will promptly disclose and explain its decision in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In a contested election, the director nominees who receive the plurality of votes cast are elected as directors. Under the plurality standard, the number of persons equal to the number of vacancies to be filled who receive more votes than other nominees are elected to the Board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of votes cast. An election is considered contested under our certificate of incorporation if there are more nominees than positions on the Board to be filled at the meeting of shareholders as of the fourteenth day prior to the date on which we file our definitive proxy statement with the SEC.
Table of Contents
Proxy Access
A shareholder or group of no more than 20 shareholders that has owned at least 3% of our common shares for at least three years may nominate directors to our Board and include the nominees in our proxy materials to be voted on at our annual shareholder meeting. The maximum number of shareholder nominees that will be included in our proxy materials with respect to any such annual meeting is the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of directors to be elected. A shareholder who seeks to nominate a director or directors to our Board must provide proper notice to the Company's Corporate Secretary under the terms of our bylaws.
Director Attendance
During 2018, our Board met six times and our committees met 34 times (in the aggregate). All directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and Board committees on which they served in 2018.
All of our directors serving on our Board at the time of our 2018 annual meeting attended the meeting. Our Board strongly encourages all of its members to attend the annual meeting but understands there may be exigent circumstances.
Our meeting attendance policy is set forth in our Corporate Governance Principles.
Executive Sessions
Executive sessions of independent directors, led by our Lead Independent Director, enable the Board to discuss matters such as strategy, CEO and senior management performance and compensation, succession planning and board effectiveness without management present. Our independent directors meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled in-person board meeting. Any director may request additional executive sessions of independent directors. During 2018, our independent directors met in executive session at six board meetings.
Our Board's Size
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that while the Board need not adhere to a fixed number of directors, generally a board of 12—14 directors offers a sufficiently large and diverse group to address the important issues facing the Company and provide a wide range of perspectives while being small enough to encourage personal involvement and discussion.
Due to the retirements of Messrs. Levin and Palmisano, 11 of our directors are standing for re-election. We continue to believe that a board of 12-14 directors is the right size for our Company and plan to add new directors to our Board as candidates possessing the attributes we look for are identified.
Our Board's Independence
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that a substantial majority of our directors will meet the criteria for independence required by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A director is considered independent if the Board determines that he or she does not have a material relationship with the Company. In making its annual independence determinations, the Board considers transactions between each director nominee and the Company. Our Board has established guidelines to assist it in determining director independence. These guidelines can be found within our Corporate Governance Principles and cover, among other things, employment and compensatory relationships, relationships with our auditors, customer and business relationships, and contributions to nonprofit organizations.
Based on our guidelines, the Board determined in March 2019 that all of its members in 2018 other than Messrs. Chenault and Squeri, and all of the Board's director nominees for election at the 2019 annual meeting, other than Mr. Squeri, are independent.

Ambassador Barshefsky is a partner at the law firm of WilmerHale, an international law firm based in Washington, D.C. From time to time and in the ordinary course of its business, WilmerHale provides legal services to American Express that we consider to be de minimus in nature. Ambassador Barshefsky does not provide any such legal services, and she does not receive any compensation from the firm that is generated by or related to our payments to WilmerHale for such services. The Nominating and Governance Committee determined, based on fees paid to the firm over the past three years, that WilmerHale does not perform substantial legal services for the Company on a regular basis. The fees and expenses paid to WilmerHale represented less than 1% of the firm's annual revenue in each of the past three years and represented less than 0.1% of American Express' revenues in each such year. Further, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviewed the nature of American Express' engagement of WilmerHale and the services rendered, including the expertise and relevant experience of the firm and the specific partners engaged to work on the matters for which we have engaged the firm, and determined that Ambassador Barshefsky's service on American Express' Board should not impair American Express' ability to engage WilmerHale when American Express determines such engagements to be appropriate and in our best interests. The committee is satisfied that WilmerHale, when engaged for legal work, is chosen by American Express' legal group on the basis of the directly relevant factors of experience, expertise and efficiency. After considering the foregoing, the committee determined and recommended to the Board that American Express' professional engagement of WilmerHale does not impair Ambassador Barshefsky's independence.
Shareholder Engagement
Our Board's Commitment to Shareholder Engagement
Why We Engage
Our directors and management recognize the benefits that come from robust dialogue with shareholders and we have embraced an active shareholder engagement strategy for many years. We engage with shareholders throughout the year in order to:
Following our 2018 annual meeting, we engaged with shareholders representing approximately half of our outstanding shares on corporate governance, executive compensation and related matters. During these meetings, depending on the investor's priorities, we discussed and sought direct feedback on a broad number of issues including our CEO transition, company strategy and performance, board composition, and the results of our 2018 Say on Pay Vote. Please see "Shareholder Engagement and Responsiveness to 2018 Say on Pay Vote" starting on page 45, for a detailed discussion of the changes we have made to our executive compensation program in response to this shareholder feedback.

Compensation of Directors
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews director compensation and seeks to compensate our directors in a manner that attracts and retains highly qualified directors and aligns the interests of our directors with those of our long-term shareholders. In 2018, the Committee engaged an independent compensation advisory firm, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, to assist the committee in its review of the competitiveness and structure of the Company's non-management director compensation. This review included a competitive benchmarking of our director compensation against the 20 companies that our Compensation and Benefits Committee examines as a reference when examining the competitiveness of our executive compensation practices, as well as the S&P 100 and certain financial institutions. After completing its review, the Nominating and Governance Committee recommended modest increases to our program effective January 1, 2018, in order to better position our program from a competitive standpoint going forward, as described below.
The following table provides information on the 2018 compensation of non-management directors who served for all or a part of 2018. We reimburse directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses attendant to their board service.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Annual Retainers. For service in 2018, we paid non-management directors an annual retainer of $95,000 for board service and an additional annual retainer of $20,000 to members of the Audit and Compliance and Risk Committees, $10,000 to members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and $5,000 to members of the Innovation and Technology, Nominating and Governance, and Public Responsibility Committees. We also paid an annual retainer to the Chair of each of the Board committees as follows: Audit and Compliance, Compensation and Benefits, Innovation and Technology, Public Responsibility and Risk, $20,000; Nominating and Governance, $25,000. We pay no fees for attending meetings, but the annual retainer for board service of $95,000 is reduced by $20,000 if a director does not attend at least 75% of his or her aggregate board and committee meetings. Effective March 13, 2018, our Board approved several revisions to the leadership and membership of our standing committees. Each director affected by these changes (Charlene Barshefsky, John J. Brennan, Ralph de la Vega, Michael O. Leavitt, Theodore J. Leonsis, Ronald A. Williams and Christopher D. Young) received corresponding pro-rated fees. In addition, each of our Lead Independent Directors during 2018, Robert D. Walter and Ronald A. Williams received a pro-rated annual retainer of $4,931 and $20,069, respectively. 
  All non-management directors, except Ursula M. Burns, deferred all or a portion of their 2018 retainers into a cash account, a share equivalent unit (SEU) account, or both, under the deferred compensation plan described below in footnote 2. 
(2)  Share Equivalent Unit Plan. To align our non-management directors' annual compensation with shareholder interests, each non-management director is credited with common SEUs upon election or reelection at each annual meeting of shareholders. Each SEU reflects the value of one common share. 
  Directors receive additional SEUs as dividend equivalents on the units in their accounts. SEUs do not carry voting rights and must be held at least until a director ends his or her service on the Board. Each SEU is payable in cash equal to the then value of one common share at the time of distribution to the director. On May 7, 2018, the date of last year's annual meeting, each non-management director elected to the Board was credited with SEUs having a value of $190,000, which consisted of 1,931 SEUs, based on the market price of our common shares for the average of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such date. In addition, each of our Lead Independent Directors during 2018, Robert D. Walter and Ronald A. Williams, received an annual SEU retainer of $14,792 and $60,208, respectively, which consisted of 159 and 603 SEUs, respectively, for the portion of the year when each was in the role, based on the market price of our common shares for the average of the last 10 trading days of such calendar quarter. We report in this column the aggregate grant date fair value of these SEUs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors. Non-management directors may defer the receipt of up to 100% of their annual cash retainer fees into either: (1) a cash account in which amounts deferred will be credited at the rate of 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate for December of the prior year or (2) their SEU account. Under either alternative, directors will receive cash payments and will not receive shares upon payout of their deferrals.
The balances in directors' SEU accounts at December 31, 2018 are set forth in the table below. These amounts represent the aggregate number of SEUs granted under the SEU Plan for all years of service as a director, additional units credited as a result of the reinvestment of dividend equivalents and, for directors who participated in the SEU option under our deferred compensation plan for directors, retainer amounts deferred into their SEU account and dividend equivalents thereon.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Insurance. We provide our non-management directors with group term life insurance coverage of $50,000. The group life insurance policy is provided to the directors on a basis generally available to all company employees. This column includes the premium paid for such coverage. 
  Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents are reinvested in additional units for all directors based upon total SEUs held at the time of company quarterly dividend payment dates. This column includes the fair market value of the dividend equivalents received by the directors during 2018 in these amounts: Amb. Barshefsky $88,894, Mr. Brennan $7,655, Ms. Burns $49,063, Mr. Chernin $54,959, Mr. de la Vega $11,076, Ms. Lauvergeon $27,725, Gov. Leavitt $18,881, Mr. Leonsis $39,030, Mr. Levin $49,062, Mr. Palmisano $21,620, Dr. Vasella $34,723, Mr. Walter $68,872, Mr. Williams $89,957, and Mr. Young $1,815. 
  Directors' Charitable Award Program. We maintain a Directors' Charitable Award Program for directors elected prior to July 1, 2004. To fund this program, we purchased joint life insurance on the lives of participating directors. The death benefit of $500,000 funds a donation to a charitable organization that the director recommends. The Company paid no premiums for the policies of non-management directors who served for all or part of 2018. 
  Matching Gift Program. Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's Matching Gift Program on the same basis as Company employees. Under this program, the American Express Foundation matches gifts to approved charitable organizations up to $8,000 per calendar year. This column includes the amounts matched with respect to calendar year 2018. 
(4)  Ms. Burns and Mr. Walter retired from our Board on May 7, 2018.  
(5)  Messrs. Levin and Palmisano will retire from our Board on May 7, 2019.  
(6)  Mr. Young was elected to our Board effective March 13, 2018.

Director Stock Ownership
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that non-management directors are required to obtain a personal holding of shares (directly or through SEUs) with a value of $1 million within five years of joining the Board.
Director Trading in Company Securities
As set forth in the Company's Code of Business Conduct for Members of the Board, directors must pre-clear every transaction in Company securities for themselves, immediate family members, or any family trust with the Corporate Secretary. This includes gifts, transactions in discretionary accounts and non-routine transactions such as optional cash purchases in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Additionally, Directors may not engage in short sales or put or call or other hedge transactions in Company shares. Directors may not pledge Company shares (which includes holding shares in a margin account) without prior pre-clearance.

Director and Officer Liability Insurance
We have an insurance program in place to provide coverage for director and officer liability and for fiduciary liability arising from employee benefit plans we sponsor. The coverage for director and officer liability provides that, subject to the policy terms and conditions, the insurers will: (i) reimburse us when we are legally permitted to indemnify our directors and officers; (ii) pay losses, including settlements, judgments and legal fees, on behalf of our directors and officers when we cannot indemnify them; and (iii) pay our losses resulting from certain securities claims. The fiduciary liability portion of the program covers: us; our employee benefit plans; and the directors, trustees and employees who serve as fiduciaries for our employee benefit plans. Subject to the policy terms and conditions, it covers losses from alleged breaches of fiduciary or administrative duties, as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or similar laws or regulations. A portion of the program is blended with certain other insurances covering the company.
Effective from November 30, 2018 to November 30, 2019, this insurance is provided by a consortium of insurers. ACE American Insurance Company is the lead insurer. XL Specialty Insurance Company, Illinois National Insurance Company, Allied World Assurance Company Ltd., Freedom Specialty Insurance Company, Markel Bermuda Ltd., American International Reinsurance Company Ltd., Allianz Insurance Company, Starr Indemnity and Liability Company, Everest National Insurance Company, Continental Casualty Company, and Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company provide excess coverage. The program also includes supplemental layers dedicated exclusively to providing coverage for directors and officers when we cannot indemnify them. The supplemental layers are provided by XL Specialty Insurance Company, ACE American Insurance Company, Zurich American Insurance Company, Illinois National Insurance Company, Continental Casualty Company, U.S. Specialty Insurance Company, American International Reinsurance Company Ltd., Freedom Specialty Insurance Company, Everest National Insurance Company, Allianz Insurance Company, Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, Allied World Assurance Company, Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd., and certain Lloyd's of London syndicates. We expect to obtain similar coverage upon expiration of the current program. The annual premium for the program is approximately $4.4 million.
Certain Relationships and Transactions
In the ordinary course of our business, we engage in transactions, arrangements and relationships with many other entities, including financial institutions and professional organizations. Some of our directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% shareholders, and their immediate family members (each, a Related Person) may be directors, officers, partners, employees or shareholders of these entities. We carry out transactions with these entities on customary terms and, in many instances, these Related Persons may not have knowledge of them. To the Company's knowledge, since January 1, 2018, no Related Person has had a material interest in any of our ongoing business transactions or relationships except as described below.
Our Related Person Transaction Policy
Our written Related Person Transaction Policy governs company transactions, arrangements and relationships involving more than $120,000 in which a Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest (Related Person Transactions). Under the policy, Related Person Transactions must be approved by the Nominating and Governance Committee, other than certain pre-approved transactions (described below). The Committee will only approve a transaction if, after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances, it determines that the transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company. In the event we become aware of a Related Person Transaction that was not approved under the policy, the Committee will consider the options available, including ratification, revision or termination of the transaction. The policy does not supersede any other company policy or procedure that may apply to any Related Person Transaction, including our Corporate Governance Principles and codes of conduct.
The Company's Corporate Secretary is responsible for assisting the Nominating and Governance Committee in carrying out its responsibilities, and management is required to present to the committee the material facts of any transaction that it believes may require review. In cases when it is impracticable or undesirable to delay a decision on a proposed transaction until the next meeting of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Chair may review and approve the transaction and then report any approval to the full committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. If a matter before the Nominating and Governance Committee involves a member of the committee, the member must be recused and may not participate in deliberations or vote on the matter.
Table of Contents
Pre-Approved Categories of Related Person Transactions
The Nominating and Governance Committee has pre-approved certain categories of transactions as being consistent with the best interests of the Company. These categories, which may exceed the proscribed threshold for Related Person Transactions, include but are not limited to director and executive officer compensation, use of Company products and services, transactions involving indebtedness to the Company, certain banking-related transactions, immaterial ordinary course transactions with other entities, charitable contributions and indemnification payments.
Related Party Transactions
Our executive officers and directors may from time to time take out loans from certain of our subsidiaries on the same terms that these subsidiaries offer to the general public. For example, our U.S. card-issuing bank may extend credit to our directors and executive officers under our charge or lending products. All indebtedness from these transactions is in the ordinary course of our business and is on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, in effect for comparable transactions with other people. Such indebtedness involves normal risks of collection and does not have features or terms that are unfavorable to our subsidiaries. Our executive officers and directors may also have transactions with us involving other goods and services, such as travel services and investments in deposit products offered by subsidiaries of the Company. These transactions are also in the ordinary course of our business, and we provide them on terms that we offer to our customers generally. Occasionally, we may have employees who are related to our executive officers, directors or director nominees. We compensate these individuals in a manner consistent with our practices that apply to all employees. The sister-in-law of Mr. Squeri, our Chairman and CEO, is employed by the Company in a non-executive position and received compensation in 2018 of between $260,000 and $290,000. The compensation and other terms of employment of Mr. Squeri's sister-in-law are determined on a basis consistent with the Company's human resources policies.
Certain executive officers, directors and members of their immediate families are directors, employees or have equity interests in companies with whom the Company has entered into ordinary course business relationships from time to time and with whom the Company may enter into additional ordinary course business relationships. These may include ordinary course merchant acceptance relationships pursuant to which these companies accept our charge and credit card products and pay us fees when their customers use these cards, as well as use of the Company's cards and financial and other products and services, including extensions of credit, on terms and conditions similar to those available to other customers generally. From time to time, we may enter into joint marketing or other relationships with one or more of these companies in the ordinary course that encourage customers to apply for and use our cards. We also may provide ordinary course commercial card and bill payments services or business insights to some of these companies, for which these companies pay fees to us. We may engage in other commercial transactions with these companies, and pay or receive fees in those transactions. We have a number of similar ordinary course relationships with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and its subsidiaries. We have also purchased insurance and other products from subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in the ordinary course of business and on arm's-length terms.

Audit Committee Matters
The Audit and Compliance Committee has sole authority to appoint and replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Committee, and is directly responsible for its compensation and oversight of its work. The Audit and Compliance Committee conducted its annual evaluation of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and, after assessing the performance and independence of PwC, the Committee believes that retaining PwC is in the best interests of the Company. The Audit and Compliance Committee reappointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
We are asking you to ratify this appointment. If shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit and Compliance Committee will consider it a directive to consider other accounting firms for the subsequent year. One or more representatives of PwC will be present at the meeting, will be given the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
RESOLVED, that the appointment by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, to audit the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for 2019, is hereby ratified and approved.

Actions Taken by the Audit and Compliance Committee to Support its Recommendation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit and Compliance Committee charter requires a detailed review of the independent audit firm including as compared to other firms at least every 10  years    PwC has been our independent auditor since 2005. This review, conducted in 2014, assessed PwC's performance across the following criteria: professional expertise, audit engagement team  performance, communications, independence and objectivity, and fees. A wide range of internal stakeholders were surveyed and asked to comment generally, identify areas for recognition and improvement, and indicate how PwC's performance was trending  over time. PwC's audit fees were benchmarked against other firms based on publicly available data. The positive results of the review resulted in the decision to continue to engage PwC and also identified several areas with opportunity for  improvement that were discussed with PwC. 
 PwC's objectivity and independence    Reviews relationships between PwC and American Express that may reasonably be thought to bear on independence and reviews PwC's annual affirmation of independence. Recognizing that independence  and objectivity can be compromised by an auditor's provision of non-audit services, the Audit and Compliance Committee has approved a management policy governing the provision of services by PwC. 
 Quality of PwC's auditing practices and PwC's commitment to quality, efficiency and adding value    Reviews issues raised by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) reports on PwC, PwC's internal quality control procedures and results of PwC's most recent quality control  reviews, as well as issues raised by recent governmental investigations, if any. Discusses PwC's quality initiatives and the steps PwC is taking to enhance the quality and efficiency of its audits with the lead engagement partner and with the PwC  senior relationship partner assigned to American Express. 
 PwC's performance as auditor    Discusses and comments on PwC's audit plan and strategy for the audit, including  the objectives, overall scope  and structure, the resources provided and available at the firm, and the Audit and Compliance Committee's expectations. Receives periodic updates from the lead engagement partner on the status of the audit and areas of  focus by PwC. 
 Performance of lead engagement partner    The lead engagement partner of PwC is subject to a mandatory five-year rotation period. The Audit and Compliance Committee chair is involved in selecting the lead engagement partner. In preparation  for the current lead engagement partner mandatory rotation, which takes effect in 2019, a new lead engagement partner has been selected. During the year, the Audit and Compliance Committee chair meets one-on-one with the  lead engagement partner to promote a candid dialogue and the Audit and Compliance Committee meets in executive session with the lead engagement partner to discuss the progress of the audit and any audit issues, deliver Audit and Compliance Committee  feedback and discuss any other relevant matters. 
 PwC's communications with the Audit and Compliance Committee    Audit and Compliance Committee gives feedback to the lead engagement partner on the clarity, thoroughness and timeliness of PwC's communications to the Audit and Compliance  Committee. 
 Terms of the engagement and audit fees    Audit and Compliance Committee reviews the engagement letter and approves PwC's audit and non-audit fees.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Fees and Services
Fees for 2018 and 2017
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed or to be billed by PwC for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Fees  $ 23,704    $ 23,415 
(1) PwC performs the audit of the Company's pension plans for Switzerland and Hong Kong where the fees are paid by the respective plan. These fees are not included in Audit-Related Fees  since they were not paid by the Company. The total fees for these two audits in each of 2018 and 2017 were $8K and $31K for each year, respectively. 
[END TABLE]
In the table above, in accordance with SEC rules, "Audit Fees" consist of fees for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements, review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports, and services provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and other attest services. "Audit-Related Fees" consist of fees for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. The services included employee benefit plan audits, internal control reviews, attest services not required by statute or regulation, and consultations on financial accounting and reporting matters not classified as audit. "Tax Fees" consist of fees for professional services rendered for tax compliance and tax consulting services. "All Other Fees" are fees for any services not included in the first three categories.
Policy on Pre-Approval of Services Provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
The terms of our engagement of PwC are subject to the pre-approval of the Audit and Compliance Committee. All audit and permitted non-audit services require pre-approval by the Audit and Compliance Committee in accordance with pre-approval procedures established by the Audit and Compliance Committee. In accordance with SEC rules, the Audit and Compliance Committee's pre-approval procedures have two different approaches to pre-approving audit and permitted non-audit services performed by PwC.
The Audit and Compliance Committee specifically pre-approves the terms and fees of the planned annual audit and permitted non-audit services that are to be performed by PwC. Other proposed engagements may be pre-approved up to an aggregate fee threshold, pursuant to procedures established by the Audit and Compliance Committee that are detailed as to the particular and defined classes of services without consideration by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the specific case-by-case services to be performed. We refer to this pre-approval method as "general pre-approval" and the Company's Controller reports such pre-approved engagements to the Audit and Compliance Committee at least quarterly.
The procedures also require all proposed engagements of PwC for services of any kind that have not received specific or general pre-approval as described above be approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee (or, should a time-sensitive need arise, its Chair) prior to the beginning of any such services. All services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm have been pre-approved in accordance with these procedures. The Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed that the services performed by PwC and the related fees were consistent with the maintenance of PwC's independence.
Other Transactions with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
We have a number of business relationships with individual member firms of the worldwide PwC organization. Our subsidiaries provide card services to some of these firms and these firms pay fees to our subsidiaries. These services are in the normal course of business, and we provide them pursuant to arrangements that we offer to other similar clients.

Report of the Audit and Compliance Committee
A role of the Audit and Compliance Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of the company's financial reporting process. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. PwC is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, and expressing opinions as to the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PwC the Company's audited financial statements. The Audit and Compliance Committee also has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as adopted by the PCAOB, relating to communications with audit committees. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee has received from PwC the written disclosures and letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding PwC's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, has discussed with PwC their independence from the Company and its management, and has considered whether PwC's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining the firm's independence.
The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed with the Company's Chief Audit Executive and PwC the overall scope and plan for their respective audits. Internal Audit is responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and conducting internal audits under the direction of the Company's Chief Audit Executive, who is accountable to the Audit and Compliance Committee. The Audit and Compliance Committee met with the Chief Audit Executive, the Controller and PwC, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the company's financial reporting. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee met with the CEO and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to discuss the processes that they have undertaken to evaluate the accuracy and fair presentation of the Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company's systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Compliance Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Executive Compensation
Pursuant to regulations under Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs disclosed in the CD&A, the compensation tables, notes and narrative in this proxy statement.
Our Board believes that the compensation of our executive officers is aligned with performance, is sensitive to our share price, appropriately motivates and retains our executives and is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining the high caliber of executive talent necessary to drive our business forward and build sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our executive compensation program delivers pay which is strongly linked to Company performance over time.
We engage with shareholders throughout the year, including discussing our compensation program and practices, and we also obtain feedback through this annual say on pay vote. Although this advisory vote is non-binding, the results of this vote and the views expressed by our shareholders in these discussions will inform the Compensation and Benefits Committee's future decisions about our executive compensation.
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including in the CD&A, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved.

Business, Strategic and Financial Performance
2018 was a strong year. Our results reflected strong performance from our focus on, and investment in, our four strategic imperatives – expand our presence in the premium consumer space, build on our position in commercial payments, strengthen our global, integrated network and make American Express an essential part of our customers' digital lives. Billings and loan growth reflected momentum across our business and we continued to accelerate revenue growth. We continued to invest in new services and Card Member benefits, new card acquisitions and expanding our merchant network, and we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders through our share buyback program and an increase in our dividend. The Compensation and Benefits Committee (CBC) determined the Company's performance to be significantly above the target levels established in the Company's performance scorecard, and took this into consideration in assigning annual bonuses for 2018 (see pages 52–53 for additional details).
Performance Highlights
Executive Compensation Principles and Strategy
Our executive pay program is thoughtful, consistent and continues to align with our Company's business strategy.
These principles have served us well for many years, and we have continued to refine them in response to input from shareholders and regulators, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve).
Table of Contents
Shareholder Engagement and Responsiveness to 2018 Say on Pay Vote
Important to executing our principles outlined above, we actively seek feedback from our shareholders and other stakeholders. In 2018, we met with shareholders and constituents representing approximately half of our outstanding shares to discuss executive compensation, corporate governance and related matters. In order to establish a direct line of communication between shareholders and our Board, our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Williams, actively participated in several of these meetings with key constituents. In light of the disappointing level of support for our 2018 say on pay vote (69.9%), we sought detailed input from shareholders and other stakeholders regarding specific aspects of our compensation programs. The table below summarizes what we heard and the actions taken by the Company in response.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Support for formulaic Annual Incentive Award (AIA), but some shareholders noted complexity of AIA due to use of multiple scorecards   ✓We simplified our AIA design such that all executives' annual incentives are now based on a single Company scorecard (as opposed to multiple scorecards as in prior years) to solidify enterprise-wide focus. This change was effective with our January 2018 AIA. 
 Support for ROE as a Performance Share metric, but questioned rigor of ROE goals under Performance Share plan and preference for relative performance comparison; a few shareholders also suggested use of TSR to further align management and shareholders' interests   ✓Redesigned Performance Shares to include relative ROE comparison along with a relative TSR modifier that provides target payout when the Company's ROE outperforms peers' ROE (see page 48 for more information on Performance Shares). This change was effective with our January 2019 grant cycle. 
 Portfolio Grant (long-term cash) program is cash-based, complex and not fully formulaic   ✓Eliminated Portfolio Grant program beginning in 2019 and transitioned target award values to 100% equity with three-year vesting tied to Company and stock performance to strengthen alignment with shareholder interests. This simplified the overall program structure and eliminated discretion while continuing to tie compensation to three-year performance. This change was effective with our January 2019 grant cycle. 
 Preference for disclosure of goals under incentive plans at the start of each performance cycle   ✓Enhanced disclosure of our goal setting process and disclosure of goals at the end of each performance cycle 
 Interest in role of Human Capital Management metrics under incentive plan   ✓Enhanced disclosure of Human Capital metrics under incentive plan 
 Concerns with outgoing CEO office support   ✓The CBC has determined that the Company will not provide similar office support to future retiring CEOs. This change is effective for CEOs retiring after 2018. The outgoing CEO compensation reported in this CD&A became payable in connection with Mr. Chenault's retirement in early 2018 
 Interest in our process to evaluate Gender Pay Equity   ✓We recently published the results of an independent third-party review of our pay practices on our website, which found that our colleagues in the U.S. are compensated equitably with no evidence of bias, regardless of gender

Compensation Programs
The following table summarizes the key elements of our executive compensation program and demonstrates the program's focus on annual and long-term incentive compensation that is closely aligned with Company performance and is sensitive to the Company's stock performance:

Target Pay Mix
The current target pay mix applicable to our NEOs demonstrates alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. CEO compensation is linked to the financial, strategic and operational performance of the Company. The CEO's target compensation is 92% performance-based, and on average, 89% of NEO compensation is performance-based:

Annual Incentive Award
The AIA is an annual cash-denominated performance-based component of executive compensation designed to recognize Company performance as well as exceptional individual performance. Performance is assessed against measurable goals reviewed and approved by the CBC at the beginning of the year.
The AIA is structured to reflect specific and measureable Company goals, including key objectives in four categories: Shareholder, Customer, Colleague and Strategic Imperatives. The CBC believes each performance metric is a clear driver of annual Company performance and aligns with the Company's focus on continued long-term value creation.
For 2018, the CBC determined that all executives' annual incentives would be measured based on the same broad Company scorecard, in contrast to multiple scorecards as in prior years, to solidify an enterprise-wide focus and simplify our program. The Company scorecard is based on the following metrics:
The AIA is a formulaic program that considers quantitative goals set at the beginning of the fiscal year, along with individual performance, to determine the final payout. The design works as follows for each NEO:
Table of Contents
Long-Term Incentive Award
Our updated LTIA program is intended to be formulaic and link compensation to the achievement of long-term financial objectives. LTIA is awarded in two forms: Performance Shares (80% of award) and Stock Options (20% of award). Each of these incentives aligns NEOs' interests with those of shareholders and establishes retention incentives through multi-year, performance-based vesting periods. The elements of the Company's LTIA and their respective features are described in the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Shares● 3-year average ROE as compared to performance peers● Relative TSR compared to the same performance peers as ROE● 3-year vesting period● Payout tied to 3-year relative performance and stock price performance● 0-120% of target shares awarded
Performance Shares● 3-year average ROE as compared to performance peers● Relative TSR compared to the same performance peers as ROE● 3-year vesting period● Payout tied to 3-year relative performance and stock price performance● 0-120% of target shares awarded
[END TABLE]
The new LTIA program aligns with our business objectives and reflects shareholder feedback. Among the feedback we received from investors, we heard support for the use of ROE as a performance measure under our long-term incentives. In addition, some shareholders suggested that the CBC could consider use of relative TSR and relative ROE, to measure both operational and shareholder-based results. The CBC considered this feedback and decided to modify our Performance Share program. Accordingly, the revised program requires top-quartile ROE to be earned at target, and above-target payouts are contingent on TSR performance being in the top third of our peer group. Median ROE performance results in an 80% payout.
[BEGIN TABLE]
AXP Relative ROE Rank       Payout%(1)               AXP TSR Positioning        Adjust Payout

[END TABLE]
Relative ROE performance: As a financial institution with a lending book and considerable fee income, we consider effective returns on capital to be a validation of high performance. Our ROE performance must be at the 75th percentile of our performance peers to provide the target number of shares.
Relative TSR performance: Our TSR performance must be in the top third of our performance peer group for payouts above target, regardless of our ROE performance.
Performance Peers: Our comparators include the largest financial companies in the lending and payments business, and reflect strong alignment with the Company's business. Our peer group for this revised LTIA program includes the Company's key competitors as well as a subset of S&P 500 Financials within similar industries as the Company and with ROEs subject to Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and other similar macroeconomic conditions as the Company, including global credit, lending and regulatory trends:

Perquisites
We provide limited perquisites to support our objective to attract and retain talent for key positions, as well as to address security concerns. For example, we provide a $30,000 local travel allowance for NEOs other than our CEO. For the CEO, the Company's security policy requires him to use for all travel purposes, to the maximum extent practicable, the automobiles and aircraft provided by the Company for business travel. We also provide an annual cash perquisite allowance of $35,000 for executive officers of the Company.
Post-Employment Compensation
Retirement Benefits
NEOs receive retirement benefits through the following plans:
NEO retirement benefits are more fully described under Retirement Plan Benefits on page 73 and under Nonqualified Deferred Compensation on pages 74 and 75.
Severance: Senior Executive Severance Policy
The CBC must pre-approve severance for an executive officer. Under the Senior Executive Severance Policy, NEOs who are terminated involuntarily (except in cases of misconduct) are eligible to receive cash severance benefits. In 2018, the CBC reduced executive severance benefits from two years of base salary and AIA to one and a half years of base salary and target AIA in consideration of market practices. The Company also provides pro rata AIA payment for the year of termination. LTIAs continue to vest and certain benefits continue during the severance period, unless the executive begins full-time, outside employment. U.S.-based NEOs who are age 65 or older are not eligible for severance unless the CBC specifically approves severance for such an executive.
To protect shareholders and our business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation, confidentiality and non-denigration provisions during the period of time they are receiving severance. Our uniform severance policy helps to avoid special treatment and provides an important enforcement mechanism for these protections.
Change in Control Benefits
The Company provides change in control benefits to encourage executives to consider the best interests of shareholders by addressing any concerns about their own personal financial well-being in the face of a potential change in control of the Company. Detailed information is provided under Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control on pages 75–78.

Compensation Process, Program Governance and Administration
The Company's compensation governance and administration practices conform with market practices and reinforce our compensation principles.
Compensation Governance Practices
The Company's executive compensation program is governed independently by the CBC with the advice and support of the Company's independent compensation consultant as well as the Company's management team. The following are key characteristics of the Company's executive compensation program, which we believe promote good governance and best serve the interests of our shareholders: 
Evaluating Performance: Selecting Metrics and Setting Targets
The CBC reviews and approves comprehensive performance goals annually and remains actively engaged throughout the year to monitor Company strategy and performance toward goals. The following describes the Company's process for selecting incentive program metrics and setting challenging yet achievable targets that are aligned with the Company's strategic direction.
Key Steps in Selecting Incentive Metrics and Setting Targets
[BEGIN TABLE]
        1                 2              3       
    Our Board reviews the competitive environment and our business strategy throughout the year, and keeps abreast of regulatory, competitive and technological developments.      The CBC reviews and approves final incentive plan metrics and goals early each year.    The CBC remains engaged throughout the year, evaluates annual performance and determines final payout amounts based on the achievement of goals. 
[END TABLE]
Peer Group and Benchmarking
Our pay program is designed to reward achievement of financial and strategic goals and to attract, retain and motivate our leaders in a competitive talent market. The CBC periodically examines pay practices and pay data for a group of 20 companies as a source of benchmarking data to better understand the competitiveness of our compensation program and its various elements. While the benchmarking data is used to assess the competitiveness of our compensation program, it is only one of a number of factors used to make final pay decisions.

How We Select the Company's Compensation Peers
In selecting the current compensation peer group, the CBC identified prominent S&P 500 companies, generally with revenue levels similar to ours, falling into the following categories: (1) financial institutions; (2) iconic global consumer brands; and (3) payments and technology businesses.

NEOs' Total Direct Compensation Decisions for 2018 Made in January 2019
The 2018 Compensation Decisions table below reflects the CBC's compensation decisions with regard to the NEOs' 2018 performance-based compensation including AIA, Performance Shares and stock options, based on the CBC's January 2019 assessment of the Company's and each executive's performance during 2018. Since the CBC's pay decisions were made based on these assessments that were conducted after the end of the 2018 fiscal year, some of these values differ from amounts listed in the Summary Compensation Table (on page 66) which shows compensation awarded during 2018.(15)
[BEGIN TABLE]
(15)  A reconciliation of this table to the Summary Compensation Table is shown on page 65. The amounts shown in this table also differ from those shown in the Pay Decisions table on pages 60-61 because that table reflects changes to NEO target compensation levels used to make pay decisions. In April 2018, Messrs. Campbell, Buckminster and Williams received additional equity awards ($500,000, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively) considering a number of factors, such as a change in role, additional responsibilities, and the level of compensation provided by our peers for similar roles. These amounts are not included in the table above because they are adjustments to their target compensation level, as shown on pages 60-61. 
(16)  Ms. Marrs is based in our London office and is paid in pounds sterling. Her base salary is £580,000. This amount was converted into U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 0.766, the average daily rate from August 2018 through October 2018 as published by AIRINC, a third-party data provider. This conversion rate is also used for converting other compensation paid to Ms. Marrs and reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
(17)  To comply with regulatory guidance that at least 50% of incentive compensation be deferred, $600,000 of Mr. Campbell's 2018 AIA was paid in the form of RSUs granted in January 2019. Mr. Campbell's AIA figure in the above table does not reflect this adjustment. These RSUs are payable three years after the grant date and continued employment through the end of the three-year period is not required to receive these RSUs. Further, to satisfy regulatory guidance, the payout of these RSUs is subject to the Company achieving positive cumulative net income in 2019-2021. 
(18)  Ms. Marrs received her target AIA of £1,150,000 in February 2019 for performance year 2018 under the terms of her offer letter. This award was converted into U.S. dollars using the 0.766 exchange rate described above. Under the Company's Detrimental Conduct Policy, this amount is subject to clawback if Ms. Marrs leaves the Company within two years of payments to join a competitor or engages in conduct that is detrimental to the Company. The same clawback feature applies to all other NEOs and is discussed further on page 63. 
(19)  The CBC did not grant Mr. Chenault any long-term incentive specifically in relation to his retirement or service in 2018. See pages 59-60 for additional information.

2018 Annual Incentive Awards
2018 Company Performance Outcomes
For 2018, the CBC reviewed Company performance and determined that performance was significantly above target, and approved the Company performance multiplier at 130% of target above target but below the maximum multiplier of 150% under the Company's formulaic plan.
PERFORMANCE MULTIPLIER – COMPANY
In determining the Company portion of the Performance Multiplier at 130%, the CBC evaluated the following results against the performance objectives approved for all NEOs by the CBC at the beginning of 2018. Goals approved by the CBC at the start of the year were consistent with the full-year guidance that the Company provided publicly in January 2018. The Company's four strategic imperatives, first shared in October 2017 and reiterated during the Company's March 2018 Investor Day presentation, also formed the basis for the AIA compensation. For 2018, achieving CBC-approved goals would result in a 100% payout. For each metric, the goals serve as a midpoint for a range of outcomes that could result in a higher or lower payout. The high end of the range represents challenging growth levels set by the CBC. In 2018, actual results exceeded the high end of the range, resulting in a 130% payout.

PERFORMANCE MULTIPLIER – INDIVIDUAL
In determining the Individual portion of the AIA multiplier for the NEOs, the CBC has discretion to modify awards downward or upward to differentiate and reward leadership performance. For 2018, factors considered in determining the appropriate individual multiplier for the NEOs included leadership through the Company's CEO transition and demonstrating the Company's enumerated leadership behaviors (Setting the Agenda, Bringing Others With You and Doing It the Right Way). The maximum individual performance multiplier for leadership performance is 125%.
Summary of NEO AIA for 2018
The following table summarizes the actual AIA earned by each NEO for the 2018 performance year based on the achievement of goals detailed above (in thousands).
Settlement of LTIA granted in January 2016
Portfolio Grant Awarded in January 2016 (Vesting Based on 2016-2018 Performance)
The Portfolio Grant (PG) is a program with three-year performance cycles. Under the program, management is assessed and rewarded for performance against a combination of financial objectives (three-year EPS and three-year Revenue) and results against specific strategic milestones that indicate success in positioning the Company for the future. The CBC selected the three-year EPS and three-year Revenue metrics because management believes a strong correlation exists between performance on these financial measures and increases in total shareholder value.
Table of Contents
PG goals are rigorous and meaningful performance is required for awards to pay out at target levels, as demonstrated by historical payout levels:
PG Award Payout History (as a% of Target)
Based on its assessment of performance against the targeted metrics as described in the following sections, the CBC determined that 2016-2018 performance targets were achieved at the maximum level for most objectives and set the payout for the 2016-2018 cycle at 124% - above target. The following sections explain the scoring and rationale for this determination:
THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE EPS (30% OF PORTFOLIO GRANT)
The target goal established at the beginning of the three-year cycle was cumulative earnings of $17.30 per share, a level of earnings consistent with the Company's business plan and management expectations at the start of the performance period. The goal is based on a Plan that reflected the end of the Costco relationship and related sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio in June 2016, and plans for the management team to identify new sources of earnings. The Plan was also the basis for earnings guidance provided for 2016 and 2017 during the fourth quarter 2015 earnings call in January 2016 and for 2017 during the March 2016 Investor Day. Actual performance in both 2016 and 2017 was a positive indicator of performance beyond management's initial expectations.
The EPS targets include share repurchases, given that a primary objective of the Company and the Board is to create shareholder value and optimize long-term financial returns. As part of this, each year management proposes a capital plan that allocates capital to support business growth, both organically and through acquisition, ensures that the Company maintains target capital levels, and returns capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve and its capital plan must be compliant with standards prescribed by the Federal Reserve. The capital plan is reviewed by the Company's Board, which has ultimate oversight responsibility for capital planning and is in the best position to make informed decisions regarding the Company's capital adequacy and capital actions, including capital distributions.
On a GAAP basis, cumulative earnings were $16.53 per share; however, the CBC deemed it appropriate to consider adjustments to the Company's reported results when determining the payout for this factor to exclude the following positive and negative amounts to account for the impact of events that were not contemplated when setting goals at the start of 2016. The CBC considered these adjustments appropriate so that management does not benefit or get penalized by one-time events.
On an adjusted basis, the Company earned $18.16 per share over the time period, which would correspond to a 121% payout against target for this factor.(35)
Table of Contents
Note: If the three-year EPS is between two points, straight-line interpolation will be applied.
2018 REVENUE (20% OF PORTFOLIO GRANT)
The target goal established at the beginning of the three-year cycle was to achieve $34 billion revenue in 2018, which incorporates a level of revenue growth consistent with the Company's long-term business plan and management's expectations at the start of the performance period. No payout would be earned on this factor for performance below a 2018 revenue total of $30.12 billion. The maximum payout, 125% of target, was set at a 2018 revenue total $35.02 billion. The business plan and management's expectations for the three-year performance cycle accounted for a changing business environment that included the expected end of the Costco relationship and related sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio in June 2016.
GAAP rules related to revenue recognition changed after the targets were set. As such, the Company adjusted the 2018 revenue goal to be $37.45 billion. This adjustment reflects the same level of growth as under the original targets.
On a GAAP basis, 2018 revenue was $40.34 billion; however, the CBC deemed it appropriate to consider adjustments to the Company's reported results when determining the payout for this factor to exclude FX impacts since these changes are beyond management's control and were not reflected in the original plan. On an adjusted basis, the Company finished 2018 with revenue of $40.46 billion, which would correspond to a 125% payout against target for this factor.(37)

PROGRESS ON STRATEGIC MILESTONES (50% OF PORTFOLIO GRANT)
The strategic milestones established for this grant covered a range of initiatives, including merchant coverage and operating expense initiatives. The range of payouts for achievement against strategic milestones, as with the other elements, is from zero to 125% of target. The CBC assesses results and performance for each strategic milestone goal in determining the final score outcome. Strategic milestones goals were:
Final Scoring for 2016-2018 Portfolio Grant
Based on the above discussions of actual performance against goals, the CBC concluded that the award was earned at significantly above target: 124% of its targeted amount.
The CEO and other NEOs' PG 2016-18 grants resulted in the following payouts ($000s):

RSUs Awarded in January 2016-Vesting Based on 2016-2018 Performance
Performance RSUs were awarded in January 2016 for the three-year performance period ending December 2018. The awards vest based on the Company's three-year average ROE performance. Our ROE results during the three-year period were strong. For example, we were able to increase our Common Equity Tier 1 capital by 200 basis points in 2018. We did this while increasing our dividend by 11% and returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
This resulted in the vesting of the following shares for the CEO and other NEOs:
Other Compensation Decisions
Offer Letter — Ms. Marrs
In March 2018, we hired Ms. Anna Marrs as our President of Global Commercial Services. Ms. Marrs has extensive, relevant experience to our Company having been CEO of Commercial & Private Banking and Regional CEO ASEAN & South Asia for Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and a partner in the banking practice at McKinsey & Co.
In order to provide a strong long-term incentive, to induce her to relocate from Singapore to London and to reimburse Ms. Marrs for compensation forfeited as a result of leaving SCB, the CBC negotiated an incentive-based compensation package commensurate with the compensation levels and target pay structures of similarly situated executives at peer companies. The Board considered the amount of the incentive compensation forfeited by Ms. Marrs upon joining our Company and the vesting/payment timing of the forfeited amounts, as well as the CBC's intent to provide a pay opportunity that promotes long-term Company performance.
Table of Contents
The following awards were provided as 2018 long-term incentive compensation and also in consideration that Ms. Marrs did not receive her 2018 long-term incentive grant from SCB considering her resignation from SCB. The performance terms of these awards are the same as the January 2018 grants to other NEOs to align her goals with those of all executives to drive enterprise-wide growth. These incentive awards are subject to both performance targets and continued employment, as well as subject to clawback under the Company's Detrimental Conduct Policy.
The following awards were provided considering Ms. Marrs' forfeited compensation with SCB:
Compensation for Prior CEO
Mr. Chenault retired from the Company on February 1, 2018. The Summary Compensation Table includes partial year 2018 compensation as well as deferred compensation from prior years (see below for details).
Compensation Received for 2018 Performance:
Mr. Chenault received 1/12th of his annual 2018 base salary and target AIA for serving as our CEO from 1/1/2018 to 1/31/2018.
The CBC did not grant Mr. Chenault any additional AIA or LTIA specifically in relation to his retirement or service in 2018.
Table of Contents
Compensation Reported in 2018:
As disclosed in last year's proxy statement, the CBC agreed to provide an annual stipend of $300,000 per year to Mr. Chenault for office space with administrative support for use after retirement (consistent with past Company practice for retiring CEOs) for a period of nine years (the year Mr. Chenault becomes age 75), with an additional one-time setup payment of $500,000 plus appropriate office hardware on a one-time basis, and driver support for security for one year. These values are reported as a lump-sum payment under All Other Compensation in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Additionally, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table includes other items reported as 2018 compensation due to SEC reporting rules for deferred compensation, according to the following table:
Pay Decisions
The compensation decisions described under this section reflect changes to target compensation levels that the CBC uses to make pay decisions, including target AIA and LTIA granted each January. These amounts differ from the compensation disclosed under the Summary Compensation Table because these are changes to target compensation levels and do not reflect actual compensation paid except when additional equity was granted (as explained below).
Table of Contents
These above decisions are changes to target amounts. Actual compensation paid depends on the Company performance, individual performance and the Company's stock price performance. Further, to strengthen our pay for performance link, a significant portion of the compensation is granted using equity awards and subject to sustained performance over a period of time.

Our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion
Our commitment to diversity and inclusivity is one of the Company's greatest strengths. The powerful backing of American Express is the brand promise we make to our customers, and we believe that the best way to back our customers is to back our people. That idea is central to our Colleague Value Proposition (CVP), which states our commitment to helping our people become great leaders, providing a world of opportunities to grow their careers, and creating an inclusive culture to help them thrive.
An essential part of delivering on our CVP is providing fair and equitable pay for all colleagues. At our Company, we have a longstanding commitment to offering a pay structure that is equitable, transparent and free from bias. To help us meet that commitment, we regularly review our compensation practices to ensure they support pay equity and transparency, and we are proud of our record. A recent independent third-party review of our pay programs in the U.S. found that our colleagues are compensated equitably with no evidence of bias, regardless of gender. We also recently completed an expanded review that included the top 10 countries where we do business – covering over 90% of our colleague base – and we extended the analysis to include U.S. minorities. The review looked at a number of factors and drivers of compensation, including tenure, role, level, geography and performance. The expanded review found that our female colleagues are paid equitably, earning well over 99 cents for every dollar earned by their male colleagues. In addition, the review found that minority colleagues in the U.S. are paid equitably, also earning well over 99 cents for every dollar earned by their non-minority colleagues in the U.S. We are firmly committed to pay equity globally and will periodically review our processes to ensure we remain equitable.
Attracting and engaging the best colleagues is critical to our success as we continue to work toward realizing our vision of providing the best customer experience every day. For this reason, we remain committed to evolving and enhancing our diversity and inclusion initiatives so that everyone can reach their full potential, and we will continue to hold our senior leaders accountable for elevating our commitment.
Discouraging Imprudent Risk Taking
Our executive compensation program is structured to provide a balance of cash and stock; annual, medium-term and long-term incentives; and financial and stock performance measures over various time periods. It is designed to encourage the proper level of risk taking consistent with our business model and strategies. Our business and risk profile is different from other financial services firms; for example, we do not generally trade securities, derivatives, mortgages or other financial instruments other than for hedging our risks. Our executive compensation program is designed to be consistent with the Federal Reserve principles for safety and soundness.
The following policies and procedures help discourage imprudent risk taking:
Table of Contents
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our current stock ownership guidelines require the CEO and our other NEOs to own and maintain a substantial stake in the Company. The CEO and our other NEOs are required to accumulate shares (i.e., shares owned outright, excluding unvested/unearned shares and unexercised stock options) with a value equivalent to a target multiple of their base salary, and to retain 50% of the net after-tax shares received upon vesting or exercise of their equity awards until guidelines are met. The specific requirements are as follows:
All of our NEOs except Ms. Marrs, who was recently hired, own more than the target number of shares. These requirements are reviewed annually and adjusted to consider NEO salary changes or changes in the Company's stock price.
Clawback Policies
We seek to recover, to the extent practicable, performance-based compensation from any executive officer and certain other members of senior management in the following circumstances: 
In addition, the cash portion of the CEO's AIA is subject to clawback at the discretion of the CBC if the Company does not achieve acceptable performance in the following year.
The Company also maintains a detrimental conduct policy covering approximately 475 colleagues, including the CEO. This policy requires an executive to forfeit unvested awards and to repay the proceeds from some or all of his or her compensation issued under our incentive compensation program in the event the executive engages in conduct that is detrimental to the Company.
Award Timing
Consistent with past practice, annual cycle LTIA awards were granted to NEOs in January after the regularly scheduled January CBC meeting. Our off-cycle LTIA awards (for new hires, mid-year promotions, retention grants, etc.) are granted on pre-established grant dates.
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant
The CBC endeavors to follow good governance practices and is composed solely of independent directors. The CBC is responsible for our executive officer compensation decisions. It has retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group (Semler Brossy) as its independent compensation consultant. It held six meetings over the course of 2018, all of which ended with executive sessions without management present. During 2018, Semler Brossy attended CBC meetings, including executive sessions, and provided compensation advice independent of the Company's management. The CBC assessed the independence of Semler Brossy pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that their work did not raise any conflicts of interest.
Table of Contents
Tax Treatment
Tax rules generally limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our NEOs to $1 million per year. Prior to the Tax Act, "performance-based" compensation was excepted from this limit and the Company generally structured its incentive compensation arrangements in a manner that was intended to comply with these tax rules. The CBC maintains the flexibility to pay nondeductible incentive compensation.
Report of the Compensation and Benefits Committee
The CBC has reviewed and discussed the CD&A with management. Based on such review and discussion, it recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the CD&A in this proxy statement.

Note Regarding 2018 TDC Decisions and Summary Compensation Table
It is important to recognize that the way the CBC presents TDC is different from the SEC-required disclosure in the Summary Compensation Table and is not a substitute for the information in that table.
In summary, the main difference between the Summary Compensation Table and TDC is the timing of disclosure related to equity awards. The chart below details this methodology.

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For 2018, local and other travel benefits include local travel allowance for NEOs other than Messrs. Squeri, Chenault and Williams. The Company's security policy requires the CEO to use for all travel purposes, to the maximum extent practicable, the automobiles and aircraft provided by the Company to executives for business travel. The calculation of the incremental cost for personal use of Company-owned automobiles and aircraft is based on the variable cost to the Company of operating the automobiles and aircraft and includes, among other things, fuel costs, maintenance costs and, in the case of aircraft, the cost of trip- related crew hotels and meals, and landing and ground handling fees. The calculation does not include fixed costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether there was any personal use of the automobiles or aircraft (e.g., purchase costs and depreciation, driver and flight crew fixed salaries and benefits, insurance costs, etc.). 
(2)  The CEO's personal use of Company aircraft is limited to $200,000 per year and the CEO is required to reimburse the Company any incremental costs in excess of $200,000 per year for travel on Company aircraft that is deemed by the SEC to be personal use. Messrs. Campbell and Buckminster's 2018 amounts are in connection with personal travel in accordance with appropriate approvals. 
(3)  The amount in this column reflects the perquisite allowance paid to the NEOs. 
(4)  The amounts in these columns include costs associated with home security and security during personal trips for Messrs. Squeri and Chenault. Mr. Squeri's amounts include $79,989 for security system installation and $1,493 for ongoing services. 
(5)  The amounts shown include international tax and reporting services (not payments or reimbursements) in connection with Mr. Buckminster's repatriation to the U.S. due to trailing tax liabilities. The services provided to Mr. Buckminster are provided to all employees on international assignment. Ms. Marrs' amount includes relocation reimbursements and payments, excluding tax payments. These payments were made in connection with Ms. Marrs' employment with American Express which required that she relocate her residence from Singapore to London. 
(6)  This column reflects the aggregate amount of other perquisites and personal benefits provided, none of which individually exceeded the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of all perquisites and other personal benefits reported for the NEO. These other benefits consist of office parking, reimbursement for certain information technology services, and, on occasion, use of the Company's tickets for sporting and entertainment events for personal rather than business purposes. We incur no incremental cost for the provision of such additional benefits.

Ms. Marrs is not eligible to participate in a pension plan in the U.K. and not eligible for U.S. benefits.
Pension Benefits 2018
Retirement Plan. The U.S.-paid NEOs (except for Mr. Campbell) participate in the Retirement Plan, which is a defined benefit cash balance retirement plan for eligible U.S. employees. As a result of amendments made to the Retirement Plan in 2007, benefit accruals were discontinued, although the Retirement Plan continues to credit participants with interest on their outstanding account balances. The Retirement Plan sets the interest rate each year based on the average of the interest rates for certain five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, with a minimum interest rate of 5%. The maximum interest rate is the lower of 10% or the applicable interest rate specified in the Retirement Plan. For 2018 and 2019, the interest rate is 5%. In addition, benefits from the prior retirement plan, which was terminated in 1985, are payable through an insurance contract with MetLife Company and are included in the table above.
RRP-Retirement Plan. Each RRP participant who participated in the Retirement Plan has a Retirement Plan related account for benefits that could not be provided under the Retirement Plan as a result of IRS limitations on tax-qualified plans. Compensation for RRP-Retirement Plan account purposes included the same components of compensation as for the Retirement Plan. RRP-Retirement Plan benefits accrue and vest in a similar manner to benefits under the Retirement Plan. Participants may elect to receive payment of their RRP-Retirement Plan benefits in either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or 15 consecutive years. Lump sum payments are made on or about the January 1 or July 1 that is at least six months following the participant's separation from service and installment payments commence on or about the July 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant separates from service.
As a result of amendments made to the Retirement Plan and RRP in 2007, benefit accruals were discontinued, however, like the Retirement Plan, the RRP- Retirement Plan continues to credit participants with interest on their outstanding balances in accordance with the Retirement Plan provision as described above.
Table of Contents
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The following table shows the executive or Company contributions, earnings, withdrawals and account balances for the U.S.-paid NEOs in the RRP-RSP accounts and the deferred compensation programs. These programs are unfunded, unsecured deferred compensation programs for eligible U.S. executives. There is no nonqualified deferred compensation program in the U.K.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 2018
RSP. Effective January 2010, all U.S. active participants, including the NEOs, were immediately 100% vested in the Company matching contribution, which is generally up to 5% of total pay (base pay and eligible incentive pay capped at one times base pay). The RSP was amended effective January 1, 2017 to increase the Company matching contribution from 5% to 6% of total pay.
The Company may also contribute an annual discretionary profit sharing amount for eligible U.S. employees based on the Company's annual performance. As a result of the Company's 2018 performance, the Board approved a profit sharing contribution of 3% of total pay for eligible U.S. employees (including NEOs). Company profit sharing contributions generally vest on the third anniversary of an employee's service with the Company.
For Company employees who commenced their employment prior to April 1, 2007, an additional conversion contribution of up to 8% of total pay is generally also contributed. The percentage varies by individual based on their projected age and service as of December 31, 2008. As a result of the amendments to the RSP effective January 1, 2017, conversion contributions stopped at the end of 2017 for certain executives including the NEOs and stopped at the end of 2018 for all other employees.

RRP-RSP. Each RRP participant has a RRP-RSP account for benefits that cannot be provided under the RSP as a result of IRS limitations on U.S. tax-qualified plans. The RRP was amended effective January 1, 2011, such that the Company matches employee contributions in the RRP-RSP account up to a maximum of 5% of total pay in excess of IRS compensation limits, only to the extent the employee voluntarily defers compensation under the Company's nonqualified Deferral Plan. All other Company contributions to the RRP-RSP were not impacted by this amendment. Compensation for RRP-RSP account purposes includes the same components of compensation as for the RSP, as well as the value of base pay and annual cash incentive amounts deferred by a participant under the nonqualified Deferral Plan. The RRP was amended effective January 1, 2017 to be consistent with the changes taking effect in the RSP for the Company matching contribution (increasing from 5% of total pay to 6% of total pay) and conversion contributions. Participants may elect to receive payment of their RRP-RSP benefits in either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or 15 consecutive years. The payment election applies to both the RRP-Retirement Plan and RRP-RSP balances. New participants will have a default lump sum election for contributions attributable to the first year.
Deferral Plan. As part of planning for retirement or other long-term financial needs, the Company provides the U.S. NEOs and certain other senior-level U.S.- paid employees with an annual opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their base salary or annual cash incentive award up to one times their base salary. Under the Deferral Plan, certain participants may elect for payment to commence upon separation from service or a specified date at least five years after deferral, but not later than separation from service, and to receive payment in either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of five, ten or 15 consecutive years. For 2007 and prior years, participants were able to defer receipt until termination of employment or a specified date at least five years after deferral, but not later than ten years after termination of employment.
Deferral Plan Earnings. Starting January 1, 2011, earnings for U.S.-paid NEOs on deferral balances are based on investment options similar to those offered under the RSP (other than the Company Stock Fund and the Self-Directed Brokerage Account). Furthermore, for participants, including NEOs, with pre-2011 balances, the Deferral Plan was amended to allow for an additional investment option that provides a market interest rate based on 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate for December of the preceding year. Interest crediting on deferrals was previously based on ROE-linked interest crediting schedules.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or CIC
The tables below show certain potential payments that would have been made to an NEO if the NEO's employment had terminated on December 31, 2018, under various scenarios, including a CIC. The tables do not include the pension benefits nor nonqualified deferred compensation that would be paid to an NEO, which are set forth in the Pension Benefits 2018 and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 2018 tables above, except to the extent that the NEO is entitled to an additional benefit as a result of the termination. In addition, the tables do not include the value of vested but unexercised SOs as of December 31, 2018. The footnotes to the tables describe the assumptions used in estimating the amounts shown in the tables.
Because the payments to be made to an NEO depend on several factors, the actual amounts to be paid out upon an NEO's termination of employment can only be determined at the time of an executive's actual separation from the Company. Additionally, to protect shareholders and our business model, executives are required to comply with non-compete, non-solicitation and certain other provisions during any period of time they receive severance.

Equity Compensation Plans
The following table provides summary information with respect to the Company's equity compensation plans under which the Company's common shares may be issued to employees or non-employees (such as consultants or advisors) as of December 31, 2018, each of which was approved by shareholders. Information relating to employee stock purchase plans and employee savings plans (such as 401(k) plans) is not included. Information is provided in the aggregate for the Company's equity compensation plans which have been approved by the Company's shareholders. There are no such plans that have not been approved by shareholders.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Pay Ratio
Our CEO to median compensated employee pay ratio is 306:1, with the 2018 Total Compensation number for Mr. Squeri being $17,353,942 and the equivalent number for the identified median employee being $56,756. Since the Company had two CEOs in 2018, we annualized the compensation of Mr. Squeri, who was CEO on November 30, 2018, which results in a 2018 total compensation number that is $12,500 higher than the total compensation for Mr. Squeri in the Summary Compensation Table. To calculate the annual total compensation for the identified median employee, we used the same methodology as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement and did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to their total compensation.
We used the same median employee in our pay ratio calculation for 2018 as we used in 2017 because there has been no change in our employee population or compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure.

Shareholder Proposals
Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave, 2M Great Neck, NY 11021, has advised that he is the owner of not less than 100 common shares and that he intends for Mr. John Chevedden to introduce the following proposal on his behalf:
Item 4 — Right to Act by Written Consent
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law.
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle.
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if all shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice.
Taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. A shareholder right to act by written consent and to call a special meeting are 2 complimentary ways to bring an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. More than 100 Fortune 500 companies provide for shareholders to call special meetings and to act by written consent.
Written consent is a means to elect a director who could focus on the wisdom of stock repurchases:
Announcement of share repurchase authorization of up to $3.4 Billion in common shares July 2018
There is a concern about share repurchases like the above. Stock buybacks can be a sign of short—termism for executives—sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the company. A dollar spent repurchasing a share is a dollar that cannot be spent on new equipment, an acquisition, entry into a new market or anything else.
Written consent is a means to elect a director who could focus on avoiding reoccurrences of events like these:
FBI Investigation over alleged misrepresentation of foreign exchange rates September 2018
Criticism over alleged role in offshore tax havens January 2018
$2.6 billion charge announced January 2018
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management. Our Directors and management will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus be more alert in avoiding poor performance.
Please vote yes: Right to Act by Written Consent—Proposal 4
Table of Contents
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition
Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal because:
Our Board has carefully reviewed this proposal and continues to believe that implementation of this proposal is unnecessary, given the ability of shareholders to call special meetings which allow for shareholder action between annual meetings in an orderly and equitable manner. As permitted by New York State law, the Company's bylaws provide that shareholders holding 25% or more of the Company's outstanding common shares may call a special meeting. The right to call a special meeting is a fair and transparent mechanism for shareholders to consider important matters. Our Board continues to believe that the 25% ownership requirement for the right of shareholders to call special meetings is a reasonable and appropriate balance between enhancing shareholder rights and protecting against the risk that a small minority of shareholders could initiate actions that are not in the best interests of the majority of our shareholders.
Currently, shareholders may propose any proper matter for a vote either through a special meeting or at our annual meeting. Implementation of this proposal, by contrast, could permit fundamental corporate changes to occur outside of a meeting and without advance notice to all shareholders or time for thoughtful consideration and deliberation. Our Board believes that permitting action at a meeting (whether the annual meeting or a special meeting) is a more transparent and equitable process than the action by written consent process as it provides all shareholders the opportunity to participate and vote. Meetings are held at a time, date and venue announced publicly in advance, and all shareholders receive prior notice of the meeting and are invited to attend, vote in person or by proxy, and make their views known. To the contrary, the shareholder proposal would allow shareholders owning slightly over 50% of the Company's outstanding shares to act on a significant matter without prior notice of the meeting to all shareholders and without affording all shareholders the opportunity to have a meaningful and structured exchange of views. This would disenfranchise shareholders who are not given the chance to participate. In addition, the action by written consent process could create substantial confusion and inefficiency for a widely held public company like American Express. Under the proposal, multiple shareholders could circulate duplicative or contradictory written consents at the same time, creating substantial confusion and disruption among shareholders. Such a disjointed process would not permit orderly debates on the merits of proposed actions. This disordered state of corporate affairs would impose significant administrative and financial burdens on the Company, while providing little or no corresponding benefit to shareholders.
Additionally, our Board believes that the strong corporate governance processes in place at the Company make the adoption of this shareholder proposal unnecessary. In addition to the special meeting right highlighted above, certain of our corporate governance practices and policies that serve to enhance Board accountability include:

Board Recommendation
In summary, our Board believes that the implementation of this shareholder proposal is not in the best interests of shareholders or the Company and is unnecessary, given the ability of shareholders to call special meetings and the Company's strong corporate governance practices and policies. Further, this shareholder proposal would circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all shareholders by shareholder meetings.
For the reasons described above, our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.

Myra K. Young, 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, CA 95758, has advised that she is the owner of 50 common shares and that she intends for Mr. John Chevedden to introduce the following proposal on her behalf:
Item 5 – Deduct Stock Buyback Impact from Executive Pay
Resolved: Shareholders of American Express Company ("Company") ask the Board of Directors to adopt a policy that it will not utilize "earnings per share" ("EPS") in determining senior executive incentive compensation or eligibility for such compensation, unless the Board utilizes the number of outstanding shares on the beginning date of the performance period and excludes the effect of stock buybacks that occur between that date and the end of the performance period. The policy shall be implemented without violating existing contractual obligations in existence on the date this proposal is adopted.
Supporting Statement: According to last year's proxy statement, a substantial proportion of compensation to executives was based on performance targets, including earnings per share (EPS). https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4962/000120677418000866/amex3289431-def14a.htm#exec_compensation
Alignment of senior executive pay with long-term sustainable growth may not exist if a company is using earnings per share or certain financial return ratios to calculate incentive pay awards when the company is aggressively repurchasing its shares or if senior executives use the jump in stock price resulting from a buyback announcement as a chance to sell stock intended to incentivize long-term performance.
Research by Robert Ayres and Michael Olenick of INSEAD found "the more capital a business invests in buying its own stock, expressed as a ratio of capital invested in buybacks to current market capitalization, the less likely that company is to experience long-term growth in overall market value. [Secular Stagnation (Or Corporate Suicide?) https://ruayres.wordpress.com/2017/07/11/secular-stagnation-or-corporate-suicide]
"Twice as many companies have insiders selling in the eight days after a buyback announcement as sell on an ordinary day." [Stock Buyouts and Corporate Cashouts https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/06/13/stock-buyouts-and-corporate-cashouts/#23b] Commissioner Jackson advises that rules should be amended, "at a minimum, to deny the safe harbor to companies that choose to allow executives to cash out during a buyback."

Vote For Proposal 5 - Deduct Impact of Stock Buybacks from Executive Pay
Table of Contents
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition
The Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal because:
A primary objective of the Company and the Board is to create shareholder value and optimize long-term financial returns. In pursuit of this objective, each year management proposes a capital plan that allocates capital to support business growth, both organically and through acquisition, ensures that the Company maintains target capital levels, and returns capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve and its capital plan must be compliant with standards prescribed by the Federal Reserve. This capital plan is reviewed by the Company's Board, which has ultimate oversight responsibility for capital planning and is in the best position to make informed decisions regarding the Company's capital adequacy and capital actions, including capital distributions.
The Company's most recent capital plan, as approved by the Board and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, included, beginning in the third quarter 2018, a $0.04 increase to the Company's quarterly dividend (to $0.39 cents per share) and plans to return up to $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders over four quarters in the form of share buybacks. During this same period, management expects to allocate significant capital to support organic business growth and acquisitions. The Board believes that it is in the best position to approve a comprehensive capital plan for the Company, including determining when share buybacks are appropriate. And, as noted above, the additional oversight by the Federal Reserve ensures that the Company's capital plan is consistent with the Company's long-term health, stability and performance.
Our Board firmly believes that share buybacks, as part of a comprehensive capital program, are an effective tool for delivering value to shareholders. Rather than eroding long-term value, share buybacks create value by ensuring that excess capital is deployed effectively. By their very nature, share buybacks reduce the assets on a company's balance sheet and increase a company's return on assets. For shareholders, share buybacks increase their percentage ownership of the company's shares. For these reasons, it is consistent with shareholders' interests to maintain compensation metrics that do not disincentivize, or deduct the impact of, share buybacks executed as part of a comprehensive capital program.
Further, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (CBC) of the Board approves an overall compensation philosophy and strategy for the Company and its executive officers, including the selection of performance measures aligned with the Company's business strategy. The CBC regularly reviews the mix of executive compensation with its independent compensation consultant to ensure that executive incentives are closely aligned with shareholder interests and that the Company's financial performance metrics are within market norms for peer companies. As disclosed in the Company's 2018 proxy statement, the Company's executive compensation program includes various components and performance metrics. For example, payout of the annual incentive award for 2017 performance took into account performance relative to the metrics of revenue growth, net promoter score, diversity and inclusions goals, and merchant and lending growth, in addition to earnings per share. Also, 2017 metrics for the long-term incentive award include three-year cumulative EPS, strategic milestones and three-year average ROE. The same holds true for the 2018 executive compensation program. The metric of EPS is only one part of a comprehensive compensation program that is designed to link executives' pay to the Company's performance over the long term. The CBC and the Board strongly believe that any limitation on its ability to utilize the most appropriate performance metrics for a given point in time would not be in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders.
Finally, the CBC considers the Company's capital plan, including planned share buybacks, when designing the Company's executive compensation program and setting EPS performance targets, and the impact of potential share buybacks is taken into account.
Table of Contents
Board Recommendation
Our Board believes that given that (i) the capital plan, including share buybacks, is approved by the Board and regulated by the Federal Reserve and (ii) the potential impact of share buybacks on EPS is considered by the CBC when setting EPS performance targets, there is no ability for executives to implement or carry out a share buyback program for personal incentive reasons.
For the reasons described above, our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.

Arjuna Capital, 1 Elm Street, Manchester, MA 01944, on behalf of its client Lauren Jane McMahon, has advised that their client is the owner of 66 common shares and that she intends for Arjuna Capital to introduce the following proposal on her behalf:
Item 6 — Gender Pay Equity
Gender Pay Equity
Whereas: The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy 1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of their male counterparts. This disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career. The gap for African American and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059.
United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs, but mostly ignore median pay gaps. The United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. And while American Express reported a 19.1 percent median pay gap for its United Kingdom operations, it has not published median information for its global operations.
American Express has committed to report compensation received by women compared to men on a statistically adjusted equal pay basis. Yet, that statistically adjusted number alone fails to consider how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. In contrast, median pay gap disclosures address the structural bias that affects the jobs women hold, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs.
Women account for 51 percent of our company's global workforce, but only 24 percent of executive leadership. Mercer finds female executives are 20 to 30 percent more likely to leave financial services careers than other careers. Actively managing pay equity "is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation."
Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, "the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling." Best practices include "tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps."
Public policy risk is of concern, not only in the United Kingdom where our Company has stated "we fully support the Government's efforts to highlight and address any gender equality issues." In the United States, the Paycheck Fairness Act pends before Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened equal pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination.
Resolved: Shareholders request American Express report on the risks to the company associated with emerging public policies addressing the gender pay gap, including associated reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information.
The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).
Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation.
Table of Contents
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition
The Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal because the information the Company releases on pay equity and diversity of workforce representation as well as our programs and initiatives, taken together, are more informative to our stakeholders than the statistics requested in the proposal and because our ongoing pay equity reviews, programs and practices protect the Company from material risks associated with emerging public policies addressing the gender pay gap.
The Company is and has long been committed to helping our people become great leaders, providing a world of opportunities to grow their careers, and creating an inclusive and diverse culture to help them thrive. We foster a workplace culture where differences are valued and expressed freely and all employees have the support they need to take risks, learn, and collaborate. To achieve this:
2018 Pay Equity Review: Key Findings
The review covered the top 10 markets where we do business (which cover more than 90% of our workforce) and we extended the analysis to include minorities in the U.S. The analysis concluded:
The review looked at a number of factors known to drive compensation, including role, level, geography, performance and tenure before assessing whether there were any pay gaps. Results were communicated internally and externally and, where countries have disclosure requirements mandated by regulators, we will meet our obligations. The findings of this review demonstrate that the Company has been effectively managing pay equity and, as outlined below, has practices and policies in place to facilitate the professional growth of women in our workforce.
Women's Advancement at American Express
In addition to our compensation practices, we recognize the critical need to create opportunities and promote/assist in the advancement and retention of women globally. Externally, we support groundbreaking research for women's career development with the Center for Talent Innovation, and internally, we ensure that our women colleagues are given the tools, resources, and sponsorship they need to succeed.
In May 2018, over 170 senior women leaders from across the globe came together in New York City, joining our Chairman and CEO Steve Squeri and our Executive Committee for our two-day Global Women's Conference. Focused on leadership, the discussions and panels were aimed at helping participants gain a better understanding of the unique issues women leaders face and possible solutions to navigate them as well as celebrating the importance of women's individual and collective ambition. We have also hosted targeted regional Women's Conferences in Mexico and India, focused on career progression guidance, developing resiliency, being an effective protegée, and building the leadership behaviors and mindset to advance at the Company. Following the Global Women's Conference, our senior most leaders have continued to drive a broad women's agenda to increase the engagement, development and advance the progression of our women colleagues globally.
Table of Contents
Forums like our Global Women's Conference are critical in helping us understand what we can do differently and provide us with the opportunity to leverage the knowledge and experiences of our most senior women executives to drive lasting change for present and future generations of American Express women. The Company will be deploying the next evolution of inclusive leadership/unconscious bias training for all leaders at the vice president level and above across the globe.
Colleague Networks, formed by our colleagues and sponsored by senior business leaders, have also brought together people with shared backgrounds and interests to engage with and learn from each other. Today we have 15 such networks with nearly 100 chapters around the world, reflecting the full spectrum of diversity at the Company. Colleague Networks focused on women now comprise 32 chapters.
Additional Support for Women
We provide the support and trust our colleagues need to thrive both at work and at home by offering one of the most robust benefits suites in the industry along with flexible work arrangements. Most notably, we began offering the company's U.S.-based regular full-time and part-time colleagues 20 weeks of paid parental leave, which covers women and men welcoming a child through birth, adoption and surrogacy. We believe longer parental leave has a far-reaching positive impact on both colleague health and women's career advancement.
Board Recommendation
Our Board believes that our ongoing pay equity reviews, programs and practices protect the Company from the material risks associated with emerging public policies addressing the gender pay gap. Further, our Board believes that, taken together, the information we release on pay equity and diversity of workforce representation as well as our programs and initiatives to further the advancement of women are more informative to our stakeholders than the statistics requested in the proposal.
For the reasons described above, our Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.

Quorum and Required Vote
We will have a quorum and will be able to conduct the business of the annual meeting if the holders of a majority of the votes that shareholders are entitled to cast are present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. For the 2019 annual meeting, to elect directors and adopt the other proposals, the following votes are required under our governing documents and New York State law:
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  A broker non-vote occurs when a broker submits a proxy but does not vote for an item because it is not a "routine" item and the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. As described under Effect of Not Casting Your Vote, your broker may vote in its discretion only on Item 2, Ratification of appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
**  Advisory/Non-binding 
[END TABLE]
There are no cumulative voting rights. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals. If any other matter comes before the meeting, the named proxies will use their best judgment in voting the proxies.
Multiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Address
We are sending only one notice or one proxy statement and annual report to the address of multiple shareholders unless we have received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," reduces duplicate mailings, saving paper and reducing printing costs. If any shareholder residing at such an address wishes to receive an individual copy of the materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of our proxy statement and annual report and would like to enroll in this service, please contact the Company's Corporate Secretary (see page 30 for contact information).

Other Shareholder Proposals for Presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting
Under our bylaws, shareholders must follow certain advance notice procedures to nominate a person for election as a director at an annual or special meeting, or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting. Under these advance notice procedures, shareholders must submit the proposed nominee or item of business by delivering a notice to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices. We must receive notice as follows:
Our bylaws provide that notice of a proposed nomination must include certain information about the shareholder and the nominee, as well as a written consent of the proposed nominee to serve if elected. A notice of a proposed item of business must include a description of and the reasons for bringing the proposed business to the meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in the business and certain other information about the shareholder. Any notice (other than a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8) that is received outside of the window specified above for proposed items of business will be considered untimely under Rule 14a-4(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The persons named in the proxy for the meeting may exercise their discretionary voting power with respect to all such matters, including voting against them.
All director nominations and shareholder proposals, other than shareholder proposals made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, must comply with the requirements of the Company's bylaws. You may obtain a copy of the Company's bylaws at no cost from the Company's Corporate Secretary (see below for contact information).
