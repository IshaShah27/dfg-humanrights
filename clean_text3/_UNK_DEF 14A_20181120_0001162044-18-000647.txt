[END TABLE]
The Company does not pay any other compensation or any pension (retirement) benefits to any directors or officers. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board of Directors as a whole performs the functions of an audit committee, nominating committee and compensation committee. The Company believes that this is appropriate due to its small size and that more than ninety-three percent (93%) of the outstanding voting stock is owned by members of the Keywell family. The Board of Directors does not have an audit committee charter, a nominating committee charter or a compensation committee charter. The Board has established a committee composed of the officers of the Fund to consider (1) the purchase of any bond that does not meet the general guidelines approved for bond purchases, and (2) the sale of any bond where the quality rating of the bond has fallen. 
Board Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board of Directors considers oversight of the Fund's risk management efforts to be a responsibility of the entire Board. This includes oversight of the Fund's independent registered public accountants and establishment of appropriate policies for the Fund. With regard to the Fund's investment risk management, the Board has established a committee composed of the officers of the Fund to consider (1) the purchase of any bond that does not meet the general guidelines approved for bond purchases, and (2) the sale of any bond where the quality rating of the bond has fallen. The committee also receives periodic reports on any bonds that the Board or the committee considers to be deserving of additional scrutiny. 
The Fund has no employees. Accounting and administrative services for the Fund are provided under a contract for a fixed, stated fee, not a performance-based fee. Therefore, this contract does not encourage excessive risk-taking that could have an adverse impact on the Fund. 
Nominating Process  The Board of Directors as a whole is responsible for the selection and nomination of directors. The Company does not retain a third party to assist in the identification of directors. The Board of Directors does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by shareholders. The Board of Directors will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders and therefore it does not believe that a formal policy is necessary. The Board of Directors as a whole selected and approved the director nominees contained in this proxy statement. 
When seeking to identify an individual to become a director, the Board of Directors will consult with incumbent directors, management and others. The Board of Directors will consider, among other factors, the background and reputation of potential candidates in terms of character, personal and professional integrity, business and financial experience and acumen, how a person would complement the other directors in providing a diversity of expertise and experience and a person's availability to devote sufficient time to Board of Director duties. Although the Board of Directors has no formal policy with regard to diversity, the Board believes that it functions best when its membership reflects a range of expertise so that the Board as a whole reflects diverse but complementary skills and viewpoints. 
To recommend a nominee, shareholders should write to the Company's Secretary c/o Keyco Bond Fund, Inc., 27777 Franklin Road, Suite 1630, Southfield, Michigan 48034. To be considered by the Board of Directors for nomination and inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder recommendation for a director must be received by the Company's Secretary no later than July 23, 2019. Any recommendation must include (i) the name and address of the candidate, (ii) a brief biographical description, including his or her occupation for at least the last five years, and a statement of the qualifications of the candidate, taking into account the qualification requirements summarized above, and (iii) the candidate's signed consent to be named in the proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected. 
Assuming the appropriate background material is provided for candidates submitted by shareholders, the process followed by the Board of Directors to identify and evaluate candidates described above will be used to evaluate those candidates submitted by shareholders and the Board of Directors will apply substantially the same criteria. 
Communications with Directors 
Stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors or any individual director by sending a letter to Keyco Bond Fund, Inc., 27777 Franklin Road, Suite 1630, Southfield, Michigan, 48034, Attn: Presiding Director (or any individual director). The Secretary will receive the correspondence and forward it to the presiding director or to any individual director or directors to whom the communication is directed. The Secretary is authorized to review, sort and summarize all communications received prior to their presentation to the presiding director or to whichever director(s) the communication is addressed. If such communications are not a proper matter for Board attention, such individuals are authorized to direct such communication to the appropriate department. For example, stockholder requests for materials or information will be directed to investor relations personnel. 
Information Concerning Investment Matters 
Determination Not to Use Investment Adviser; Termination of Investment Advisory Contract 
The Board of Directors has decided not to retain the services of an outside investment adviser and, instead, has authorized the officers of the Company, with review provided by the interested directors of the Company (Thomas E. Purther, Ellen T. Horing and Michael Pullman), to make investment decisions internally. 
The Board's decision not to retain the services of an investment adviser was made after careful deliberation and was based upon several factors, including the following: 
 The Company's investment objectives are relatively clear-cut and uncomplicated. The Company's primary investment objective, as reported in prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is "to receive as high a level of current interest income exempt from federal income taxes as is available from Municipal Bonds (as defined therein) and as is consistent with prudent investment  management and preservation of capital, and capital appreciation will be a minor investment objective of the Company." As a result of this objective, the Company invests in high quality bonds which typically have relatively low turnover.
 Given the relatively low turnover in investment securities, the Board has been able to closely monitor the investment activity of the Company.
 The fees charged by potential third party investment advisers were relatively high and, in light of the net benefit to be provided to the Company, unacceptable
The Company has entered into a Custodial Account Agreement with Comerica Bank pursuant to which the Bank provides certain custodial account services for the Company. 
Portfolio — Brokerage Allocation and Transactions 
The Company's investment portfolio has consisted of, and will continue to consist of, debt obligations issued by states, counties, cities and their political subdivisions or agencies, the interest on which is exempt from federal income tax in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer ("Municipal Bonds"). Municipal Bonds are normally traded in the over-the-counter market on a net basis (without commissions) through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. Because of this fact, there are no stated commissions charged with respect to trades for transactions in the Company's portfolio securities. 
When purchasing or selling Municipal Bonds, the Company seeks to obtain the prompt execution of orders at the most favorable prices available. To the extent that, in the Company's experience, the execution capabilities and prices offered by more than one dealer have been comparable, the Company may, in its discretion, choose to purchase and sell Municipal Bonds from and to dealers who provide research, statistical and other information to the Company. However, it is not the Company's policy to pay a higher price to a dealer solely because it has supplied these services. Although this type of information is useful to the Company, it is believed that such services will not reduce the Company's normal research activities. The Company believes that the types of research services and information which will be provided by dealers will consist principally of research reports on particular issues of Municipal Bonds and technical information concerning general market conditions for Municipal Bonds. 
Section 16 Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Under the federal securities laws, the Company's directors, its executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock (collectively, the "Reporting Persons") are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to provide the Company with copies of same, relative to their ownership of the Common Stock, which reports need to be filed at such time as they first become a Reporting Person and at such time or times as any changes occur in their beneficial ownership of the Common Stock. Specific due dates for filing these reports have been established and the Company is required to disclose in this Proxy Statement any failure to timely file these reports. 
Based upon representations and copies of reports furnished to the Company by Reporting Persons, all Section 16 reporting requirements applicable to Reporting Persons for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were satisfied on a timely basis. 
Other Matters and Shareholder Proposals 
At the date of this Proxy Statement, management is not aware of any matters to be presented for action at the meeting other than those described above. However, if any other matters should come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy card to vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters. 
Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2019 annual meeting which are eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for that meeting under Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), must be received by the Company at its principal executive offices  no later than July 23, 2019. Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2019 annual meeting which are not eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for that meeting under Rule 14a-8 are considered untimely under Rule 14a-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act unless received by the Company at its principal executive offices no later than October 6, 2019, and the Company expects the persons named as proxies for the 2019 annual meeting to use their discretionary voting authority with respect to any proposal considered untimely at the 2019 annual meeting.
