As of the date of this proxy statement, our Board of Directors is composed of seven members who are divided into two classes with overlapping two-year terms. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have four Class I directors and three Class II directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors is elected for a term of two years to succeed those directors whose terms expire on the annual meeting date. A director serves in office until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her death or resignation. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the two classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of an equal number of directors. Any vacancy occurring mid-term will be filled by a majority of the other current members of the Board of Directors. There is no family relationship between any of our directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nominees     Three Class II directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting for a two-year term  ending in 2021. Based upon the recommendation of our Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, our Board has nominated: Emiko Higashi, Sanjay Saraf and Eric Stang for election as Class II directors.   If any of these nominees is unable or declines to serve as a  director at the time of the Annual Meeting, proxies will be voted for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board of Directors.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight      Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the Chairperson of the Board not be the CEO of the Company. In  addition, while the Chairperson works closely with the CEO and other members of our management, the Chairperson is not part of management and does not have an operating or external role or responsibility. The Board of Directors considers it useful  and appropriate to designate a Chairperson to act as the presiding director at Board of Directors meetings, to call and organize such meetings and manage the agenda thereof, and to manage the affairs of the Board of Directors, including ensuring  that the Board of Directors is organized properly, functions effectively, and meets its obligations and responsibilities. The Chairperson also acts as the principal contact for the CEO and other members of the Board of Directors and management, as  appropriate, for matters requiring the attention of the full Board of Directors. We believe that this leadership structure is appropriate given the attention, time, effort, and energy that the CEO is required to dedicate to his position in the  current business environment, and the high level of commitment required to serve as our Chairperson. The Board of Directors plays an integral role in our risk oversight processes.   The Board of Directors meets regularly to receive reports from  its committees, as well as from management with respect to areas of material risk to the Company, including legal, operational, financial and strategic risks. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees and reviews at least annually our risk  management policies, including our investment policies.

 PROPOSAL TWO: 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
We are asking our stockholders to provide an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative disclosures as described in this Proxy Statement. The Company currently holds such an advisory vote annually, and this proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
Please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, the compensation tables and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables for greater detail about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our named executive officers. 
We believe that our overall compensation program and philosophy support and help drive the Company's long- term value creation, business strategy and operating performance objectives. We are again asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement by voting "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
While this say-on-pay vote is advisory and does not bind the Company to any particular action, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value your opinion. Accordingly, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for the Company's named executive officers. 
Approval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  PROPOSAL THREE:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Laura Stark, former Senior Vice President, GM, Emerging Solutions.  
[END TABLE]
Except where noted, references in our CD&A to NEOs include references to Mr. Black and Ms. Stark during their time as executive officers. 
Our CD&A is organized as follows: (i) Executive Summary, (ii) 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and Other Stockholder Engagement, (iii) Our Compensation Philosophy — Pay for Performance, (iv) NEO Compensation Process, (v) Components of NEO Compensation, (vi) 2018 CEO Transition, (vii) Fiscal 2019 Executive Compensation, and (viii) Other Policies and Elements of NEO Compensation. 
Executive Summary 
CEO Transition 
During June 2018, the Rambus Board terminated the employment of our former CEO, Ronald Black. Mr. Black received no separation pay from the Company and forfeited all unvested outstanding equity awards in connection with and as a result of his termination. The Board then appointed Luc Seraphin, the then Senior Vice President & General Manager, Memory and Interfaces Division, as interim CEO of the Company, effective immediately while the Board commenced a formal search to identify a new CEO for the Company. After an exhaustive search involving several external finalist candidates, Mr. Seraphin was identified as the best choice to lead Rambus. Additionally, the Company had made notable progress during Mr. Seraphin's tenure as Interim CEO. Accordingly, Mr. Seraphin was appointed President and CEO of Rambus by the Board effective October 25, 2018. 
Executive Compensation Highlights 
Our compensation programs are designed to align compensation with business objectives and Company financial performance. The objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executives in order to enhance the long-term profitability of the Company, foster stockholder value creation, and align executives' interests with those of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation levels annually and seeks to reward executives for performance of achievement against corporate, business unit, department and individual goals. In its annual executive compensation review, the Compensation Committee also relies on compensation survey and peer company data and considers a balance between pay for performance and retention of executives in a competitive labor market. The items below highlight key components of our executive compensation program and philosophy in fiscal 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We made significant changes to our 2018 compensation programs to better align with best practices and respond to extensive stockholder outreach and  feedback following our Say on Pay votes in April 2017 and April 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result of our discussions with stockholders during fiscal 2017 and early 2018, our 2018 and beyond performance-based equity compensation awards  are robustly aligned with stockholder interests in that they vest only after meeting challenging targets for compound annual growth in revenue over a three-year period and are further modified by total stockholder return over the same period.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result of our discussions with stockholders during late fiscal 2017 and early fiscal 2018, the compensation of our new CEO was evaluated against  current market survey data and analysis of internal pay equity, resulting in more modest CEO market positioning and compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation mix is weighed more heavily toward performance-based compensation. Approximately 80% of our current CEO's total target  compensation, and on average, approximately 75% of our other NEOs' total target compensation was subject to our financial and/or share price performance in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To further align executive compensation with stockholder interests, approximately 80% of our former CEO's target long-term equity incentive awards  and 60% of our 2018 NEOs' (including our current CEO's) target long-term equity incentive awards consisted of performance units as described below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual incentive compensation program ("Corporate Incentive Plan" or "CIP") is robustly aligned with Company performance. Our  CIP program is funded based on the achievement of an objective performance target of pro-forma operating income.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During 2018 we exceeded a more rigorous performance target of $133M in pro-forma operating income, relative to  the 2017 goal of $117M and actual performance of $124M, by achieving pro forma operating income of $135M, resulting in 101% CIP pool funding.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee believes that the executive compensation program at Rambus is a multi-year process and continues to work to ensure that the  program attracts, retains, motivates and rewards executives in order to enhance the long-term profitability of the Company, fosters stockholder value creation, and aligns executives' interests with those of the Company's stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We maintained high governance standards in our executive compensation practices, including best practices with respect to minimum equity ownership  guidelines, perquisites, compensation recovery (clawback) and independent compensation committee advisors. See "Other Policies and Elements of NEO Compensation" below.

Summary of Our Business Performance 
Over the past several years, Rambus has transitioned from a pure IP licensing model to one that delivers increasing value to the market through products, such as chips, customizable IP cores, and software and services. In line with our growth strategy, we acquired four businesses in 2016 in the fields of mobile payments, smart ticketing, memory buffer chips and SerDes IP cores, and continued to integrate those businesses in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. In fiscal 2018, we also continued to execute on our traditional patent licensing business by signing key licensing agreements with Broadcom, NVIDIA, Micron, IBM, Infineon and others, demonstrating our ability to extend our partnerships beyond the DRAM industry. 
Below are business and financial highlights from fiscal 20181: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record server DIMM chip revenue of $36M  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record IP cores revenue with wins at Tier 1 data center and communications customers

For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in this CD&A, please see our fourth quarter and  fiscal year 2018 financial results release dated January 28, 2019. For purposes of the following financial highlights, Rambus has included financial results under ASC 606 along with results that would have been applicable under ASC 605. The ASC  605 information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor superior to, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared in accordance with ASC 606. Rambus notes that this presentation allows a more relevant  comparability with prior results, which were all reported under ASC 605.

2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and Other Stockholder Engagement 
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we obtained approximately 48% of the votes cast and therefore we did not obtain stockholder approval concerning the advisory vote on executive compensation. This result, as well as our 2017 annual meeting result for the advisory vote on executive compensation, was well below our desired level and sent a strong message to the Company. During the past twenty-four months, we have engaged in significant stockholder outreach and made meaningful changes to our executive compensation programs to better align our compensation practices with leading market practices and what we believe to be in the best interest of our stockholders and the long-term sustainability of the Company. During our 2017-2018 campaign and during our 2018-2019 campaign, we have held ongoing discussions with stockholders representing approximately 70% of our total shares outstanding. Following our 2017-2018 discussions with stockholders, we were able to implement several compensation design changes. The majority of these changes took effect for fiscal 2018. We continued to engage with stockholders on the topic of executive compensation during the fall of 2018 and early 2019 and have further revised our executive compensation program to better align pay for performance. The table below shows the most important feedback that we received from our stockholders and how we have responded. We will hold say-on-pay votes annually, as approved by our stockholders in a non-binding advisory vote at our 2017 annual meeting. We are holding a say-on-pay vote at the 2019 annual meeting and intend to do so again at our 2020 annual meeting. 
We continue to take stockholder feedback seriously, and we acknowledge our long-term commitment to continuing to improve our pay programs to align pay and performance, and to support the Company's strategic efforts.

In addition to the changes presented above, the Company continues to ensure that our executive compensation policies and practices align with leading corporate governance policies. 
Our Compensation Philosophy — Pay for Performance 
Our compensation programs are designed to align compensation with business objectives and Company financial performance. The objectives of our executive compensation program are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executives in order to enhance the long-term profitability of the Company, foster stockholder value creation, and align executives' interests with those of our stockholders. The principal components of our annual executive compensation program in 2018 were base salary, annual cash incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards. 
A substantial portion of our executive' total compensation is variable and dependent on Company and individual performance. In fiscal 2018, approximately 67% of our current CEO's, and on average 55% of our NEOs' total target compensation was subject to stock price performance.  Below is a chart showing target variable versus fixed pay and target annual versus long-term pay for our current NEOs, including our current CEO, for 2018:

NEO Compensation Process 
The Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining and approving CEO compensation, approving compensation recommendations for NEOs, recommending to the Board changes to the non-employee director compensation program, approving the overall levels of equity to be granted each year, and determining the amount of funding that will be available for CIP, among other duties expressed in its charter. The compensation decisions are based on numerous inputs and independent advice, as laid out below. 
In performing these duties, the Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of the CEO, and reviews and evaluates the existing NEO compensation programs. The Compensation Committee has the authority to obtain   advice and assistance from internal or external compensation consultants, attorneys, accountants and other advisers. The Board of Directors annually evaluates the independence of its members and has determined that each non-executive member of the Board of Directors satisfies the relevant criteria for independence. 
The Compensation Committee considers multiple factors to ensure that compensation packages are consistent with our pay for performance philosophy and that we remain competitive in the market for talent. Important factors considered in these decision-making processes included Company performance, individual leadership and performance assessments, market compensation levels, job scope, individual skills and experience, the relative importance of the individual's role, internal pay equity, historical pay levels and equity holdings. 
The Board of Directors completed an annual comprehensive performance assessment of the NEOs and conducted a review of the CEO's performance. This assessment included an evaluation of pre-established strategic objectives and review of direct feedback from managers, peers and subordinates. The Compensation Committee also held an annual joint meeting with the full Board of Directors to review and discuss Company leadership development, performance objectives and emergency and long-term succession planning. 
The Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to retain Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("SBCG") to assist in evaluating executive and director compensation. In addition, SBCG prepared materials and analyses for the Compensation Committee on CEO compensation, including both Mr. Black's fiscal 2018 compensation, as well as Mr. Seraphin's interim CEO compensation and CEO promotion compensation. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved both Mr. Black's compensation and Mr. Seraphin's compensation, and neither Mr. Black nor Mr. Seraphin was present for any voting or deliberations regarding their compensation. SBCG reports directly to the Compensation Committee and works collaboratively with management and the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to SEC rules, the Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of SBCG, and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent SBCG from independently representing the Compensation Committee. SBCG does not perform other services for the Company and will not do so without the prior consent of the Compensation Committee. SBCG regularly meets with the Compensation Committee outside the presence of management. 
The Role of Management 
Each year, the CEO and the head of Human Resources present to the Compensation Committee annual performance reviews and compensation recommendations for the then-current NEOs, excluding the CEO. Evaluation of CEO performance and compensation is determined by the Compensation Committee without the presence or consultation of the CEO. Management personnel work with SBCG to prepare compensation information and assessments for the Compensation Committee's consideration. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee also determines the amount of funding available for our CIP pool. Our CEO then allocates this funding based on a measurement of each NEO's achievement levels against specific performance milestones in relation to the Company's overall performance targets and recommends a specific CIP award for each NEO other than himself. The Compensation Committee reviews and assesses the CEO's proposed CIP award for each NEO. 
Peer Group Comparisons 
Each year, SBCG, together with senior members of our Human Resources department, defines and assesses the appropriateness of a group of similarly situated companies, referred to as the Compensation Peer Group, for purposes of assisting the Compensation Committee to determine whether the total compensation opportunity available to our NEOs is appropriate and competitive.  As Rambus has refocused to deliver value in high growth markets through innovative product portfolios and supporting IP development, it has become increasingly difficult to select suitable peer companies. Rambus' addition of end-user markets such as data center and mobile edge business technologies, and expansion into new areas, such as Internet of Things (IoT), device security and smart transport make it an increasingly unique company. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the Company's peer group annually to ensure that the group remains appropriate, by size and business fit. The Compensation Peer Group for fiscal year 2018 compensation was approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2017 and consisted of 14 companies selected based on a number of key attributes, including revenue, technological complexity, industry and business characteristics, market capitalization and number of employees. Appearing below is the Company's fiscal year 2018 peer group as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
The fiscal year 2018 peer group spans system software, semiconductor products, technology licensing and patent licensing sectors, as shown below: 
In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews Radford survey data, including a broad range of industry competitors to supplement the peer group information. The survey was selected to represent pay levels for positions of comparable responsibility within companies of comparable size to Rambus. 
During July 2018, the Compensation Committee made further changes to the Company's peer group aimed at better positioning Rambus in terms of relative size by revenue, with such change to be effective for fiscal 2019. Accordingly, Dolby Laboratories and Integrated Device Technology, the Company's two largest peers, were removed for fiscal year 2019, and Neophotonics, Ambarella, Nanometrics and Rudolph Technologies, were added to the peer group, given their relative size in revenue.

Annual Base Salary 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved increases in base salary for Mr. Seraphin to reflect individual performance and a review of market compensation levels. Mr. Seraphin also received a base salary increase upon his promotion to Interim CEO and then again upon his promotion to CEO to reflect individual performance, increased responsibilities and market compensation levels. During 2018, Messrs. Mathur and Kim also received increases to their base salaries, reflecting individual performance, increased responsibilities and a review of market compensation levels. Prior to their departures, as a matter of normal course, Ms. Stark also received an adjustment to base salary based on individual performance and a review of market compensation levels, but Mr. Black did not, primarily based on market compensation data and the Compensation Committee's desire to   place more emphasis on performance compensation. The following shows the NEOs base salary amounts for 2018, including the percentage change from the prior fiscal year:

Annual Cash Incentive Compensation — Corporate Incentive Plan (CIP) 
Given the continued evolution of our compensation programs and changes in accounting rules effective for 2018, we made design changes to our fiscal 2018 CIP program. 
Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ("ASC 606"), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition ("ASC 605"). While the Company has seen the adoption of ASC 606 materially impact the timing of revenue recognition for its fixed-fee intellectual property licensing arrangements, the Company has not experienced a material impact on its cashflow from operations or the underlying financial position of the Company. Under the new accounting rules, while it is likely that the Company's reported revenue will be more volatile, the Company does not expect changes to the timing of billings or cash collection from its licensing arrangements. 
Consistent with previous years, the Company's fiscal year 2018 CIP program was based on the achievement of an objective performance goal of pro-forma operating income. The Company believes this measure provides a meaningful measure of core financial performance that promotes growth and cost discipline. Pro-forma operating income is a non-GAAP measure that consists of GAAP operating income, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, amortization expense, certain acquisition related expenses, retention bonuses, restructuring expenses, impairment charges, non-cash interest expense and certain other one-time or extraordinary expenses or credits. Other one-time or extraordinary expense or income items may be excluded from pro-forma operating income as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
In addition, to compensate for the recent changes in accounting rules, the fiscal year 2018 CIP achievement metric of pro forma operating income was also adjusted for Customer Licensing Income ("CLI"). CLI represents the Company's reported financial results adjusted for licensing billings. Licensing billings is an operational metric that reflects amounts invoiced to the Company's patent and technology licensing customers during the period. For example, for fiscal year 2017, licensing billings was consistent with the royalties revenue amount reported under ASC 605, though there were timing differences on a quarterly basis. As the adoption of ASC 606 was thought to materially impact the timing of revenue recognition for the Company's fixed-fee intellectual property and minimum guarantee licensing arrangements, implementing the use of the licensing billings metric as a substitute for royalty revenue in the Company's fiscal year 2018 CIP and performance unit programs, provided a measure comparable to prior periods that more closely matched the Company's cash from operations, and provided meaningful profitability metrics.  For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in CIP targets for Messrs. Seraphin, Mathur and Kim on the Compensation Committee's assessment of individual performance, responsibilities and market compensation levels. The Compensation Committee also approved an increase in CIP target percentage (100%) for Mr. Seraphin upon his promotion to Interim CEO to reflect individual performance, increased responsibilities and market compensation levels and determined that his CIP target percentage (100%) should remain at such level for the remainder of 2018 upon his promotion to CEO. Prior to their departures, as a matter of normal course, the Compensation Committee also approved adjustments to CIP targets for Mr. Black and Ms. Stark, choosing to reduce Mr. Black's CIP target percentage and slightly increasing Ms. Stark's CIP target percentage to reflect individual performance and market compensation levels. The following table shows the 2018 CIP targets relative to 2017 CIP targets for our NEOs:

Mr. Seraphin's target bonus as  CEO, effective October 25, 2018 through December 31, 2018, was $550,000. Mr. Seraphin's target bonus for the period in which he served as interim CEO was $400,000. Mr. Seraphin's target bonus for the period from the  beginning of fiscal year 2018 through his appointment as interim CEO was $330,000.

To align payouts with Company performance, CIP funding can range from 0% to 200% of target. In accordance with the plan, our 2018 CIP funding was measured at mid-year based on estimated expectations of the full year's achievement against the performance target. The measurement resulted in a progress payment toward the full year target payment. Final payments for fiscal 2018 reflected actual Company performance in 2018, net of the mid-year progress performance payment. The 2018 performance targets and results of pro-forma operating income were as follows:

Long Term Equity Incentive Compensation 
Our equity incentives encourage the achievement of superior results over time and align the interests of our executive officers and stockholders because the value of the equity incentives is based on the price of the Company's stock. Our equity awards are subject to vesting provisions to encourage executive officers to remain employed with us. To determine annual equity awards with respect to a completed fiscal year, the Compensation Committee reviews each then-current NEO's performance and contribution during such year, as well as current market information, external competitive circumstances, overall ownership and vesting schedules of existing equity held by the NEO. 
2018 Equity Awards 
NEO annual equity awards granted in February 2018 represented a mix of stock options, RSUs and performance units as an incentive for share price growth and financial performance as shown below.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that the program should be designed such that 80% of the value of the equity awards (options and performance units) granted to our then current Chief Executive Officer in February 2018 (Mr. Black) would be subject to both the risk of the Company's financial and stock performance and 60% of the value of the equity awards (options and performance units) granted to our other NEOs in February 2018 should be subject to both the risk of the Company's financial and stock performance.

 2018 Performance Units 
As a result of our stockholder engagement during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 and the continued planned evolution of our compensation programs, we made significant design changes to our fiscal year 2018 performance units. 
In fiscal 2018, the Company granted to its NEOs performance units with a three-year performance period that vest in full upon the completion of such performance period. The performance units vest based upon the achievement of Customer Licensing Income ("CLI") compound annual growth over the performance period. The initial payout will then be modified +/-25% based on the Company's TSR ranking relative to its compensation peer group. 
Compound annual CLI growth of 5% results in 50% of target payout. Each additional 1% compound annual growth results in 10% of the target number of performance units vesting, up to a maximum of 160% of target performance units at 16% compound annual growth. If compound annual CLI growth is below 5%, the performance units are forfeited. At the end of the performance period, if Rambus' TSR is in the top third of the peer group, the payout number of shares will be multiplied by 125%; middle third performance will have no additional impact on payout, and bottom third performance will have a negative 25% impact. 
Please see the chart below for an illustrative example.

A measurement of the annual CLI growth rate for 2018, the first of three years to be measured for the 2018 PSUs, was 5%.  2018 CEO Transition 
As previously disclosed, during June 2018 the Rambus Board terminated the employment of our former CEO, Ronald Black. Mr. Black received no separation pay in connection with his termination and forfeited all outstanding unvested equity awards. The Board appointed Luc Seraphin, then Senior Vice President & General Manager, Memory and Interfaces Division, as interim CEO of the Company effective immediately while the Board commenced a formal search to identify a new CEO. After an exhaustive search involving several external finalist candidates, Mr. Seraphin, who had been performing well as interim CEO, was identified as the best choice to lead Rambus and was appointed President and CEO by the Board effective October 25, 2018. Mr. Seraphin's strategic vision, leadership, and focus on execution made him the Board's choice to lead the Company to its next phase of success. Prior to his role as CEO, Mr. Seraphin served as the General Manager for Rambus' largest business unit. Mr. Seraphin's deep familiarity with Rambus and demonstrated leadership in developing the Company's go forward execution-focused strategy during his time as interim CEO allowed the Company's Board to move forward quickly in Mr. Seraphin's promotion to CEO. 
In determining Mr. Seraphin's compensation as CEO, the Compensation Committee positioned Mr. Seraphin's target total compensation in relation to the median of a competitive market for a new CEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary: $550,000  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target Annual Incentive: 100%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target Total Cash: $1.1M  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One-time RSU award valued at approximately $338,000 upon being named CEO  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual equity awards in line with the Company's annual compensation review and equity award grants  
[END TABLE]
In connection with Mr. Seraphin's promotion to Interim CEO and his promotion to CEO, the Compensation Committee made special, one-time RSU awards to Mr. Seraphin. In making such awards the Compensation Committee considered the effects the awards would have on Mr. Seraphin's retention, both during the Board's search for a new CEO and upon Mr. Seraphin's promotion to CEO. In making such awards, the Compensation Committee desired also to recognize Mr. Seraphin's performance as Interim CEO, his promotions and resulting increased level of responsibility. For Mr. Seraphin's February 2019 equity awards, the Compensation Committee increased to 60% from 50% Mr. Seraphin's performance-based RSU allocation, placing more emphasis on pay for performance. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the executive compensation program at Rambus is a multi-year process and continues to work to ensure that the program attracts, retains, motivates and rewards executives in order to enhance the long-term profitability of the Company, fosters stockholder value creation, and aligns executives' interests with those of the Company's stockholders. 
Fiscal 2019 Executive Compensation 
During January 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed base salary adjustments and annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for fiscal 2019. The principal terms and conditions of the approved plans are as outlined below. For fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee seeks to more closely align pay for performance by more closely tying executive compensation to the achievement of corporate, department and personal goals and reward high Company performers with pay above targets outlined and set by the Company.  2019 Base Salaries 
The following shows NEO base salary amounts for fiscal 2019, including the percentage change from the prior fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officers:                   
 Luc Seraphin    $ 550,000      $ 550,000        0%  
 Rahul Mathur    $ 354,188      $ 341,880        3.6%  
 Jae Kim    $ 354,188      $ 341,880        3.6%  
[END TABLE]
Changes in base salary reflect individual contributions and the Compensation Committee's review of competitive market compensation levels. 
2019 CIP 
Consistent with fiscal 2018, the Company's fiscal 2019 CIP program will be based on the achievement of the objective performance goal of pro-forma operating income, including the adjustment for CLI. The Compensation Committee believes that this metric provides a meaningful measure of core financial performance that promotes growth and cost discipline. 
The following table shows NEO 2019 CIP targets and their corresponding percentages of 2019 base salary: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officers:             
 Luc Seraphin    $ 550,000        100.00%  
 Rahul Mathur    $ 310,000        87.52%  
 Jae Kim    $ 300,000        84.70%  
[END TABLE]
2019 Equity Awards 
Based on its review of current market practices, the Compensation Committee determined that a mix of RSUs and PSUs without options would provide more appropriate incentives for Company NEOs, including the Company's CEO. NEO annual equity awards granted in February 2019 therefore represent a mix of RSUs and PSUs as an incentive for share price growth and financial performance as shown below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO      60%      40%  
 Other NEOs      50%      50%  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that the program should be designed such that 60% of the value of performance equity awards granted to our Chief Executive Officer in 2019 would be subject to both the risk of the Company's financial and stock performance and 50% of the value of performance equity awards granted to our other NEOs in 2018 should be subject to both the risk of the Company's financial and stock performance.  The following table is a summary of equity awards granted during February 2019 to our CEO and NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officers:

[BEGIN TABLE]
2   The performance unit grants will vest based upon the achievement of CLI compound annual growth over the performance period. The initial payout will  then be modified +/-25% based on the Company's TSR ranking relative to its compensation peer group and the executive's continued service to the Company through the applicable vesting date on the  third anniversary of the date of grant. Payouts range from 0% to 200%.

Other Policies and Elements of NEO Compensation 
Benefits 
We do not provide any perquisites to NEOs that are not generally available to the broad employee population with the exception of termination benefits for Mr. Seraphin and termination benefits for our NEOs, including Mr. Seraphin, based on change of control severance agreements. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan, our health and welfare benefits, our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and our User-Owned Personal Computing Devices reimbursement program on the same terms as other eligible employees. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our executives are required to hold 50% of after-tax shares realized upon vesting or exercise of equity awards on an after-tax basis until they reach the required levels of 5x base salary for the CEO and 3x base salary for other executive officers. Our executives are required to achieve the required levels within five years of the date such officer assumes his or her position. For purposes of these guidelines, ownership includes shares owned outright, unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, and the value of vested and unexercised stock options. As of December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs were in compliance with this policy, except that Jae Kim, due to market volatility in the Company's stock during the fall of 2018, was not in compliance as of such date. 
Hedging 
As stated in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, all of our employees and directors are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions in Rambus shares, including short sales and purchases of put options. 
Equity Grant Policy 
Annual equity awards to then-current NEOs are granted on February 1st of each year or the first trading day thereafter. Currently, awards granted consist of stock options, RSUs and performance units. Stock options are priced at the fair market value on the date that the grant becomes effective while RSUs and performance units are full value awards. The number of shares and key terms of the awards are approved by the Compensation Committee prior to the scheduled award date. On occasion, the Compensation Committee approves other special or promotional equity awards during the year in addition to the annual equity awards, including, for example, Mr. Seraphin's awards in connection with his promotion to Interim CEO and to CEO.  Compensation Recovery (Clawback) 
The Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce or withhold future compensation based on any required restatement or adjustment, and to determine the extent to which recovery of prior compensation may be pursued in the event of future adjustments caused by fraud on the part of an executive of Rambus. The Compensation Committee will adopt a policy that complies with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act when such rules are promulgated. 
CEO Employment Agreements 
Effective October 25, 2018, in connection with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Seraphin, which sets forth the terms and provisions governing Mr. Seraphin's employment as President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective the same date, the Company entered into an amended and restated change of control severance agreement with Mr. Seraphin. Each of the agreements will remain in effect through October 25, 2021, with automatic one-year renewal terms and each of the agreements may be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause. 
Per the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Seraphin's annual base salary was set at $550,000 and Mr. Seraphin is eligible to receive an annual incentive with a target bonus equal to 100% of his base salary. In connection with his promotion to CEO, Mr. Seraphin received an RSU award with a grant date fair value of approximately $338,000. The number of RSUs subject to the award was determined by dividing $338,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Mr. Seraphin also received an RSU award with a grant date fair value of approximately $400,000 in connection with his promotion to Interim CEO. The number of RSUs subject to this award was also determined by dividing $400,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. One hundred percent of both RSU awards vest on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Seraphin continuing to be a "Service Provider" through the vesting date. The RSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and a restricted stock unit award agreement. Per his employment agreement, Mr. Seraphin may be eligible to receive additional awards of stock options, restricted stock units, or other equity awards as determined by the Board in its discretion. 
In the event the Company terminates Mr. Seraphin's employment with the Company without "Cause" and such termination does not occur within the three months prior to or 24 months following a change of control of the Company, Mr. Seraphin will receive: (i) a lump sum payment of 100% of his base salary and target bonus, (ii) Company payment of his COBRA premiums (in lieu of continued employee benefits) for a period of 12 months, and (iii) 12 months additional vesting of all equity awards with a service based component (excluding awards with a performance-based component if the performance metric has not been achieved by the termination date).
Please see below for a description of Mr. Seraphin's amended and restated change of control agreement. 
Change of Control Severance Agreements 
We have entered into change of control severance agreements with our executive officers, including our CEO, that governs certain applicable change of control severance obligations. These agreements are designed to promote stability and retention of senior management prior to and following a change of control and to align executive and stockholder interests by enabling executives to consider corporate transactions that are in the best interests of the stockholders and other constituents of the company without undue concern over whether the transactions may jeopardize the executives' own employment. Each agreement has an initial term of three years and will renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless either party to the agreement provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the date of automatic renewal.  For each of our NEOs, if we terminate such executive's employment without "Cause" or such executive terminates his employment for "Good Reason", and in each case, such termination occurs during a period beginning three months before a change of control and ending 12 months (or 24 months in the case of Mr. Seraphin) following a change of control, then subject to the executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims and the executive's continued compliance with the terms of the At Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement entered into between the executive and the Company, the executive will receive: (i) a lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% (or 200% in the case of Mr. Seraphin) of the executive's annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the executive's termination date or, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change of control; (ii) a lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% (or 200% in the case of Mr. Seraphin) of the executive's full bonus and commission for the year of termination at target level as in effect immediately prior to the executive's termination date, or, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change of control; (iii) 100% of the executive's then-outstanding and unvested equity awards will become vested in full (and if the amount of the award to vest is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria, then the equity awards will vest based on achievement at target levels for the relevant performance period(s)); and (iv) if the executive elects continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA for executive and his or her eligible dependents, the Company will reimburse the executive for the COBRA premiums for a maximum period of 12 months (or 18 months in the case of Mr. Seraphin). 
Change of Control Payments 
In addition to the above, outstanding equity awards for our current NEOs may vest upon termination in a "double-trigger" change of control event pursuant to change of control severance agreements. 
These agreements are designed to promote stability and retention of senior management prior to and following a change of control and to align executive and stockholder interests by enabling executives to consider corporate transactions that are in the best interests of the stockholders and other constituents of the Company without undue concern over whether the transactions may jeopardize the executives' own employment. See also "Executive Compensation Tables — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" below for a discussion of potential payments to our current NEOs, including our CEO. 
Tax Considerations 
Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers will not be deductible to the extent it exceeds $1 million. In 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the potential future effects of Section 162(m) when determining NEO compensation, and is expected to consider the potential future effects of Section 162(m) when determining future NEO compensation. 
Compensation Program Risk Evaluation 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the elements of NEO compensation to determine whether any portion of the overall program encourages excessive risk taking. The Compensation Committee's current assessment is that although the majority of compensation provided to our NEOs is performance-based, our compensation programs do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. The Compensation Committee believes that the design of these compensation programs encourages our NEOs to remain focused on both short- term and long-term strategic goals.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this report.

(1)  Amounts shown are estimated payouts for fiscal year 2018 to NEOs based on the 2018 bonus targets under the plan discussed under  "Compensation Discussion & Analysis — Components of NEO Compensation." Actual bonuses received by these named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 are reported in the Summary Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table under  the column entitled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" and described under "Compensation Discussion & Analysis — Executive Compensation Components."   
(2)  The stock options, restricted stock units and performance units granted on February 1, 2018 were granted as part of the Company's  regular performance review process. The stock options and restricted stock units will vest based on the executive's continued service to the Company through the applicable vesting dates. The performance unit grants will vest based upon the  achievement of Customer Licensing Income ("CLI") compound annual growth over the performance period. The initial payout will then be modified +/-25%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The value of a stock option, restricted stock unit or performance unit grant is based on the fair market value as of the grant date of such  award determined pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 718. The exercise price for all options granted to the named executive officer is 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the grant date. The restricted stock unit and performance unit grants are  full value awards and do not have an exercise price.  
(4)  Mr. Seraphin was promoted to Interim CEO effective as of June 28, 2018 and to CEO effective as of October 25, 2018. Upon his  promotion to Interim CEO, Mr. Seraphin's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum; and upon his promotion to CEO, his salary was increased to $550,000 per annum. In each such case, Mr. Seraphin's target incentive was increased  to 100% of base salary. Upon his promotion to interim CEO he was granted 29,782 RSUs and upon promotion to CEO he was granted 36,150 RSUs.  
(5)  Neither Mr. Black, nor Ms. Stark received a CIP payment for fiscal 2018, as they were not employed by the Company on the dates of  payment and therefore were not eligible. Equity grants to Mr. Black and Ms. Stark expired upon their termination from the Company, except that vested options expire one year after termination.

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Luc Seraphin, our CEO, who served as CEO on the date the median employee was identified: 
For fiscal year 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO), was $122,132; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented elsewhere in this proxy statement, was $2,426,279.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for fiscal year 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Seraphin, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of employees was approximately 20 to 1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected December 31, 2018, which is the last day of our fiscal year, as the date upon which we would identify the median employee.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During fiscal 2018, our employee population had consisted of approximately 836 individuals, including employees in the United States, Australia,  Canada, China, Finland, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Of these employees, 322 were located in the United States and 514 were located outside of the United States.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When determining our median employee, we excluded all employees from Australia (3), China (4), Taiwan (1), France (2), Singapore (2) and Japan  (3).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the "median employee" from our employee population we used payroll and equity plan records for January 1, 2018 through  December 31, 2018 (the "compensation measure").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation measure included the following: base salary, employer cost of benefits, employer retirement plan contributions, including 401(k)  matching, bonus payments, grant date fair value of stock options and restricted stock units, employee stock purchase plan discounts and sales commissions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For countries other than the United States and Canada, the employer cost of benefits was calculated based on the average employer cost per country.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For countries in the European Union, the employer cost of benefits includes the cost of holidays.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We annualized the base salary and employer cost of benefits of all permanent employees who were hired in fiscal year 2018 but did not work for us or  our subsidiaries for the entire fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amounts paid in foreign currency were converted into United States dollars using exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's  compensation for fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $122,132.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the annual total compensation for the CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation  Table for Mr. Seraphin, who served as the CEO as of December 31, 2018 (the date the median employee was identified). Because Mr. Seraphin was employed by us for all of 2018, we did not annualize any portion of his compensation.   
[END TABLE]
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
Equity Acceleration 
In the event of a "change in control" or "merger" of the Company, as defined in the plans, each outstanding option or equity award will be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor company. In the event that the successor company refuses to assume or substitute for the option or equity award, the participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her options or stock appreciation rights, including shares as to which such awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock will lapse, and, with respect to restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an option or stock appreciation right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a change of control, the administrator of the plan will notify the participant that the option or stock appreciation right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator, and the option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period. 
The form of option agreement for the 2015 Plan and the 2006 Plan, provide that if a successor company assumes outstanding options or awards or substitutes for options or awards with an equivalent award, then if following such assumption or substitution the participant's status as an employee or employee of the successor company, as applicable, is terminated by the successor company as a result of an "Involuntary Termination" other than for "Cause" within 12 months following the change in control, the option or award will immediately vest and become exercisable as to 100% of the shares subject to the option or award.  Change of Control Severance Agreements 
We have entered into change of control severance agreements with our executive officers, including our CEO, that governs certain applicable change of control severance obligations. These agreements are designed to promote stability and retention of senior management prior to and following a change of control and to align executive and stockholder interests by enabling executives to consider corporate transactions that are in the best interests of the stockholders and other constituents of the company without undue concern over whether the transactions may jeopardize the executives' own employment. Each agreement has an initial term of three years and will renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless either party to the agreement provides the other with written notice of non-renewal at least 90 days prior to the date of automatic renewal. 
For each of our NEOs other than our CEO, if we terminate such executive's employment without "Cause" or such executive terminates his employment for "Good Reason", and in each case, such termination occurs during a period beginning three months before a change of control and ending 12 months following a change of control, then subject to the executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims and the executive's continued compliance with the terms of the At Will Employment, Confidential Information, Invention Assignment, and Arbitration Agreement entered into between the executive and the Company, the executive will receive: (i) a lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% of the executive's annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the executive's termination date or, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change of control; (ii) a lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% of the executive's full bonus and commission for the year of termination at target level as in effect immediately prior to the executive's termination date, or, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change of control; (iii) 100% of the executive's then-outstanding and unvested equity awards will become vested in full (and if the amount of the award to vest is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria, then the equity awards will vest based on achievement at target levels for the relevant performance period(s)); and (iv) if the executive elects continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA for executive and his or her eligible dependents, the Company will reimburse the executive for the COBRA premiums for a maximum period of 12 months. 
CEO Employment Agreement 
Mr. Seraphin's employment agreement with the Company provides that in the event the Company terminates his employment with the Company without "Cause" and such termination does not occur within the three months prior to or 24 months following a change of control of the Company, Mr. Seraphin will receive: (i) a lump sum payment of 100% of his base salary and target bonus, (ii) Company payment of his COBRA premiums (in lieu of continued employee benefits) for a period of 12 months, and (iii) 12 months additional vesting of all equity awards with a service based component (excluding awards with a performance-based component if the performance metric has not been achieved by the termination date). In the event the Company terminates Mr. Seraphin's employment with the Company without "Cause" or Mr. Seraphin voluntarily terminates his employment for "Good Reason", and in either event, such termination occurs within three months prior to or 24 months following a change of control of the Company, Mr. Seraphin will receive: (i) a lump sum payment of 200% of his base salary and target bonus, (ii) Company payment of his COBRA premiums (in lieu of continued employee benefits) for a period of 18 months, and (iii) 100% vesting of all equity awards with a service based component (excluding awards with a performance-based component if the performance metric has not been achieved by the termination date). 
The severance payments and other benefits will be subject to Mr. Seraphin entering into (and not revoking) a release of claims agreement against the Company and Mr. Seraphin's continued compliance with certain non-compete, non-solicit, and non-disparagement provisions contained in the Agreements. In the event that the severance payments and other benefits payable to Mr. Seraphin constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the U.S. tax code and would be subject to the applicable excise tax, then Mr. Seraphin's severance and other benefits will be either: (i) delivered in full, or (ii) delivered to such lesser extent which   would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by Mr. Seraphin on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits.

Summary of Director Compensation Plan 
Annual Retainer. Each independent director receives an annual retainer of $40,000 in cash. The Chairpersons of the Board and Audit Committee each receive an additional annual retainer of $25,000. The Chairperson of the Compensation Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $20,000. The Chairperson of the Corporate Development Committee, which oversees the Company's acquisition and divestiture activity, receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000. The Chairperson of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $10,000. Each annual retainer is paid in quarterly installments. The annual retainers were not increased for 2018. 
Annual Equity Grant. Each independent director receives an annual equity grant of such number of RSUs with an approximate fair market value equal to $160,000 at the time of grant. The RSU grants vest in full at the end of a one-year period, subject to the independent director continuing to serve through each applicable vesting date. If the director discontinues service prior to the vesting of any RSU grant, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, permit such grant to vest pro rata for the portion of the year during which such director served. 
Initial Equity Grant. Any newly elected independent director joining our Board of Directors will receive an initial option to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock when he or she is first elected as a member of the Board. The term of such options will not exceed ten years. The option grants vest over a four-year period, with one-eighth of shares subject to the option vesting six months after the date of grant and the remaining shares vesting ratably each month thereafter, subject to the independent director continuing to serve through each applicable vesting date. 
Each of the options granted to our independent directors was issued under the 2006 Plan or the 2015 Plan, which are plans that are available to all of our employees. As described under "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," the 2006 Plan and the 2015 Plan provide for certain acceleration upon a "change in control" of the Company, as defined under such plans. In addition, with respect to options and any other equity awards granted to non-employee directors that are assumed or substituted for upon a change of control under the 2006 Plan or the 2015 Plan, if the non-employee director is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation, the options and other equity awards granted to such non-employee director will fully vest and be exercisable with respect to 100% of the shares subject to such options and other equity awards. 
Pursuant to the Board's stock ownership guidelines, each independent director is expected to accumulate and hold an equivalent value of our common stock of three times their annual total cash compensation and to achieve this by five years from the date that the director joined the Board. Directors are expected to maintain this minimum amount of stock ownership throughout their tenure on the Board. As of December 31, 2018, all of our directors met their ownership requirements.

 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND REPUTATION 
Rambus recognizes that environmental, social and governance issues are of increasing importance to many investors. At Rambus, we are dedicated to strengthening and improving the quality of life in our communities through partnerships, engagement and employee giving and we believe that working together with our communities creates better outcomes on issues that matter to us all. Corporate responsibility is an enterprise-wide commitment and our Board of Directors monitors and supports our corporate responsibility efforts. 
People and Communities. We believe in making a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. From organizations dedicated to health, housing and development, animal welfare and children and families in need — we strive to empower the local community through philanthropic efforts. We also encourage our employees to donate to charitable organizations of their choice and the Company matches gifts to charities up to $1,000 per year per employee. Further, we encourage our employees to volunteer at least eight hours of their time per year to charitable causes. During fiscal 2018, we donated approximately $200,000 to charitable organizations in the U.S. and around the world. 
Education. We seek to broaden the educational opportunities of students in our communities who demonstrate a passion for science and technology that extends beyond the classroom. Through science fairs, STEM education, and our "Innovator of the Future" scholarship, we are working to empower the next generation of inventors and are active in our communities when it comes to educational engagement. 
Sustainability. We are committed to integrating sustainability into our day-to-day operations to conserve, protect and improve the environment we live in. This is why we chose to work in a LEED, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, platinum certified building for our headquarters location. While using less water and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we also improve energy performance. We consider our efforts here a win, win. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We invest in the long-term development and engagement of our employees by aspiring to have an increasingly diverse workforce and inclusive environment, training and development programs and a culture where our people can thrive. We are committed to providing and supporting a work environment that promotes equality of opportunity among our employees. We strive for our workforce to be truly representative of all sections of society and for each employee to feel respected and able to perform at his or her best. In the U.S. 55% of our employee population is considered diverse and 17% is female.  OTHER MATTERS
