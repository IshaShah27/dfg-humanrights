 Dear MusclePharm Stockholders:
 I am pleased to report that the efforts and strong contributions from my team have aided MusclePharm in making significant progress toward sustainable and profitable growth.
 With the previously disclosed restructuring behind us, 2017 ended with the first sequential quarterly top-line revenue growth since early 2016. Our newly crafted strategy focused the Company in four key areas:
  Diversify our customer base.
  Build out a world-class consumer-based marketing capability.
  Invest in new product development.
  Manage our costs to ensure profitable revenue growth.
 In 2017, we leaned heavily into our expectation that our customers want to be able to easily find and purchase our products online. As such, we partnered with Amazon to optimize the MusclePharm experience on that platform, resulting in a 247% year-over-year increase in associated revenue growth. We made a strategic decision to focus on the Food, Drug, Mass ("FDM") segment and fill our retail sales leadership role. Under this FDM leadership, we have gained a deep understanding of the FDM landscape, which yielded a redesigned FDM product portfolio that is being met with strong customer feedback. Finally, we increased our international efforts and were able to shift our international portfolio from 35%in 2016 up to 40% in 2017.
 We believe that it is our responsibility to be deeplyin-tune with the needs of our customer base. We believe that listening to our customers is the best strategy to succeed. As part of our focus on our customers, in the fall of 2017, we relocated our corporate headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Burbank, California in order to be in closer proximity to our core consumer base and key industry influencers. We believe being in such close proximity is an advantage in our highly competitive industry.
 Investment in product development is the next pillar that we believe will be essential to MusclePharm's future success. We take pride in developing delicious, effective, and exciting supplement products, and we have renewed our efforts to do so. In the second quarter of 2017, we reintroduced our MP Natural product line. This line meets a growing trend of non-GMO performance supplements and opens a new distribution opportunity with natural retailers, as well as an opportunity to further penetrate FDM retailers. Inthe third quarter of 2017, we captured an additional portion of the growing pre-workout market with Wreckage Pre-Workout, which includes 300 milligrams of caffeine and new-to-the-market ingredient, Vaso6.We transitioned Combat Crunch, the Bodybuilding.com three-time Protein Bar of the Year award winner, back to its original recipe late in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 The MusclePharm team spent considerable time in 2017 evaluating and diversifying our portfolio of products with a goal that our go-forward product line contributes to both top-line and bottom-line growth. At the same time, we have partnered with our supply chain vendors to realize cost savings and negotiate terms that are mutually beneficial.
 We continue to execute our growth strategy and focus on our core operations. We expect revenue to grow as we heighten the focus on our core MusclePharm products and develop new excitingproducts. We have a thoughtful marketing strategy rooted in consumer insights and we are working to bring additional product innovation to the market. We have improved manufacturing and distribution infrastructure in a way that we believe supports expense management.

      Sincerely  yours,

[END TABLE]
 We made this proxy statement and accompanying form of proxy available to stockholders beginning on October 26,2018.
 Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting to be Held on December 7, 2018:
 This proxy statement, form of proxy and the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available electronically at our website at www.musclepharmcorp.com.
 Solicitation
 This solicitation is made on behalf of our Board of Directors. The Company will bear the costs of preparing, mailing, and other costs of the proxy solicitation made by our Board of Directors. Certain of our officers and employees may solicit the submission of proxies authorizing the voting of shares in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations. Such solicitations may be made by telephone, facsimile transmission or personal solicitation. No additional compensation will be paid to such officers, directors or regular employees for such services. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in sending proxy material to stockholders.
 Voting Rights and Outstanding Shares
 Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. The outstanding common stock constitutes the only class of our securities entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, and each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on October 22, 2018, there were 15,314,667shares of common stock issued and outstanding, which were held by approximately 309 holders of record.  A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy with authority to vote on at least one matter to be presented at the meeting, which includes brokers who are able to vote on any of the routine matters presented at the Annual Meeting, will constitute a quorum. We will appoint an election inspector for the meeting to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting.
 All of our proposals require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of outstanding shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions have the same effect as negative votes on such proposals. Broker non-votes are not counted for any purpose in determining whether proposals have been approved.
 Voting by Proxy by Mail
 Stockholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote by proxy by mail. Instructions for voting by proxy by mail are set forth on the Notice of Proxy Materials mailed to you, or on the proxy card mailed to you if you chose to receive materials by mail.
 If you sign and return a proxy card by mail but do not give voting instructions, your shares will be voted (1) FOR ALL of the four (4) nominees named in Proposal No. 1 in this proxy statement; (2) FOR the ratification of the appointment of Plante & Moran, PLLC as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2018; (3) FOR the approval of compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in this proxy statement; and (4) as the proxy holders deem advisable, in their discretion, on other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
 If your shares are held in street name, the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. A number of banks and brokerage firms participate in a program that permits stockholders whose shares are held in street name to direct their vote over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany this proxy statement will tell you how to use the Internet or telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account. If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail, but may incur costs, such as usage charges, from telephone companies or Internet service providers.
 Voting in Person at the Annual Meeting
 If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in "street name," which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the Annual Meeting, you must bring to the Annual Meeting a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee who is the record holder of the shares, authorizing you to vote at the Annual Meeting.
 Revocability of Proxies
 Any proxy may be revoked at any time before it is exercised by filing with the Company's Corporate Secretary an instrument revoking it or by submitting prior to the time of the Annual Meeting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Stockholders who have executed and returned a proxy and who then attend the Annual Meeting and desire to vote in person are requested to so notify the Corporate Secretary in writing prior to the time of the Annual Meeting. We request that all such written notices of revocation to the Company be addressed to Corporate Secretary, MusclePharm Corporation, at the address of our principal executive offices at 4400 Vanowen St., Burbank, CA 91505. Our telephone number is (800) 292-3909.
 Stockholder Proposals to be Presented at the Next Annual Meeting
 Any stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), may submit to the Board of Directors proposals to be presented at the 2018 annual meeting. Such proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. To be timely, a stockholder's notice of a proposal must be submitted in writing by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above no earlier than July 16, 2018 and no later than August 15, 2018.

 Board of Directors
 Our Board of Directors may establish the authorized number of directors from time to time by resolution. Our bylaws authorize a Board of Directors to consist of between one and nine members. The number of directors currently authorized by resolution of the Board of Directors is four. Four directors are nominated to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Our nominated directors, if elected, will continue to serve as directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal.
 Our Board of Directors held seven meetings during 2017. The Board of Directors also acted four times by unanimous written consent. No member of our Board of Directors attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors (held during the period for which he was a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which such director served (held during the period that such director served). Members of our Board of Directors are invited and encouraged to attend each annual meeting of stockholders.
 Board Leadership Structure
 Ryan Drexler, our Chief Executive Officer and President, serves as Chairman of our Board of Directors and presides over meetings of the Board of Directors, and holds such other powers and carries out such other duties as are customarily carried out by the Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Drexler brings valuable insight to our Board of Directors due to the perspective and experience that he brings as our Chief Executive Officer and President.
 Director Independence
 We are an over-the-counter listed company we have nevertheless opted under our Corporate Governance Guidelines to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance rules requiring director independence. The Board of Directors has determined that our non-employee directors, Mr.Desmond and Mr. Bush, are each "independent directors" as such term is defined in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and, therefore, the Compensation Committee, Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, and Audit Committee are each comprised solely of independent directors.
 Audit Committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the Board of Directors, or any other board committee: accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.  Our Board of Directors has determined that none of our non-employee directors has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the rules of Nasdaq. Our Board of Directors has also determined that past and present Directors, who comprise our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and our Strategic Initiatives Committee, satisfied and satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable SEC rules,Nasdaq rules and applicable rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

 The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of assembling a Board that can best perpetuate the success of the Company and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience.
 Prior to each annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, and whenever there is otherwise a vacancy on the Board of Directors, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider incumbent Board members and other well-qualified individuals as potential director nominees. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will determine whether to retain an executive search firm to identify Board candidates, and if so, will identify the search firm and approve the search firm's fees and other retention terms and will specify for the search firm the criteria to use in identifying potential candidates, consistent with the director qualification criteria described above. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will review each potential candidate. Management may assist the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee in the review process at the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee's direction. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will select the candidate or candidates it believes are the most qualified to recommend to the Board for selection as a director nominee. Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates recommended by our stockholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Charterand our bylaws.

 In July 2017, the Board approved a new compensation program for our non-employee directors. Under this policy, as of July 1, 2017, Mr. Bush and Mr. Desmond will earnannual cash retainer fees of $140,000 and $100,000, respectively, and be granted, on an annual basis, restricted shares having a grant date fair value of $100,000 and $150,000, respectively. Additionally, in conjunction with our refinancing, each member of our refinancing committee, were granted a onetime fee of $40,000. Our non-employee directors will also receive an additional cash payment to compensate them for taxes payable in respect of their restricted share grants, described below.
 All cash retainers are prorated for partial years of service. We pay annual cash retainer fees to our non-employee directors quarterly. We also reimburse our non-employee directors for their travel and out of pocket expenses. Members of the Board of Directors who also are our employees do not receive any compensation for their service as directors. Our directors do not receive Board meeting fees. For 2017, each of our non-employee directors received awards of restricted common stock having a grant date value as described above, which were granted in quarterly installments. The number of shares for each quarterly awardwas determined by dividing[one-fourth of] the dollar value above by the average closing price of MusclePharm's common stock for the first fifteen business days of the first month ofsuch quarter. For 2017, our non-employee directors also received additional cash payments to compensate them for taxes payable in respect of their restricted share awards.
 2017 Director Compensation. The table below sets forth the compensation paid to each non-employee member of the Board of Directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Messrs.

 Code of Conduct
 Our Board of Directors established a Code of Conduct applicable to our officers and employees. The Code of Conduct is accessible on our website at www.musclepharmcorp.com. If we make any substantive amendments to the Code of Conduct or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of the Code of Conduct to our officers, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K.
 Corporate Governance Overview
 Our business, assets and operations are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. Members of our Board of Directors are kept informed of our business through discussions with our Chief Executive Officer, our external counsel, members of management and other Company employees as well as our independent auditors, and by reviewing materials provided to them and participating in meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees.
 In addition to its management oversight function, our Board of Directors remains committed to strong and effective corporate governance, and, as a result, it regularly monitors our corporate governance policies and practices to ensure we meet or exceed the requirements of applicable laws, regulations and rules, the Nasdaq listing standards (even though we are not subject to them), as well as the best practices of other public companies.
 Our corporate governance program features the following:
 a Board of Directors that is nominated for election annually;
 we have no stockholder rights plan in place;
 periodically updated charters for each of the Board's committees, which clearly establish the roles and responsibilities of each such committee;
 regular executive sessions among our non-employee and independent directors;  a Board of Directors that enjoys unrestricted access to our management, employees and professional advisers;
 a clear Code of Conduct that is reviewed regularly for best practices;
 a clear Insider Trading Policy that is reviewed regularly;
 a Corporate Communications Policy that is reviewed with employees and the Board periodically;
 a clear set of Corporate Governance Guidelines that is reviewed regularly for best practices;
 no board member is serving on an excessive number of public company boards; and
 Board of Directors Role in Risk Management
 The Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. Risk management includes not only understanding company specific risks and the steps management implements to manage those risks, but also the level of risk acceptable and appropriate for us. Management is responsible for establishing our business strategy, identifying and assessing the related risks and implementing appropriate risk management practices. Our Board of Directors reviews our business strategy and management's assessment of the related risk, and discusses with management the appropriate level of risk for us. For example, the Board of Directors meets with management at least quarterly to review, advise and direct management with respect to strategic business risks, risks related to our new product development, financial risks, among others. The Board of Directors also delegates oversight to Board committees to oversee selected elements of risk.
 The Audit Committee oversees financial risk exposures, including monitoring the integrity of our financial statements, internal controls over financial reporting, and the independence of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee reviews periodic internal controls and related assessments from our finance department. The Audit Committee also assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to compliance matters and meets at least quarterly with our finance department, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and internal or external legal counsel to discuss risks related to our financial reporting function. In addition, the Audit Committee ensures that our business is conducted with the highest standards of ethical conduct in compliance with applicable laws and regulations by monitoring our Code of Business Conduct and our Corporate Compliance Hotline, and the Audit Committee discusses other risk assessment and our risk management policies periodically with management.
 The Compensation Committee participates in the design of the compensation program and helps create incentives that do not encourage a level of risk-taking behavior that is inconsistent with our business strategy.
 The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee oversees governance-related risks by working with management to establish corporate governance guidelines applicable to us, and making recommendations regarding director nominees, the determination of director independence, Board of Directors leadership structure and membership on Board committees.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 Overview
 We are eligible to take advantage of the rules applicable to a "smaller reporting company," as defined in the Exchange Act, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As a "smaller reporting company" we are permitted, and have opted, to comply with the scaled back executive compensation disclosure rules applicable to a "smaller reporting company" under the Exchange Act. Only two individuals served as executive officers, as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and only one additional individual served as an executive officer at any time during such fiscal year. The following discussion relates to the compensation of those executive officers, who we refer to as our "named executive officers" or "NEOs" in this proxy statement. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our NEOs were:
 Ryan Drexler—Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors;
 Brian Casutto – Executive Vice President of Sales and Operations; and
 Brent Baker – Former Executive Vice President of International Business*
 *Mr. Baker's employment with the Company terminated on March 23, 2017.
 Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain talented executives that will drive Company growth and create long-term shareholder value. The Compensation Committee oversees and administers our executive compensation program, with input and recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer.
 Elements of Executive Compensation
 Our executive compensation program has three main components: base salary, cash bonuses and incentive equity awards. Our named executive officers also receive employee benefits that are made available to our salaried employees generally, are eligible to receive certain compensation and benefits in connection with a change in control or termination of employment, and receive certain perquisites, in each case, as described below.
 Base Salary
 The Compensation Committee determined the initial base salary for each of our named executive officers and each year determines whether to approve any base salary adjustments based upon the Company's performance, the named executive officer's individual performance, changes in duties and responsibilities of the named executive officer and the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to his own base salary). For 2017, Messrs. Drexler's and Casutto's base salaries were not increased from 2016 levels and Mr. Baker's annual base salary was increased by $50,000. For 2017, our named executive officers' base salaries were as follows:

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Ryan  Drexler    $550,000   
 Brian  Casutto    $400,000   
 Brent  Baker    $350,000   
[END TABLE]
 Cash Bonuses
 Pursuant to their employment agreements, each of our named executive officers is eligible to earn a cash bonus, with a target amount established by the Compensation Committee, based on the achievement of specified performance goals. For 2017, the target bonus amount was $300,000 for Mr. Casutto and $400,000 for Mr. Baker. Mr. Drexler was eligible to receive cash bonuses of up to $350,000 based on the achievement of specified performance goals. For 2017, Messrs. Drexler and Casutto earned cash bonuses in the amounts set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. In connection with his termination of employment in March 2017, Mr. Baker received a bonus of $80,311 for the first quarter of 2018.  Incentive Equity Awards
 Incentive equity awards granted by the Company have historically been in the form of restricted stock awards. The Company also grants stock options from time to time. The Compensation Committee believes that equity-based awards are an effective retention tool that also align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders. In 2017, we granted Mr. Drexler 350,000 shares of restricted stock, which vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Mr. Drexler's equity awards also vest in full upon a termination of his employment or upon change in control. None of our other named executive officers were granted equity-based awards in 2017. In connection with his termination of employment in March 2017, 10,000 shares of restricted stock held by Mr. Baker that were granted in 2016 vested in full in accordance with the original terms of the grant.
 Employment Agreements
 We have entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Drexler and Mr. Casutto that include certain severance and change in control payments. These agreements are described in detail under "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table" below.
  Employee Benefit Plans and Perquisites
 We maintain a Section 401(k) Savings/Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan) for eligible employees of the Company and certain affiliates, including our named executive officers. The 401(k) Plan permits eligible employees to defer up to the maximum dollar amount allowed by law. The employee's elective deferrals are immediately vested upon contribution to the 401(k) Plan. We currently make discretionary matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to 100% of each eligible employee's deferrals up to 4% of his or her qualifying compensation, subject to a total employer contribution maximum of $10,600 and limits imposed by applicable law.
 We do not maintain any other defined benefit, defined contribution or deferred compensation plans for our employees.
 Our current named executive officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, vision, group life and disability insurance, in each case on the same basis as our other employees, subject to applicable law. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all employees, including our current named executive officers. In addition, we provide certain highly-compensated employees, including our current named executive officers, with life insurance and supplemental long-term disability coverage. We also provide certain perquisites, as described and quantified in the Summary Compensation Table below under "All Other Compensation."  Summary Compensation Table

 Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table
 We have entered into employment agreements with each of Mr. Drexler and Mr. Casutto that include certain severance and change in control payments and entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Baker that provides for severance benefits, in each case, as described below. As used below, the terms "without cause," "good reason," "qualifying sale," "aggregate purchase price," "performance bonus," "cash-based incentives," and "change in control" are defined in the applicable agreements.
 Mr. Drexler. Mr. Drexler is party to an employment agreement with the Company, which was entered into as of February 11, 2016 and has subsequently been amended and restated, most recently effective as of February 1, 2018. Subject to earlier termination as provided therein, the term of his agreement runs through February 1, 2021 and automatically renews for successive one-year terms thereafter, unless either party provides at least three months' written notice of its or his intention not to review. Under his employment agreement, Mr. Drexler was entitled to a base salary of $550,00 per year for 2017 and is entitled to a base salary of $700,000 per year for 2018, which will be increased to $750,000 per year effective January 1, 2020, in each case, subject to increase by the board. For 2017, Mr. Drexler was eligible to receive cash-based incentives of up to $350,000 based on the achievement of specified performance goals and, under his amended and restated agreement, is eligible to receive a 2018 performance bonus equal to 75% of his annual base salary, subject to the Company's achievement of specified performance conditions unless otherwise determined by the Board. Under his amended and restated employment agreement, Mr. Drexler is also eligible to receive additional cash-based incentives of up to $350,000 based on the achievement of specified performance goals.  Concurrently with entering into the amended and restated employment agreement in February 2018, Mr. Drexler and the Company entered into a transaction bonus agreement, which provides that, upon the occurrence of a qualifying sale, and provided that at the time of the qualifying sale Mr. Drexler is an owner of at least 20% of the shares of the Company, Mr. Drexler will be entitled to a transaction bonus equal to 10% of the aggregate purchase price, if such price is in excess of $50 million. Mr. Drexler is entitled to this transaction bonus regardless of whether the qualifying transaction occurs during his employment or at any time thereafter.
 If Mr. Drexler's employment is terminated for any reason, each equity award granted to him will fully vest and he will be entitled to any unpaid performance bonus or cash-based incentives (as described above), to the extent earned as of the date of such termination, in addition to any amounts required by law or Company policy.

 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 Related-Party Notes Payable
On November 3, 2017, we entered into a refinancing transaction (the "Refinancing") with Mr. Ryan Drexler, the Company's Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President. The refinancing was overseen and approved by a Special Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised of John J. Desmond and William Bush, each of whom is an independent member of our Board of Directors. As part of the Refinancing, we issued to Mr. Drexler an amended and restated convertible secured promissory note (the "Refinanced Convertible Note") in the original principal amount of $18,000,000, which amends and restates (i) a convertible secured promissory note dated as of December 7, 2015, and amended as of January 14, 2017, in the original principal amount of $6,000,000 with an interest rate of 8% prior to the amendment and 10% following the amendment (the "2015 Convertible Note"), (ii) a convertible secured promissory note dated as of November 8, 2016, in the original principal amount of $11,000,000 with an interest rate of 10% (the "2016 Convertible Note") , and (iii) a secured demand promissory note dated as of July 27, 2017, in the original principal amount of $1,000,000 with an interest rate of 15% (the "2017 Note", and together with the 2015 Convertible Note and the 2016 Convertible Note, collectively, the "Prior Notes"). The due date of the 2015 Convertible Note and the 2016 Convertible Note was November 8, 2017. The 2017 Note was due on demand.
 2017 Refinanced Convertible Note
The $18 million Refinanced Convertible Note bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum. Interest payments are due on the last day of each quarter. At our option (as determined by its independent directors), we may repay up to one sixth of any interest payment by either adding such amount to the principal amount of the note or by converting such interest amount into an equivalent amount our common stock. Any interest not paid when due shall be capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Refinanced Convertible Note and bear interest on the applicable interest payment date along with all other unpaid principal, capitalized interest, and other capitalized obligations.
Both the principal and the interest under the Refinanced Convertible Note are due on December 31, 2019, unless converted earlier. Mr. Drexler may convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $1.11 per share at any time. We may prepay the Refinanced Convertible Note by giving Mr. Drexler between 15 and 60 days' notice depending upon the specific circumstances, subject to Mr. Drexler's conversion right.
The Refinanced Convertible Note contains customary events of default, including, among others, the failure by us to make a payment of principal or interest when due. Following an event of default, interest will accrue at the rate of 14% per annum. In addition, following an event of default, any conversion, redemption, payment or prepayment of the Refinanced Convertible Note will be at a premium of 105%. The Refinanced Convertible Note also contains customary restrictions on the ability of us to, among other things, grant liens or incur indebtedness other than certain obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business. The restrictions are also subject to certain additional qualifications and carveouts, as set forth in the Refinanced Convertible Note. The Refinanced Convertible Note is subordinated to certain other indebtedness of us, as described below.
As part of the Refinancing, we and Mr. Drexler entered into a restructuring agreement (the "Restructuring Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to enter into the Refinanced Convertible Note and to amend and restate the security agreement pursuant to which the Prior Notes were secured by all of the assets and properties of us and our subsidiaries whether tangible or intangible, by entering into the Third Amended and Restated Security Agreement (the "Amended Security Agreement"). Pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, we agreed to pay, on the effective date of the Refinancing, all outstanding interest on the Prior Notes through November 8, 2017 and certain fees and expenses incurred by Mr. Drexler in connection with the Restructuring.
In connection with the refinancing, the Company recorded a debt discount of $1.2 million. The debt discount is equal to the change in the fair value of the conversion option between the Refinanced Convertible Note and the Prior Notes. The fair value of the conversion option was determined a Monte Carlo simulation and the model of stock price behavior known as GBM which simulates a future period as a random step from a previous period. The Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to perform this complex valuation.
In addition, the Refinanced Convertible Note contains two embedded derivatives for default interest and an event of default put. Due to the unlikely event of default, the embedded derivatives have a de minimis value as of December 31, 2017.
 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest expense related to the related party notes was $2.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in interest was paid to Mr. Drexler. For the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with issuing the Prior Notes, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature of $601,000 as a debt discount which was amortized over the original term of the debt using the effective interest method.
  Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Parties
We adopted a written related person transactions policy that our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as a director, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, and any members of the immediate family of and any entity affiliated with any of the foregoing persons, are not permitted to enter into a material related person transaction with us without the review and approval of our Audit Committee, or a committee composed solely of independent directors in the event it is inappropriate for our Audit Committee to review such transaction due to a conflict of interest. The policy provides that any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, nominee for election as a director, beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock or with any of their immediate family members or affiliates, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 will be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, we expect that our Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to the Audit Committee, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related persons interest in the transaction. Although we have not always had a written policy for the review and approval of transactions with related persons, our Board of Directors has historically reviewed and approved any transaction where a director or officer had a financial interest, including all of the transactions described above. Prior to approving such a transaction, the material facts as to a director's or officer's relationship or interest as to the agreement or transaction were disclosed to our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors would take this information into account when evaluating the transaction and in determining whether such transaction was fair to us and in the best interest of all of our stockholders.
 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
 Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our directors and named executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and our other equity securities with the SEC. As a practical matter, we assist our directors and officers by monitoring transactions and completing and filing Section 16 reports on their behalf. During 2017, our named executive officers and directors filed the required reports under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as follows:

 Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies
 Before an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is engaged by us or our subsidiaries to render audit or non-audit services, the Audit Committee shall pre-approve the engagement. Audit Committee pre-approval of audit and non-audit services will not be required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee regarding our engagement of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the Audit Committee is informed of each service provided and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee's responsibilities under the Exchange Act to our management. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the Audit Committee the authority to grant pre-approvals, provided such approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at a subsequent meeting. If the Audit Committee elects to establish pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the Audit Committee must be informed of each non-audit service provided by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Audit Committee pre-approval of non-audit services (other than review and attest services) also will not be required if such services fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. All non-audit services provided by Plante & Moran, PLLC during years 2015 and 2016 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policy described above.
 Required Vote
 The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the appointment of Plante & Moran,PLLC.
 Recommendation of the Board of Directors
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF Plante & Moran, PLLC AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018.  PROPOSAL 3
 ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules.
 Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain talented and qualified senior executives to manage and lead our Company and to motivate them to pursue and meet our corporate objectives. Under this program, our named executive officers are rewarded for individual and collective contributions to our success consistent with our "pay for performance" orientation. Furthermore, the executive compensation program is aligned with the nature and dynamics of our business, which focuses management on achieving the Company's annual and long-term business strategies and objectives.
 Our Compensation Committee regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that it achieves the desired goals of emphasizing long-term value creation and aligning the interests of management and stockholders through the use of equity-based awards. We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."
 Required Vote
 The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to approve the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.
 The "say-on-pay" vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. Although the vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors value the opinions of the stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions.
 Recommendation of the Board of Directors
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC.
 HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
 We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC known as "householding." This procedure allows multiple stockholders residing at the same address the convenience of receiving a single copy of the Notice. This allows us to save money by reducing the number of documents we must print and mail, and helps protect the environment as well. Householding is available to both registered stockholders (i.e., those stockholders with certificates registered in their name) and streetname holders (i.e., those stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage). The Company will promptly deliver, upon oral or written request, a separate copy of the Notice to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for additional copies should be directed to Investor Relations.  Registered Stockholders
 If you are a registered stockholder that has requested to receive proxy materials by mail and you have consented to our mailing of proxy materials and other stockholder information only to one account in your household, as identified by you, we will deliver or mail a single copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy statement for all registered stockholders residing at the same address. Your consent will be perpetual unless you revoke it, which you may do at any time by contacting the Householding Department of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, or by calling 1-800-542-1061. If you revoke your consent, we will begin sending you individual copies of future mailings of these documents within 30 days after we receive your revocation notice. If you received a householded mailing this year, and you would like to receive additional copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy statement mailed to you, please send a e-mail request to Investor Relations at investors@musclepharm.com, or write to c/o Investor Relations, MusclePharm Corporation, 4400 Vanowen St., Burbank, CA 91505 and we will promptly deliver the requested copy.
 Registered stockholders that have requested to receive proxy materials by mail and have not consented to householding will continue to receive copies of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our proxy statements for each registered stockholder residing at the same address. As a registered stockholder, you may elect to participate in householding and receive only a single copy of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and proxy statements for all registered stockholders residing at the same address by contacting Broadridge as outlined above.
 Streetname Holders
 Stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage may elect to participate in householding or revoke their consent to participate in householding by contacting their respective brokers.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 This Proxy Statement, as well as other written reports and oral statements that we make from time to time, includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Act"). The words "ongoing," "believes," "expects," "may," "will" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees that the future results, plans, intentions or expectations expressed or implied will be achieved. Matters subject to forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, competitive and other factors, which may cause actual financial or operating results or the timing of events to be materially different than those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: inability to raise capital with agreeable terms or at all, resolve litigation, failure of our manufacturers to meet our production needs; failure to successfully invest in or launch new product introductions; general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including financial market conditions, and the other factors set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in other public filings with the SEC. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments.
 OTHER MATTERS
 We are not aware of any matters that may come before the meeting other than those referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If any other matter shall properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote all proxies in accordance with their best judgment. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC, are available free of charge on our website at www.musclepharmcorp.com or you can request a copy free of charge by e-mail request to Investor Relations to investors@musclepharm.com.
