January 29, 2019 
Dear Shareholder: 
You are cordially invited to attend a Special Meeting of Shareholders (the "Meeting") of the Gator Focus Fund (the "Fund"), the sole series of the Gator Series Trust (the "Trust"), to be held at 9:30 a.m., Eastern time, on February 11, 2019 at the offices of the Fund's investment adviser, Gator Capital Management, LLC, 100 South Ashley Drive, Suite 895, Tampa, Florida 33602.  Formal notice of the Meeting appears after this letter, followed by a Proxy Statement.
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to vote on a proposal to amend the Fund's fundamental investment restriction regarding concentration (the "Concentration Policy Amendment") and to transact any other business that may properly come before the Meeting.  We hope that you can attend the Meeting in person; however, we urge you in any event to vote your shares by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. 
The reason for the Meeting is that the Fund's management has proposed to change the Fund's investment strategy to focus on investments in issuers within the financial industry or group of industries and the real estate industry or group of industries.  In order to implement this change in investment strategy, the Fund's concentration policy needs to be amended because it currently prohibits the Fund from investing more than 25% of its assets in any particular industry.   After carefully considering the proposed investment strategy and the related Concentration Policy Amendment at a meeting on November 30, 2018, the Board determined that each would be in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders and, as a result, unanimously approved the Concentration Policy Amendment, pending shareholder approval.  Additional information about the Concentration Policy Amendment is described in the Proxy Statement. 
The Board is now requesting that shareholders approve the Concentration Policy Amendment.  
After careful consideration, the Board has unanimously approved the Concentration Policy Amendment and recommends that you vote "FOR"  approval of   the Concentration Policy Amendment.
Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares you own.  Please take a few minutes to read the Proxy Statement and cast your vote.  It is important that your vote be received no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on February 10, 2019. 
Please take a moment now to vote by completing and returning your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope.
Detailed information about each proposal is contained in the enclosed materials.  Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting in person, your vote is needed.  Once you have decided how you will vote, please promptly complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card.  You may  receive more than one set of proxy materials if you hold shares in more than one account.  Please be sure to vote each proxy card you receive. If you have any questions about the proposal or the voting instructions, please call us at 855-270-2678 or call your financial advisor.
We appreciate your participation and prompt response in this matter and thank you for your continued support.  
Sincerely,
Derek Pilecki

January 29, 2019 IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSALS
You should carefully read the entire text of the Proxy Statement.  We have provided you with the following questions and answers to give you a general overview of some of the important information in the Proxy Statement.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q.
What is happening? Why did I get this package of materials?
A.
You are receiving the enclosed Proxy Statement as a shareholder of the Gator Focus Fund (the "Fund"), the sole series of Gator Series Trust (the "Trust"), in connection with a special meeting of shareholders of the Fund (the "Meeting") scheduled to be held at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on February 11, 2019.  All holders of Fund shares as of the close of business on January 23, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on?
A:
You are being asked to approve the following proposals (the "Proposals" and each a "Proposal"): 
(i)
To approve a proposed amendment to the fundamental investment restriction regarding concentration for the Fund; and
(ii)
To transact any other business (none is currently contemplated) that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment thereof in the discretion of the proxies or their substitutes.
Q:
Why am I being asked to vote on an amendment to the Fund's fundamental investment restriction regarding concentration?
A:
The reason for the Meeting is that The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act") requires all mutual funds, including the Fund, to adopt "fundamental" investment restrictions with respect to several specific types of activities ("Fundamental Investment Limitations"), including a Fund's ability to concentrate its investments in any particular industry or group of industries. Fundamental Investment Limitations may be modified only with the approval of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of a Fund, as defined in the Investment Company Act. 
Since the Fund's outset, the Fund has had an investment strategy that focused broadly on investment in small cap equity securities and did not concentrate its investments in issuers of any particular industry or group of industries.  Accordingly, at inception, the Fund adopted a Fundamental Investment Limitation that prohibited the investment of 25% or more of the Fund's total assets in securities of issuers in any particular industry.
Recently, Fund management, after consultation with the Fund's investment adviser, Gator Capital Management, LLC (the "Adviser"), has proposed a shift in the Fund's investment strategy to focus on issuers within the financial and real estate sectors.  To facilitate this shift in the focus of the  Fund's strategy, the Fund's Fundamental Investment Limitation regarding concentration must be amended to permit concentration in the financial industry or group of industries and the real estate industry or group of industries.
Therefore, in this Proposal, you are being asked to approve the following change to the Fund's Fundamental Investment Limitation regarding concentration (the "Concentration Policy Amendment"):
[BEGIN TABLE]
Existing Concentration Policy  Proposed Concentration Policy Amendment  
As a matter of fundamental policy, the Fund may not: Invest 25% or more of the Fund's total assets in securities of issuers in any particular industry.  For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. Government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions and investments in other registered investment companies are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.  As a matter of fundamental policy, the Fund may not:   Invest 25% or more of its total assets in the securities of issuers primarily engaged in any one industry or group of industries, except that: (A) the Fund will concentrate its investments in issuers in the financial industry or group of industries; and (B) the Fund will concentrate its investments in issuers in the real estate industry or group of industries.  This limitation does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities.

This limitation does not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has reviewed the Fund's existing Concentration Policy and, after careful consideration, has unanimously approved the Concentration Policy Amendment, pending shareholder approval, to facilitate implementation of Fund management's recommended updates to the Fund's investment strategy.  Therefore, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders approve the Concentration Policy Amendment. If approved by shareholders, the Proposal will take effect on or about the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the Fund's Registration Statement that was filed on January 10, 2019 to reflect the proposed investment strategy updates (the "Post-Effective Amendment"). 
Q.  If the Concentration Policy Amendment is approved will the Fund be subject to any additional risks?
A. If the Concentration Policy Amendment is approved, the Fund will be subject to the following additional risks:
 Concentration Risk.  As a general matter, funds with investments concentrated in one or more industries or groups of industries are subject to greater risk than funds with more diversified investments. The Fund will be less diversified than a fund investing in a broader range of securities because it will be concentrated in the financial and real estate industries or groups of industries.  As a result, weaknesses or declines in the prospects, outlook or market sentiment regarding either or both of these industries or groups of industries may adversely affect the prices of these securities, thereby adversely affecting the net asset value ("NAV") of the  Fund.  In addition, to the extent that either of these industries or groups of industries experience adverse economic, market or regulatory changes, these changes may adversely impact the Fund.
 Financial Company Risk.  The Fund will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers that are financial companies than would a fund investing in a more diversified portfolio of securities. In general, financial companies may be more regulated than non-financial companies and, as a result, their businesses and prices of their securities are particularly sensitive to changes in legislation or government regulations.  In addition, entities that are financial companies are particularly vulnerable to certain factors affecting financial companies as a whole, such as the availability and cost of capital funds, changes in interest rates and the rate of corporate and consumer debt defaults.  Economic downturns, credit losses and price and service competition may also negatively affect issuers that are financial companies.  In addition, financial companies are susceptible to evolving technological changes.  These changes may occur rapidly or more slowly, but stock prices for companies that are unable to adapt to as quickly, efficiently or effectively as others are likely to be adversely affected.
 Real Estate and REIT Risk.  The Fund will not invest directly in real estate, but may invest directly or indirectly in securities issued by companies that invest in real estate or interests therein (including, without limitation, investments in mortgage-backed securities), real estate investment trusts ("REITs") or other companies in the real estate business such as real estate brokers, real estate developers, real estate lenders and companies with substantial real estate holdings, which may include, without limitation, paper, lumber, hospitality, entertainment and other companies whose real estate holdings are important to their businesses.  Risks associated with these types of investments include risks related to changes in interest rates; local or state real estate legislation, property tax changes and real estate regulation; declines in the demand for, or value of, residential or commercial real estate; adverse general and local economic conditions; lack of availability of capital; overbuilding in a given market or environmental issues; or factors that raise operating expenses for managing, developing or maintaining real estate or real estate businesses.  Companies that have substantial real estate holdings but whose focuses are on other types of businesses are subject to risks related to those businesses, in addition to risks associated with real estate generally.  REITs are subject to all of the foregoing risks and, in addition, are subject to risks related to the types and locations of the properties the REITs own, how well the REITs manage their properties, competition faced by the REITs' properties, market conditions and other factors. A REIT's performance also depends on the company's ability to finance property purchases and renovations and manage its cash flows. To the extent that REITs are invested in a limited number of projects or in a particular market segment, they may also be more susceptible to adverse developments affecting a single project or market segment than more broadly diversified investments. Q.
Does the Board of Trustees recommend that shareholders vote to approve Concentration Policy Amendment? 
A.
Yes, the Board of Trustees unanimously recommends that the shareholders of the Fund vote FOR approval of the Concentration Policy Amendment.  
Q: 
Who is eligible to vote?
A:    Shareholders of record of the Fund at the close of business on January 23, 2019 are entitled to be present and to vote at the Meeting.  Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each dollar (and a proportionate fractional vote for each fractional dollar) of the net asset value of each share (including  fractional  shares) held by the shareholder on the Record Date. 
Q:
How do I vote?
A:    You can vote in one of the following ways:
1.
Complete, sign, date and promptly return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope; or
2.
Attend the Meeting and vote in person.
Proxy cards that are properly signed, dated and received prior to the Meeting will be voted as specified.  If you specify a vote on any Proposal, your proxy will be voted as you indicate, and any Proposals for which you are entitled to vote but for which no vote is specified will be voted FOR that Proposal.  If you simply sign, date and return the proxy card, but do not specify a vote on any of the Proposals, your shares will be voted FOR all Proposals.
Q:
May I revoke my proxy?
A: 
You may revoke your proxy at any time prior to use by filing with the Secretary of the Trust an instrument revoking the proxy prior to the Meeting, by submitting a proxy bearing a later date, or by attending and voting at the Meeting.
Q:
What will happen if there are not enough votes to have the Meeting?
A:
It is important that shareholders vote by completing and returning signed proxy cards promptly, but no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on February 10, 2019, or attend the Meeting in person, in order to ensure there is a quorum for the Meeting.  You may be contacted by officers of the Trust who will assist you in voting your shares.  If a sufficient number of shares is not present in person or by proxy to have a quorum at the Meeting, or if the Fund has not received enough votes to approve the Concentration Policy Amendment at the Meeting, then the Meeting may be adjourned to a later date so we can continue to seek more votes.
Q:
What happens if the Proposals are not approved?
A:
If the Proposal is not approved with respect to the Concentration Policy Amendment, then the existing Concentration Policy will continue in effect. Q:
Who will pay for the proxy solicitation?
A:
The Adviser has agreed to assume all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with the Meeting and proxy statement, including legal and accounting fees.  The Fund will not bear any of these costs.
Q:
Whom should I call for additional information about the Proxy Statement?
A:
If you have any questions regarding the Proxy Statement or completing and returning your proxy card, you may call the Fund at 855-270-2678  . GATOR SERIES TRUST

If approved by shareholders, the Proposal will take effect on or about the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the Fund's Registration Statement that was filed on January 10, 2019 (the "Post-Effective Amendment").  Shareholder Approval  
To become effective with respect to the Fund, the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for approval of the Concentration Policy Amendment.  The vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund means the vote of the lesser of: (1) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund present or represented by proxy at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.  For purposes of determining the approval of the Concentration Policy Amendment, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as shares voted against the Proposal.
The Board of Trustees unanimously recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote FOR the Concentration Policy Amendment.
PROPOSAL 2:
TO TRANSACT ANY OTHER BUSINESS THAT MAY PROPERLY COME BEFORE THE MEETING OR ANY ADJOURNMENT THEREOF IN THE DISCRETION OF THE PROXIES OR THEIR SUBSTITUTES 
The proxy holders have no present intention of bringing any other matter before the Meeting other than those specifically referred to above or matters in connection with or for the purpose of effecting the same.  Neither the proxy holders nor the Board of Trustees are aware of any matters which may be presented by others.  If any other business shall properly come before the Meeting, the proxy holders intend to vote thereon in accordance with their best judgment.

Quorum.  A quorum is the number of shares legally required to be at a meeting in order to conduct business.  The presence, in person or by proxy, of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Trust is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Meeting.  Proxies properly executed and marked with a negative vote or an abstention will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for the transaction of business.  If the Meeting is called to order but a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote those proxies that have been received to adjourn the Meeting to a later date.  If a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve a Proposal described herein are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy.  The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies received that voted in favor of a Proposal in favor of such an adjournment and will vote those proxies received that voted against the Proposal against any such adjournment.
Abstentions and "broker non-voters" are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but do not represent votes cast with respect to a Proposal.  "Broker non-votes" are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by the Trust, but are not voted as to one or more Proposals because instructions have not been received from the beneficial  owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "broker non-votes" will be excluded from the denominator of the calculation of the number of votes required to approve any Proposal to adjourn the Meeting.  Accordingly, abstentions and "broker non-votes" will effectively be a vote against a Proposal, for which the required vote is a percentage of the outstanding voting shares and will have no effect on a vote for adjournment.

OTHER MATTERS 
Shareholder Proposals 
As a Delaware statutory trust, the Trust does not intend to, and is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders, except under certain limited circumstances.  The Board of Trustees does not believe a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the Board of Trustees is appropriate due to the infrequency of shareholder communications to the Board of Trustees.  The Trust has not received any shareholder proposals to be considered for presentation at the Meeting.  Under the proxy rules of the SEC, shareholder proposals may, under certain conditions, be included in the Trust's proxy statement and proxy for a particular meeting.  Under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Trust's proxy materials must be received by the Trust within a  reasonable time before the solicitation is made.  The fact that the Trust receives a shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not insure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion.  Annual meetings of shareholders of the Fund are not required as long as there is no particular requirement under the Investment Company Act, which must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting.  Any shareholder proposal should be sent to Derek Pilecki, President, Gator Series Trust at 100 South Ashley Drive, Suite 895, Tampa, Florida 33602.
Board Meetings During the Most Recent Fiscal Year
The Board held four (4) meetings during the most recent fiscal year.
Shareholder Communications with Trustees 
Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board or individual Trustees should write to the Board or the particular Trustee, care of the Fund, at the offices of the Trust as set forth below.  All communications will be forwarded directly to the Board or the individual Trustee.
Shareholders also have an opportunity to communicate with the Board at shareholder meetings.  The Trust does not have a policy requiring Trustees to attend shareholder meetings.
Proxy Delivery
The Trust may only send one Proxy Statement to shareholders who share the same address unless the Trust has received different instructions from one or more of the shareholders.  The Fund will deliver promptly to a shareholder, upon oral or written request, a separate copy of the Proxy Statement to a shared address to which a single copy of this Proxy was delivered.  By calling or writing the Fund, a shareholder may request separate copies of future proxy statements, or if the shareholder is receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement now, may request a single copy in the future.  To request a paper or email copy of the Proxy Statement or annual report at no charge, or to make any of the aforementioned requests, call us toll free at 855-270-2678 or write to Gator Series Trust at 100 S.
