Dear Ball Corporation Shareholders, 
On behalf of Ball Corporation's Board of Directors, it is my privilege to write to you to highlight a few of the Corporation's accomplishments and prospects that are outlined in detail in the attached 2019 Proxy Statement. As a Board, we truly believe that Ball is in the middle of a transformative period of growth and success. 
As you review this year's Proxy Statement, please note the new section describing the Corporation's sustainability initiative that emphasizes the customer and consumer benefits of infinitely recyclable aluminum containers in the face of global concerns about plastic packaging. In addition, this year's Compensation Discussion and Analysis reviews the 2018 shareholder listening tour, where management and certain members of the Board of Directors met in person with shareholders holding nearly fifty percent of our shares and communicated with those holding over ninety percent. In these conversations, we received strong affirmation of our disciplined Economic Value Added ("EVA®") filter for both capital allocation and our executive compensation program. Our shareholders and Board of Directors continue to strongly support management's EVA® focus, which has served the Corporation's shareholders well for over two decades. 
In 2018, the Corporation again increased EVA® dollars by generating higher operating earnings, investing in and executing on global growth capital projects in the metal packaging businesses well in excess of our depreciation, investing in our aerospace business to position us for strong expected growth, commercializing the sustainability attributes of the aluminum packaging portfolio, divesting our underperforming U.S. steel food and aerosol assets, announcing the sale of our underperforming China beverage can business, paying down debt and returning approximately $850 million in capital to shareholders. Although EVA® dollars were relatively flat in 2018 versus 2017, the sale of the underperforming businesses and the completion of the key capital and other projects will generate meaningful EVA® dollar growth in future years. 
Ball Corporation has also positioned itself as a leader in overall diversity and inclusion. We have utilized our already strong culture to drive significantly higher our overall diversity metrics across the Corporation, and have used the retirements of several Board members to reconstitute our Board of Directors to more closely resemble the world in which we operate. As a result of this initiative, in January 2019, Ball Corporation was named by Forbes as its #1 Employer for Diversity and Inclusion. 
Based on its review of the Corporation's executive compensation program, the Human Resources Committee is confident that the program and its pay-for-performance metrics have directly contributed to the successful performance of the Corporation over many years and have resulted in an executive team closely aligned with shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the advisory vote approving Ball's executive officer compensation. 
Thank you for your investment in Ball Corporation and for this opportunity to reflect on our recent accomplishments and exciting future, and why I am so proud to be a member of the Ball Corporation team.

    PROXY STATEMENT   March 12, 2019     
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  TO BE HELD WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2019
 Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials  for the Annual Shareholder Meeting  
 The Proxy Statement, Form 10-K and Annual Report are Available  at http://materials.proxyvote.com  
To Shareholders of Ball Corporation: 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy are furnished to shareholders in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Ball Corporation (the "Corporation" or "Ball") of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held April 24, 2019, for the purposes stated in the accompanying notice of the meeting. We are first furnishing and making available to shareholders the proxy materials on March 12, 2019. 
Please submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares can be voted at the meeting. All properly completed proxies submitted by telephone or the Internet, and all properly executed written proxies returned by shareholders who request paper copies of the proxy materials, that are delivered pursuant to this solicitation, will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the directions given in the proxy, unless the proxy is revoked prior to completion of voting at the meeting. Only holders of record of shares of the Corporation's common stock as of the close of business on March 1, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting, or at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. 
Any Ball Corporation shareholder of record as of March 1, 2019, the record date, desiring to submit a proxy by telephone or via the Internet will be required to enter the unique voter control number imprinted on the Ball Corporation proxy card, and therefore should have the proxy card for reference when initiating the process. 
Similar instructions are included on the enclosed proxy card. 
A shareholder of record of the Corporation may revoke a proxy in writing at any time prior to the meeting by sending written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; by voting again by telephone; by voting via the Internet; by voting in writing if you requested your materials in paper copy; or by voting in person at the meeting.  Table of Contents 
  ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING         
Why am I receiving the Proxy Statement? You are receiving the Proxy Statement because you owned shares of Ball Corporation common stock on March 1, 2019, the record date, and that entitles you to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Corporation's Board of Directors ("Board") is soliciting your proxy to vote at the scheduled 2019 Annual Meeting or at any later meeting should the scheduled Annual Meeting be adjourned or postponed for any reason. Your proxy will authorize specified people (proxies) to vote on your behalf at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your written instructions. By use of a proxy, you can vote, whether or not you attend the meeting. 
What will I be voting on? You will be voting on (1) the election of three director nominees named in this Proxy Statement for terms expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders; (2) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019; and (3) an advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers. 
What are the Board of Directors' recommendations? The Board recommends a vote (1) FOR the election of the three director nominees named in this Proxy Statement; (2) FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019; and (3) FOR the advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers. 
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting? We do not know of any other matters that will be raised at the Annual Meeting. The Chairman will allow presentation of a proposal or a nomination for the Board from the floor at the Annual Meeting only if the proposal or nomination was properly submitted. The proxies will have discretionary authority, to the extent permitted by law, to vote for or against other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting as those persons deem advisable. 
How many votes can be cast by all shareholders? Each share of Ball Corporation common stock is entitled to one vote on each of the three directors to be elected and one vote on each other matter that is properly presented at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote my shares if I am a record holder? If you are a record holder of shares; that is, the shares are registered in your name and not the name of your broker or other nominee, you are urged to submit your proxy as soon as possible, so that your shares can be voted at the meeting in accordance with your instructions. You may submit your proxy by telephone or via the Internet as instructed on page 1 of the Proxy Statement and on your proxy card, or you can complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card if you request a paper copy of the proxy materials. You may also vote by attending the Annual Meeting, or sending a personal representative to the Annual Meeting with an appropriate proxy, in order to vote. Unless you or a personal representative plan to be in attendance and vote at the meeting, your vote must be received no later than 11:59 P.M. (EDT) on Tuesday, April 23, 2019. 
How do I vote my shares if I hold my shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") or the 401(k) Plan? Participants may vote their shares in the manner set forth above; however, shares held through the ESPP or the 401(k) Plan must be voted by 11:59 P.M. (EDT) on Sunday, April 21, 2019. The Trustee of the 401(k) Plan will vote the unvoted shares for each voting item in the same proportion as the voted shares for each item. The Administrator of the ESPP will vote the unvoted shares for that Plan in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations. 
How do I vote my shares if I hold my shares in "street name" through a bank or broker? If you hold your shares as a beneficial owner through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like at the meeting. Your bank, broker or other nominee will send you specific instructions in this regard to vote your shares. If you do not provide instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares are voted depends on the type of item being considered for a vote. For example, under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers are permitted to vote on "discretionary" items if the voting instructions from the beneficial owners of the shares are not provided in a timely manner. Brokers are not permitted to vote on "nondiscretionary" items. The proposal to approve the appointment of independent auditors is considered a "discretionary" item. This means that brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on this matter on behalf of clients who have not furnished voting instructions at least ten days before the date of the meeting. In contrast, the other items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are "nondiscretionary" items. This means brokerage firms that have not received voting instructions from their clients on these items may not vote on them. These so-called "broker nonvotes" will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not be considered in determining the number of votes necessary for approval and will have no effect on the outcome of the votes for such items. 
Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote? Shareholders of record may revoke their proxies or change their votes in writing at any time prior to the meeting by sending written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; by voting again by telephone or via the Internet; by voting in writing if they requested their materials in paper copy; or by voting in person at the meeting. Attendance in and of itself at the Annual Meeting will not revoke a proxy. For shares you hold beneficially but not of record, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee or, if you have obtained a valid proxy from your broker or nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person.

  VOTING ITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS         
Pursuant to our Amended Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and the Indiana Business Corporation Law, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with directors serving staggered three-year terms. Amendments to the Indiana Business Corporation Law in 2009 made this classified Board structure statutorily required for Ball Corporation, effective from and after July 31, 2009. On April 24, 2019, three persons are to be elected to serve as directors until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Unless otherwise instructed on the accompanying proxy, the persons named in the proxy intend to vote for nominees Daniel J. Heinrich, Georgia R. Nelson and Cynthia A. Niekamp to hold office as directors of the Corporation until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (Class I), or, in each case, until his or her respective successor is elected and qualified. Each of the nominees has consented to be named as a candidate in the Proxy Statement and has agreed to serve if elected. If, for any reason, any of the nominees becomes unavailable for election, the shares represented by proxies will be voted for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable to serve. 
Robert W. Alspaugh, who has served as a director since 2008 and Theodore M. Solso, who has served as a director since 2003, have reached the retirement age for directors and will both retire at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Corporation wishes to express its sincere appreciation to Messrs. Alspaugh and Solso for their significant contributions to the Corporation and its shareholders during their long and distinguished tenure as directors. 
Under the Corporation's Amended Articles of Incorporation, as amended, in an uncontested election, which is the case at this Annual Meeting, directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. If more "against" than "for" votes are received, the Corporation's Bylaws require the director to tender his or her resignation and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee must make a recommendation to the Board to consider whether to accept the resignation. The relevant Bylaw provisions are set out in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement. For this vote, abstentions and broker nonvotes are considered neither votes "for" nor "against" and will not affect the outcome of the vote. Proxies may not be voted for a greater number of persons than the three named nominees. 
Set forth for each director nominee in Class I and for each continuing director in Classes II and III is the director's principal occupation and employment during the past five years or, if longer, the period during which the director has served as a director, and certain other information, including his or her public company directorships during the past five years. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each nominee for Director named. Table of Contents

Table of Contents 
  BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT         
In April 2013, John A. Hayes was named Chairman of the Board, having been elected a director in 2010. In 2011, prior to his election as Chairman, Mr. Hayes was named President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Mr. Hayes assumed the position of Chairman after more than 14 years with Ball, most recently serving as President and CEO and a member of the Board. 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of Mr. Hayes, as well as 10 other directors, all of whom are independent directors, except for Mr. Hayes and Mr. Mariani. The Board has four standing committees—Audit, Nominating/Corporate Governance, Human Resources and Finance. Each of the committees, except for Finance, is composed solely of independent directors (the Finance Committee is primarily composed of independent directors), with each of the four committees, having an independent director serving as chairman. Mr. Solso has served as Lead Independent Director since April 2013. 
Although the Corporation's Bylaws do not require that the roles of Chairman and CEO be combined, we believe our Corporation and its shareholders are well served by this traditional board leadership model. Having a single person lead the Corporation and the Board provides clear leadership, helps to maintain uniform management vision for the Corporation and the Board and provides efficiency. The Board believes that the CEO is the person best suited to serve as Chairman, because he is the person most familiar with the Corporation's businesses and the most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities and opportunities and leading the Board in the discussion of the execution of the Corporation's strategy. Pursuant to SEC and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, regularly scheduled executive sessions of nonmanagement directors are held. Executive sessions of independent directors are also held at least annually. Such meetings promote open discussion by nonmanagement and independent directors, enabling them to serve as a check on management, if necessary. The meetings of the independent directors are chaired by the Lead Independent Director, who is appointed by the Board. 
In accordance with NYSE requirements, our Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the risk management function of the Corporation. While the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, the entire Board is involved in overseeing risk management for the Corporation. Additionally, each Board committee considers the specific risks within its area of responsibility. Our Internal Audit Department has, for many years, analyzed various areas of risk to the Corporation and has provided risk assessment and analysis to our Audit Committee. In 2007, the Corporation established a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management process which is now supervised by our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, whereby key corporate and divisional risks are systematically identified and assessed on a regular basis. The results of this ongoing risk assessment are reported to our Audit Committee and to our Board at least annually. 
One of the responsibilities of our Board of Directors is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and make recommendations involving its organization and operation. The Board annually conducts a robust self-evaluation process that is discussed at the January meeting of the Directors, following which the Chairman holds detailed one-on-one meetings with each Director to discuss the evaluations and any other matters raised by the Directors. We recognize that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for different companies and at different times. We believe our current leadership structure, with Mr. Hayes serving as Chairman, President and CEO, a Board with a majority of independent directors, an independent chairman for each of our standing Board committees, and separate meetings of nonmanagement and independent directors, led by the Lead Independent Director, provides the most effective form of leadership for our Corporation at this time. We believe that our directors provide effective oversight of risk management through the Board's regular dialogue with Ball management, the Enterprise Risk Management process, annual Board and Committee self-evaluation, and assessment of specific risks within each Board committee's areas of responsibility. 
  BOARD DIVERSITY         
Ball's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee consistently applies the principles of diversity and inclusion that are among our core values, in its consideration of candidates for Board positions. In addition to considering characteristics such as business and professional experience, education and skills, the Committee utilizes a robust director candidate review process that considers a variety of other characteristics, such as race, gender and national origin, all leading to differences of viewpoint and other individual qualities that contribute to Board heterogeneity. This has resulted in a diverse group of talented and capable Board members, as described in more detail under "Director Nominees and Continuing Directors."  Table of Contents
To identify potential Board candidates, the Committee works with a globally-recognized consulting firm, providing particular guidelines and a matrix of specific characteristics that are used to assess Board candidates, which include characteristics of diversity. After a thorough review process by our consultant against the criteria that have been provided, the pool of qualified candidates is presented to the Committee. Selected candidates are further assessed and interviewed by the Committee, considering the values and needs of the Company more closely, including the need for a diverse Board. 
Our Board embodies the principle of diversity. Over the past five years, the Corporation has added six new directors to the Board, each of whom has significantly enhanced the diversity of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, creating a stronger Board as a result. The Committee will continue to identify opportunities to strengthen the diversity of our Board when considering candidates in the future. 
  SUSTAINABILITY         
Sustainability is a key part of our business strategy at Ball. By enhancing the unique sustainability credentials of our products along their life cycles, we position our metal beverage and aerosol containers as the most sustainable packaging choice and help our customers grow their businesses. Aluminum is an infinitely recyclable material. It also has the highest scrap value of all commonly used packaging substrates. These qualities make beverage and aerosol containers an increasingly attractive option for sustainability conscious consumers and brands who acknowledge that metal packaging is a true enabler of a circular economy in terms of economic value, recyclability, real recycling and the avoidance of down cycling. In 2017, Resource Recycling Systems recognized aluminum beverage cans as the most recycled beverage package in the world, with a global weighted average recycling rate for aluminum of 69 percent. This finding solidifies the aluminum can as the leader in real recycling, where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value (product to product or material to material recycling). In comparison, only 43 percent of PET and 46 percent of glass bottles were collected for recycling, although not necessarily recycled. 
In some of Ball's markets such as Brazil, China and several European countries, recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are at or above 90 percent. The most recently available recycling rates for aluminum beverage cans are 97 percent in Brazil in 2017, 74 percent in Europe in 2015, and 49 percent in the U.S. in 2016. 
We focus our sustainability efforts on product stewardship, operational excellence, talent management and community engagement. In our global operations, we work on continuous improvement of employee safety, energy and water efficiency, waste generation and air emissions. 
Because metal recycling saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary metal production, the biggest opportunity to further enhance the positive environmental attributes of metal packaging is to increase recycling rates. In markets where recycling rates are below where we believe they should be, we help establish and financially support packaging collection and recycling initiatives. These initiatives typically focus on collaborating with public and private partners to create effective collection and recycling systems, including education of consumers about the sustainability benefits of metal packaging. 
  GOVERNANCE OF THE CORPORATION         
   Corporate Governance Guidelines         
The Board has established Corporate Governance Guidelines to comply with the relevant provisions of Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the "NYSE Listing Standards"). The Corporate Governance Guidelines are set forth on the Corporation's Website at www.ball.com/investors under "Corporate Governance." A copy may also be obtained upon request from the Corporation's Corporate Secretary. 
   Policies on Business Ethics and Conduct  
Ball established a Corporate Compliance Committee in 1993, which now consists of a focal point in each operating division and which is chaired by a designated Compliance Officer. The Committee provides quarterly reports to management and to the Audit Committee. The Committee also publishes a code of business ethics, which is in the form of the Business Ethics Code of Conduct. The Board has adopted a separate additional business ethics statement referred to as the Ball Corporation Executive Officers and Directors Business Ethics Statement ("Executive Officers and Directors  Table of Contents
Ethics Statement") designed to establish principles requiring the highest level of ethical behavior toward achieving business success within the requirements of the law and the Corporation's policies and ethical standards. The Business Ethics Code of Conduct and the Executive Officers and Directors Ethics Statement are set forth on the Corporation's Website at www.ball.com/investors under "Corporate Governance" and then under "Highlights." Copies may also be obtained upon request from the Corporation's Corporate Secretary. 
   Director Training  
All new directors receive orientation training soon after being elected to the Board. Continuing education programs are made available to directors including internal presentations, third-party presentations and externally offered programs. Four directors attended externally offered director training programs in 2018. 
   Communications With Directors  
The Corporation has established means for shareholders or others to send communications to the Board. Persons interested in communicating with the Board, its individual directors or its committees may send communications in writing to the Corporate Secretary or the Chairman of the Board. The communication should be sent in care of the Corporate Secretary, Ball Corporation, by mail to P.O. Box 5000, Broomfield, Colorado 80038-5000 or facsimile transmission to 303-460-2691.

   Meetings of Nonmanagement and Independent Directors  
The Board meets regularly and not less than four times per year. Nonmanagement directors meet as a separate group at each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting. Independent directors meet at least annually. Theodore M. Solso serves as Lead Independent Director. 
   Director Independence Standards  
Pursuant to the NYSE Listing Standards, the Board has adopted a policy adhering to the director independence requirements of the NYSE in determining the independence of directors. These standards are described on the Corporation's Website at www.ball.com/investors under "Corporate Governance." 
The Board has determined that a majority of the Board is independent. Based upon the NYSE independence standards, during 2018 each of the members of the Board was and currently is independent with the exception of Messrs. Hayes and Mariani. 
  BOARD MEETINGS AND ANNUAL MEETING         
The members of the Board are expected to attend all meetings of the Board, relevant committee meetings and the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board held five meetings during 2018. Every legacy director attended 80% or more of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which the director served. All directors at the time attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. Mr. Bryant attended all Board and applicable committee meetings since his respective appointments.  Table of Contents
  BOARD COMMITTEES         
The Board has an Audit Committee, Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, Human Resources Committee and Finance Committee. 
   Audit Committee  
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee management's conduct and the integrity of the Corporation's public financial reporting process, including the oversight of (1) accounting policies; (2) the system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting; (3) disclosure controls and procedures; (4) the performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Corporation (the "independent auditor"); (5) the Internal Audit Department; and (6) the Corporation's risk management. The Audit Committee is also responsible for engaging and evaluating the Corporation's independent auditor and its lead engagement partner, including the qualifications and independence of both; resolving any differences between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting; reviewing and preapproving all audit and non-audit fees and services provided by the independent auditor; and establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. 
Members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Alspaugh, Bryant (who joined the Committee in December 2018), Cave, Heinrich and Ms. Ross.

The Audit Committee met nine times during 2018. 
The Report of the Audit Committee is set forth later in this Proxy Statement. The Committee has considered the non-audit services provided during 2018 and 2017 by the independent auditor as disclosed below and determined the services were compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence.

   Audit Fees and Services  
The following table represents fees for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Corporation's independent auditor, for 2018 and 2017. Audit fees included the audit of the Corporation's annual Consolidated Financial Statements, reviews of quarterly reports and the auditor's report under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with fees for statutory and subsidiary audits, SEC registration statements, comfort letter and consents.

The Audit Committee's Charter requires management to submit for preapproval all audit, audit-related and non-audit-related services to be performed by the independent auditor. Management and the independent auditor submit a report of fees for review and preapproval by the Committee on a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee requires management and the independent auditor to submit a report at least annually regarding audit, audit-related, tax and all other fees paid by the Corporation to the independent auditor for services rendered in the immediately preceding two fiscal years. The Committee considers whether the fees for non-audit and audit-related services are compatible with maintaining the  Table of Contents auditor's independence and requires management and the independent auditor to confirm this as well. The Audit Committee preapproved 100% of all of the above-referenced fees paid in 2018 and 2017 for services that were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is set forth on the Corporation's Website at www.ball.com/investors, under "Corporate Governance." 
   Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee  
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to identify qualified individuals to become Board members; recommending to the Board the selection of Board nominees for the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders; addressing the independence and effectiveness of the Board by advising and making recommendations on matters involving the organization and operation of the Board, Corporate Governance Guidelines and directorship practices; overseeing the evaluation of the Board and its committees; and reviewing and assessing the Corporation's sustainability activities and performance. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee utilizes the standards set forth below for considering director nominees. 
Members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. Bryant (who joined the Committee in December 2018), Taylor and Solso and Mses. Nelson and Ross.

  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         
Ball Corporation is a leading global manufacturer of aluminum packaging, primarily for beverage, personal care and household products, and is a provider of aerospace technologies, largely for the United States government. The corporation continues to execute its long-term Drive for 10 vision of maximizing value in its existing businesses, expanding into new products and capabilities, aligning with the right customers and markets, broadening its geographic reach, and leveraging its know-how and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage, as well as by deploying capital into growth investments while also divesting inefficient capital. Our business strategy is focused on: making beverage cans the most sustainable package in the supply chain to provide solutions for our customers to the world's plastic pollution crisis while furthering business growth; delivering the financial projections, business cost savings and industry leadership as a result of the Rexam acquisition; effectively executing in our core businesses to best serve our customers; continuously improving and optimizing operations and asset utilization; maximizing the Economic Value Added ("EVA®") returns of capital investments and innovations; and continuously developing our talent network, including a focus on workforce engagement, diversity and inclusion. Throughout, prudent capital allocation and EVA® discipline always underpin active management of our businesses with the ultimate goal of maximizing shareholder value. 
During 2018, strong global demand for aluminum beverage and aerosol packaging products, growth in Ball's aerospace business, and continued long-term focus on earnings and cash flow allowed us to return approximately $850 million to shareholders. In addition, year-over-year EVA® growth in 2018 generated on the corporation's $10 billion of average invested capital led to an annual total shareholder return of 22.7%. The chart below summarizes certain key financial results for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017*:

[END TABLE]
During 2018, the corporation continued to positively focus on its culture and employee engagement. In an all-employee engagement survey, the corporation achieved a sustainable employee engagement rate of 83%, significantly higher than manufacturing and aerospace peers, placing Ball near high performance companies in several categories, and exceeding high performance benchmarks in the areas of community and sustainability. In addition, Ball was named by Forbes as its #1 Employer for Diversity in early 2019. The dedication, clear focus and hard work of our employees, and our recognizing  Table of Contents the importance of knowing who we are, where we are going and what is important, has positioned Ball Corporation to drive long-term value for all stakeholders in 2019 and beyond. 
 Ball's EVA® Focused Business Strategy Drove Key Capital Decisions in 2018—Ball Corporation's vision for the future relies upon its long-held EVA® discipline. All lines of business and strategic initiatives are consistently measured through an EVA® lens. EVA® by simple definition is sales less operating costs ("NOPAT" or net operating profit after-tax) less a cost of capital charge. Ball Corporation has, for more than 25 years, sought to increase total EVA® generated year-on-year so as to deliver sustained shareholder value creation. Requiring each business to earn returns higher than its cost of capital drives managers to make the best long-term decisions for our stakeholders, by intelligently cutting costs through lean initiatives, implementing process efficiencies, undertaking focused outsourcing efforts, investing in innovation, technology and infrastructure capital to drive profitable growth, and turning working capital faster and/or reducing working capital and assets within marginal or underperforming businesses. 
During 2018, some of the company actions to enhance long-term EVA® included:
Although EVA® dollars generated in 2018 were relatively flat as compared to 2017, the sale of the underperforming businesses and the completion of the significant capital and other projects noted above will generate EVA® dollar growth for our shareholders over a multi-year period. 
 Ball's EVA® Disciplined Performance Continues to Deliver for Shareholders—As a result of ongoing execution of our EVA® focused strategy, Ball's stock price closed 2018 at $45.98, an increase of 21.5% over the prior year. Also during 2018, the Corporation paid quarterly cash dividends of 10 cents per share, providing annual dividends of $137 million, and completed $711 million of net repurchases of our common stock. Including reinvested dividends, Ball generated a total return of 22.7% for the same period, significantly above the (20.2%) return for the Dow Jones Containers and Packaging Index and the (6.2%) return for the S&P 500. Since the end of 2015, Ball's total return is 29.8% as compared to 8.5% for the Dow Jones Containers and Packaging Index and 22.6% for the S&P 500. These results are a continuation of the performance delivered over the past number of years and provide a firm foundation for further growth as we complete our 31/2-year synergy capture plans related to the 2016 Rexam PLC acquisition.  Table of Contents
As demonstrated in the charts below, Ball continues to deliver strong, long-term shareholder returns. 
To demonstrate the relative strength of Ball's performance in the market, the graph below compares the cumulative ten-year total return to holders of Ball Corporation's common stock with the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Containers and Packaging Index, tracking the performance of a $100 investment in our common stock (with the reinvestment of all dividends) and in each of the indexes from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2018. 
To illustrate the connection between EVA® and shareholder value, the chart below summarizes a 20-year 93% historical correlation of EVA® dollar returns and share price growth. The chart also shows Ball's demonstrated ability to generate significant EVA® returns, while significantly expanding its invested capital base, which has increased by approximately $8 billion since 1998. Through its continued and disciplined use of EVA® as the lens for strategic decisions, Ball continues to efficiently deploy capital and generate significant shareholder value.  Table of Contents
Additionally, with the completion in 2018 of the pay down of debt incurred to acquire Rexam PLC, the Corporation has reached its target leverage ahead of schedule. Going forward, our strong free cash flow and solid balance sheet provide the flexibility to continue to invest in our packaging and aerospace businesses and to commercialize the sustainability benefits of our metal packaging businesses, while also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Ball will continue its long-standing share repurchase program and by mid-2021 expects to have acquired all shares that were newly issued to complete the Rexam transaction, and will result in the acquisition of approximately 18% of diluted shares outstanding as at the end of 2018. 
 Ball Aligns Compensation with Business Strategy and Shareholder Interests—Ball Corporation is committed to its pay-for-performance and management-as-owners compensation philosophy, which aligns compensation with our business strategy and shareholder value creation. This is illustrated through use of short-term and long-term incentive programs that focus on continuous EVA® dollar growth, TSR, ROAIC and absolute stock price growth. 
In those incentive programs that have EVA® growth-based performance targets, Ball's commitment to shareholder value creation is demonstrated through: Table of Contents
Beyond its programs that are focused on EVA®, Ball further ensures pay-for-performance alignment with shareholder value generation through:
 Favorable Shareholder Engagement Regarding the 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote—The annual proxy statement and Say-on-Pay voting process provides an additional opportunity for the corporation to receive comprehensive feedback from shareholders. Each year, Ball leverages this opportunity to engage its institutional investors' stewardship committees to discuss the company's business performance, board composition, pay practices and sustainability (or ESG) initiatives. Ball averaged 95% shareholder support of its advisory Say-on-Pay proposal over the last five years. However, during 2018, shareholder support declined to 68.7% as a result of a proxy advisory group's recommendation against our pay recommendation. In response to initial feedback on its 2018 proxy statement disclosure, the Corporation publicly disclosed specific financial targets related to a one-time Rexam-related special acquisition incentive plan and an EVA® tutorial to assist shareholders and advisory service providers in their evaluation of the Corporation's consistent, objective, formulaic and well-established EVA® focused short-term incentive program. In addition, the Corporation conducted outreach with over 90% of its institutional shareholders and embarked on a shareholder listening tour, directly meeting with shareholders representing nearly 50% of outstanding shares. During these meetings, management, board members and shareholders discussed Ball's pay practices, long-term use of EVA®, board composition, board skills matrix, employee engagement, progress on diversity and inclusion initiatives and sustainability leadership. Throughout these meetings, shareholders indicated their strong support of the Corporation's use of EVA® in its compensation philosophy and pay practices, and supported its use of the current formulaic target setting in such programs. Further, they favorably responded to the Corporation's long-term strategy, including its position in sustainability and diversity leadership, its successful integration of the 2016 Rexam acquisition, and its ability to produce consistent EVA® and shareholder returns. As a result of this clear shareholder feedback and the Corporation's continued solid financial performance, our board of directors, based upon the recommendation of our compensation committee, unanimously recommended to retain our existing executive compensation program and its pay-for-performance linkage, and continued strong alignment with shareholder value creation.

 Company Compensation Plans Demonstrate Pay-for-Performance and Management-as-Owners Philosophy—The major compensation elements of Ball's pay-for-performance philosophy are shown in the table below, with the page number in the CD&A that details the specifics of each of these components:

 Composition of Ball's NEOs in 2018—This year's NEOs are shown below: 
Mr. Peterson separated from the company in July 2018 to serve as CEO of the joint venture company established when the Corporation sold the majority stake of its U.S. steel food and steel aerosol business. Although he was not an officer of the  Table of Contents
Corporation on December 31, 2018, his 2018 compensation requires his inclusion as a NEO in this CD&A and in the applicable compensation tables that follow. In connection with the transaction with the joint venture partner, Mr. Peterson was provided a bonus incentive, which was payable to him by the company upon the successful closing of the transaction and predicated upon his commitment to lead the joint venture, with an additional requirement that he invest nearly all of such bonus into equity of the new joint venture company, which he has done. Other than this bonus, Mr. Peterson received no severance or other special compensation treatment upon his termination of employment from the Corporation, and was subject to all standard plans and policies. 
 NEO Compensation has a Strong Pay-for-Performance Linkage—Consistent with our pay-for-performance, management-as-owners philosophy described previously, the majority of the target total compensation for our executives is variable based on performance, which constitutes pay at risk. The CEO is eligible to participate in the same executive programs as the other NEOs; however, a larger portion of the CEO's target total compensation is at risk. The following charts represent the mix of target total compensation awarded to Ball's CEO and other NEOs in 2018. As illustrated, 88% of the target total compensation awarded to the CEO and 75% awarded to other NEOs in 2018 was based on elements that are at risk and may vary from year to year depending on business performance. This is generally consistent with competitive market data, which shows that CEOs have 87% and all other NEOs have 73% of their target total compensation based on elements that are at risk. Furthermore, 70% of the CEO's and 55% of the other NEOs' target total compensation was based on long-term performance. Again, this is consistent with competitive market data, which shows that CEOs have 69% and all other NEOs have 52% of their target total compensation based on long-term performance. This emphasis on longer term compensation, through performance based long-term cash and stock awards, ensures a strong continued alignment between Ball's executive ownership and shareholder value creation objectives.  Table of Contents
 Company Compensation Plans are Closely Linked to Business Performance—Ball's fiscal 2018 financial results and the resulting EVA® improvement were directly linked to the pay outcome of our annual short-term incentive plan, since the payout factor is based on the amount of profits generated, in excess of both operating and capital costs, resulting in EVA® in excess of targets, as shown below: 
Likewise, our fiscal year 2018 results reflect a continuation of the successful execution of our business strategy and strong performance in prior years; therefore, pay realized by our NEOs from long-term incentive performance periods completed at 2018 year-end reflects our commitment to improved financial performance and stock price growth, as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan ("LTCIP") 2016-2018 Period           Actual 3-year average ROAIC of 11.4% exceeded the target of 9.0% and exceeded maximum of 11.0%.    Relative TSR versus the S&P 500 subset was at the   45th percentile, which is just below the target of the 50th percentile.   Based on the blended ROAIC and TSR performance relative to targets, all of our NEOs, except for Mr. Peterson, received LTCIP payout equal to 130% of target. Mr. Peterson's award was forfeited upon his  termination.

 NEO Target Compensation Awarded in 2018—After review of competitive market data based on both General Industry and Peer Group, Ball's financial and operational performance, executive compensation consultant and CEO recommendations, tally sheet analysis, executive individual performance, and internal pay comparisons, the Committee authorized the following target total compensation elements for the CEO and other NEOs: Table of Contents
 Ball is Committed to Shareholder-Oriented Corporate Governance—Our governance process ensures that the executive compensation program is appropriately maintained and updated to always meet a standard of excellence in pay-for-performance alignment. Specifically, a number of practices and policies are in place to promote the continuous improvement and accountability of our executive compensation program:
In summary, the Committee is confident that our executive compensation program, along with our management-as-owners culture and our pay-for-performance philosophy, have directly contributed to the successful performance of the business and resulted in an executive team closely aligned with shareholders. Table of Contents 
  COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES AND PHILOSOPHY         
The primary objective of the Corporation's executive compensation program is to attract and retain exceptional leaders and enable them to behave like an owner—one of our key business values. When setting executive compensation, the Corporation applies a consistent approach for all executive officers and intends that the combination of compensation elements closely aligns the executives' financial interests with those of the shareholders. The program is mainly designed to:
Target total compensation is composed of base salary, annual EVA® incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation in the form of both cash and equity. In support of the Corporation's emphasis on significant ownership by key executives, the Corporation delivers long-term incentive opportunities that encourage ownership. Generally, the amount of compensation realized or potentially realizable does not directly impact the level at which future pay opportunities are set. However, when granting equity awards, the Committee reviews and considers both individual performance and the number of outstanding and previously granted equity awards. 
In addition to promoting share ownership, the Corporation's executive compensation objectives and philosophy focus on rewarding performance. This means that shareholder returns along with corporate performance, both short-term and long-term, comprise the largest portion of executive pay. 
  ROLE OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND EXECUTIVE   COMPENSATION CONSULTANT         
The Committee oversees the administration of the executive compensation program and determines the compensation of the executive officers of the Corporation. The Committee is solely composed of nonmanagement directors, all of whom meet the independence requirements of the NYSE. Furthermore, the Committee has retained an independent consultant (the "Consultant") to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Consultant is employed by Pay Governance, LLC, and is engaged by and reports directly to the Committee. Specifically, the Consultant's role is to develop recommendations for the Committee related to all aspects of the executive compensation program and the Consultant works with management to obtain information necessary to develop the recommendations. The Committee assessed Pay Governance's independence in 2018, as required under NYSE listing rules. Based on this review, we do not believe that any conflict of interest exists with the work performed by Pay Governance and consider them to be independent. 
  MARKET REFERENCE POINTS AND PEER GROUPS         
When benchmarking compensation to the competitive market, we use two market reference points for our executive officers. This two-pronged approach provides a spectrum of relevant information on executive compensation levels, practices and trends in the marketplace. The Committee does not target pay to a specific market benchmark but rather considers the range of data presented along with tenure, company performance and individual performance when setting pay for NEOs. The market reference points provided to the Committee typically consist of "General Industry" and "Peer Group" market data. 
"General Industry" market data is presented for all NEOs and reflects the broad talent market in which we compete. The critical skills required by the Corporation's management team have historically been found both inside and outside of the containers and packaging industry, and as such, the Committee believes it is appropriate to focus on General Industry market levels as the primary market reference point for evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation  Table of Contents program. These data are size-adjusted to reflect the relative size of the Corporation or the relevant business unit for the executive. Size-adjusting the data ensures that market levels are being developed for like roles within businesses of similar size and scope. Data for the General Industry are collected from multiple proprietary survey sources published by leading market data providers. 
"Peer Group" market data are reviewed for the CEO and CFO and is composed of companies within the containers and packaging, food, household durable and nondurable goods, and manufacturing industries. The Committee uses the Peer Group data as a transparent reference point for assessing pay levels across similarly-situated CEOs and CFOs. In addition to pay levels, the Committee reviews tenure and performance data across the Peer Group. Data for the Peer Group are collected from publicly disclosed data contained in SEC filings. 
In developing the Peer Group, the Consultant used objective, quantitative financial and industry criteria, as well as qualitative criteria regarding the nature of our business operations. Specifically, the Consultant used the following principles and criteria in identifying the Peer Group companies:

  PROCESS FOR DETERMINING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION         
The Committee reviews and adjusts executive target total compensation levels, including long-term incentive levels in January of each year. 
The Corporation begins the annual process by reviewing each executive officer's target total compensation in relation to the 50th percentile of the market reference points, e.g., General Industry and/or Peer Group. The data is gathered by the Consultant and presented to the Corporation and the Committee in detailed reports providing a comparative analysis of our executive officer compensation to the market data. The Consultant collaborates with the Corporation's Executive Compensation Department when preparing such reports. 
Additionally, the Consultant creates tally sheets for each executive outlining each executive's annual target and actual pay in relation to competitive market information as well as total accumulated pay under various corporate performance scenarios, both recent and projected. The tally sheets are used to analyze and determine executive officer pay recommendations and understand the potential realizable compensation under various performance scenarios. The Consultant also prepares for the Committee an independent review and recommendation of the CEO's compensation. In its deliberations, the Committee meets with the CEO and other members of senior management, as appropriate, to  Table of Contents discuss the application of the competitive benchmarking (pay and performance) relative to the unique structure and needs of the Corporation. 
The CEO's target total compensation package is set by the Committee during an executive session based on the Committee's review of the recommendation prepared by the Consultant, peer and competitive information, including their assessment of the CEO's relative tenure and associated individual performance, the financial and operating performance of the Corporation, and appropriate business judgment. 
A recommendation for the target total compensation of the Corporation's other executive officers, including the CFO and other NEOs, is made by the CEO after reviewing the executive's and the Corporation's business performance in conjunction with the executive's responsibility and experience when compared to the competitive market information prepared by the Consultant. The compensation package for the other executive officers is established by the Committee taking into consideration the recommendation of the CEO, the executive officer's individual job responsibilities, experience and overall performance, along with appropriate business judgment. 
The Committee may also adjust an executive's compensation level during the year as a result of a promotion. Such adjustments take into consideration competitive market data and a recommendation provided by the Consultant, as well as the recommendation of the CEO, which takes into account the additional responsibilities assigned and overall experience and performance of the executive. 
ELEMENTS OF BALL'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND 2018 PERFORMANCE  
The primary elements of the Corporation's executive compensation program are designed to be consistent with the compensation objectives described previously. The elements are outlined in the following table. The purpose of each element is also provided to demonstrate how each fits with the overall compensation objectives, specifically, stock ownership and pay-for-performance.

 SPECIFICS RELATED TO THE 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS  
When determining our executive target total compensation decisions in January 2018, the Committee took into account the Corporation's operating and financial performance in 2017, which resulted in a total return to shareholders of 1.8%, based on stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends, compared to a 19.4% return of the S&P 500 and the 16.7% return of the Dow Jones Containers and Packaging Index. The Corporation also increased EVA® dollars from $198.6 million in 2016 to $240.4 million in 2017, representing a 21% increase. The Committee also recognized that all NEOs contributed to the many other successes of the Corporation, including: (1) successfully achieving sourcing and footprint synergies related to the Rexam acquisition, (2) implementing cost-out and value-in initiatives across our corporate functions and opening two shared service centers in Serbia and Mexico, (3) investing capital to meet global high single-digit volume growth for specialty beverage containers, (4) expanding our global reach by completing investments in aluminum aerosol facilities in India and the Czech Republic, (5) leveraging our global capabilities in metal manufacturing to drive sustainability solutions for our customers, and (6) successfully delivering multiple aerospace technologies and instruments to government and commercial customers throughout 2017 which improved year-over-year financial performance. During 2017, the Corporation was again recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for maintaining our position as the only packaging company to be listed on both the North American and World indexes, and also received a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality, administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
   Base Salary  
Base salary levels are set on the basis of factors such as job responsibilities, the CEO's subjective judgment of individual performance and contributions to overall business performance, tenure and experience level, internal merit increase budgets, external market base salary movement and market competitiveness as compared to 50th percentile data. With respect to promotions, we may initially position an individual below the 50th percentile and then adjust their base pay closer to the market median over time, in order to ensure that the individual is successfully performing and growing into their new role. The Committee reviewed base salary levels during the executive compensation review as outlined under  Table of Contents the section entitled "Process for Determining Executive Compensation," which included an analysis of external market data, prepared by the Consultant and approved salary increases for all NEOs in late January 2018, with changes effective retroactively to January 1, 2018. 
   Annual Incentive  
This short-term annual pay-for-performance incentive is used to encourage and reward the NEOs for making decisions that improve performance as measured by EVA®. As mentioned in the "Executive Summary," it is designed to produce sustained shareholder value by establishing a direct link between EVA® improvement and incentive compensation. EVA® was selected, over 25 years ago, as the measure for Ball's Annual Incentive Compensation Plan because it has been demonstrated to correlate management's incentive with share price growth and shareholder returns. EVA® is calculated by subtracting a charge for the use of invested capital from net operating profit after-tax as illustrated below: 
Generating profits in excess of both operating and capital costs (debt and equity) creates EVA® dollars. If EVA® improves, value has been created. 
 Performance Measures—The plan design motivates continuous improvement in order to achieve payouts at or above target over time. Targets are established annually for each operating unit and for the Corporation as a whole based on prior performance. To allow for transparency with employees and shareholders, and to avoid unnecessary subjectivity and internal budget negotiations regarding short-term incentive annual performance targets, Ball follows a best practice approach to goal-setting that follows a consistent, objective, formulaic methodology that continuously focuses on EVA® dollar growth. This process is core to EVA® mechanics, requires consistent incremental value creation and allows for direct employee engagement in achieving desired results that are aligned with shareholder interests.  Table of Contents 
The Corporation's and/or operating unit's EVA® financial performance determines the amount, if any, of awards earned under the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan. Such awards are based on actual EVA® performance relative to the established EVA® target. For any one year, the EVA® target is equal to the sum of the prior year's target EVA® plus one-half the amount of the prior year's EVA® gain or shortfall relative to the prior year's EVA® target and is calculated as follows: 
Improvement in EVA® occurs when the amount of NOPAT, less a charge for capital employed in the business, increases over time. It establishes a direct link between annual incentive compensation and continuous improvement of return on invested capital relative to an internal minimum 9% after-tax "hurdle rate." The Corporation has established a minimum 9% after-tax as the hurdle rate when evaluating capital expenditures and strategic initiatives in most regions in which we do business, and requires hurdle rates higher than this for investments in emerging countries or new technologies. These hurdle rates are above the Corporation's estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 6%, which provides built-in greater returns for shareholders. 
For a given year, a payout at 100% of target annual incentive compensation is achieved when actual EVA® is equal to the EVA® target. Actual annual incentive payments each year can range from 0% to 200% of the targeted incentive opportunity based on corporate performance and/or the performance of the operating unit over which the executive has responsibility. For the Corporation's consolidated plan, a payout of 0% is realized when actual EVA® is $174 million less than targeted EVA®. A payout of 200% or greater may be achieved if actual EVA® is $87 million or higher than target EVA®. However, any amounts over 200% of target are banked and remain at risk until paid over time in one-third increments whenever actual performance under the Annual Incentive Plan results in a payout of less than 200% of target. When the bank balance falls below $10,000 it is paid in full. All payments from the bank balance are made at the same time annual incentive payments are made. In 2018, the Corporation's consolidated actual EVA® performance exceeded our EVA® target by $28.2 million and resulted in a payout of 132% of target, as shown below: 
Mr. Fisher's and Mr. Peterson's EVA® targets were based on a combination of their respective operating units' financial and EVA® goals and the Corporation's consolidated plan; however, due to the competitively sensitive nature of such financial metrics, these values have been excluded. 
 Target Incentive Percentages and 2018 Incentive Paid—A target incentive opportunity is established each year as a percentage of an executive's annual base salary and is targeted at approximately the 50th percentile of the competitive market with the opportunity to earn more for above-target performance or less for below-target performance. The 2018 target incentive opportunity for Messrs. Hayes, Morrison, Baker and Ms. Pauley was dependent upon the Corporation's consolidated EVA® performance; whereas for Mr. Fisher, 80% was dependent upon the EVA® performance of the Global Beverage Packaging operating unit and 20% dependent upon the Corporation's consolidated EVA® performance, and for Mr. Peterson, 80% was dependent upon the EVA® performance of the legacy Food & Aerosol Packaging operating unit and 20% dependent upon the Corporation's consolidated EVA® performance.  Table of Contents
The table below summarizes for each NEO the 2018 target incentive opportunity as compared to the actual incentive paid as a result of the year's strong EVA® performance. The value paid may include a one-third increment of a prior bank balance.

Certain U.S.-based executives, including the NEOs, may elect to defer the payment of all or a portion of their annual incentive compensation into the 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan and/or the 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan, as described in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" section. 
   Long-Term Incentives  
This element of compensation is designed to provide ownership and cash opportunities to promote the achievement of longer term financial performance goals and enhanced TSR. The Corporation's long-term incentive opportunity is generally provided through a combination of equity and cash awards, which the Committee believes best matches the compensation principles for the program. 
For 2018, the target award mix of long-term incentive vehicles was 20% LTCIP, 40% Stock Options and 40% PC-RSUs. The total target amount of long-term incentives, based on the grant date expected value, is generally established in relation to the 50th percentile of the competitive market, individual roles and responsibilities, individual performance (as outlined in the preceding "Base Salary" section) and the Corporation's financial and operating performance.

[END TABLE]
The long-term incentive awards provide value only if the Corporation achieves positive stock price and financial performance. This emphasis on long-term compensation, through performance-based long-term cash and equity awards, ensures a strong continued alignment with the Corporation's executive ownership and shareholder value creation objectives. 
 Performance-Based Cash Awards—The Corporation's performance-based long-term cash incentive award, LTCIP, is intended to focus executives on the achievement of multiyear performance goals that will enhance shareholder value. The Corporation's TSR and ROAIC are considered in determining the amount, if any, of awards earned under the Corporation's LTCIP. Performance is measured on a cumulative basis over a three-year performance period. Awards pursuant to the LTCIP are generally made on an annual basis such that three performance periods overlap.  Table of Contents
Any actual award earned is paid at the end of the three-year performance period. During 2018, there were three overlapping periods:
The LTCIP provides executives the opportunity to earn awards based on a combination of two performance measures. One-half of the award is based on the Corporation's three-year TSR as measured against the TSRs of a subset of companies in the S&P 500, excluding companies in the S&P 500 Index that are classified as being part of the Financial or Utilities industry sectors or the Transportation industry group. Companies added to the S&P 500 during the performance period are also excluded. TSR is measured by comparing the average daily closing price and dividends of the Corporation in the third year of the performance period with the average daily closing price and dividends prior to the start of the performance period relative to the distribution of the equivalent TSRs during the performance period of the group of companies as described above. The target performance requirement for the TSR measure is the 50th percentile of the S&P 500 subset described above. 
The other one-half of the award is based on average ROAIC performance over the three-year period. ROAIC is calculated by dividing the average of the Corporation's net operating profit after-tax over the relevant performance period by its average invested capital over such period. The minimum performance threshold of 7% is greater than, and the target performance requirement of 9% is measurably greater than, the Corporation's estimated WACC. As such, management is not rewarded until shareholder value has been created and these performance requirements ensure management is focused on driving such value. 
In summary, the target, minimum and maximum performance requirements are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                  Performance Measure              Minimum              Target              Maximum              ​  
     TSR   37.5th percentile   50th percentile   75th percentile     
         ​                   ROAIC (after-tax)                  7%                   9%                  11%                  ​  
[END TABLE]
For each measure, minimum performance results in a zero payout factor, target performance results in a 100% payout factor and maximum performance results in a 200% payout factor for the respective one-half of the award. Performance between minimum, target and maximum is extrapolated to determine the payout factor. 
Each NEO's incentive opportunity is established by considering external long-term incentive market data and the Corporation's internal pay equity. Each NEO's LTCIP opportunity is set as a fixed target dollar amount based on the 20% target award mix of long-term incentive vehicles, which ensures that the value of Ball's long-term incentives remain consistent with competitive market practices. 
The executive's award for any given performance period is calculated as follows:  Table of Contents
For the 2018-2020 performance period, the fixed target dollar incentive opportunities awarded in early 2018 to the NEOs, and reported in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table," are as follows:

As a result of the Corporation's actual performance for the 2016-2018 performance period of 45th percentile TSR and 11.4% ROAIC, cash payouts (made in early 2019) to the NEOs, except Mr. Peterson, who forfeited his award upon his termination) are 130% of the target opportunities and reported in the "Summary Compensation Table." 
 Equity-Based Awards—The Corporation's equity awards may be provided through various forms (SARs, Incentive Stock Options ("ISOs"), Non-Qualified Stock Options ("NQSOs"), PC-RSUs, restricted stock and RSUs), all of which are tied to the price of Ball Corporation common stock. Annual equity awards associated with target total compensation are typically granted in January on the date of the quarterly meeting of the Board; however, equity awards may be granted during the year as part of an executive's promotion, extraordinary performance or for retention purposes. In the case of newly hired executives, equity awards may be granted upon the executive joining the Corporation. Annual equity-based awards are determined for each NEO in order to bring target total compensation to the level deemed appropriate by the Committee in relation to the external market 50th percentile and each executive's roles, responsibilities and performance. 
In January 2018, the Committee approved the award of NQSOs and PC-RSUs to the NEOs and executive officers. Each form of equity is described below. The target values of these awards were based on the total target award mix of long-term incentive vehicles as previously described (40% NQSOs and 40% PC-RSUs). The number and/or value of the equity awarded in 2018 to the NEOs is reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table." All equity awards are pursuant to the provisions of the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan.  Table of Contents

RSUs granted pursuant to the DSP are made on the 15th day of each month following the participant's submission of adequate documentation to the Corporation detailing the acquisition of the newly acquired shares. No new opportunities were awarded to the NEOs in 2018. 
   Retirement Benefits  
The Corporation strives for overall benefits to be competitive with the market. The NEOs participate in the same benefit plans and on the same terms as provided to all U.S. salaried employees, with the exception of the differences noted below. 
Included in these benefits for the U.S. salaried employees are the annual pension accruals under the qualified pension plan ("Salaried Pension Plan") and contributions to the qualified 401(k) savings plan. The Corporation sponsors two qualified salaried defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., one covering its Aerospace subsidiary's employees and the other covering all other U.S. salaried employees. Prior to January 1, 2007, the benefits were determined by final average salary, covered compensation and years of service. Beginning in 2007, the benefit in both plans is an accumulated annual credit based on base salary, the Social Security Wage Base ("SSWB") and a multiplier that is based on service. 
The 401(k) savings plan is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan that allows U.S. salaried employees, including the NEOs, to contribute to the plan 1% to 55% of their base salary up to IRS-determined limits on a before-tax basis. Prior to January 1, 2007, the Corporation matched 50% of the first 6% of base salary contributed to the plan. Beginning in 2007, the Corporation matches 100% of the first 3% of base salary contributed, and 50% of the next 2% of base salary contributed, up to a maximum match of 4% of base salary contributed. 
Certain executives, including the NEOs, also receive benefits under the non-qualified SERP which replaces benefits otherwise available in the qualified pension plan except for limits on covered compensation in the qualified plan set by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The SERP is designed to provide retirement benefits that are calculated on base salary that exceeds the maximum amount of pay that can be included in the pension calculation under a pension plan that is tax qualified under the Code. Further information regarding the Salaried Pension Plan and the SERP are provided in the "Pension Benefits" section. 
The Corporation's U.S. pension plans and SERP provide pension benefits based on base salary only and do not include incentive compensation as part of the pension calculation. 
Additionally, the Corporation provides a deferred compensation benefit to certain U.S. employees, including the NEOs. Under the terms of the deferred compensation program, participants are eligible to defer current annual incentive compensation to be paid and/or RSUs to be issued in the future. When amounts are deferred, the participant becomes a general unsecured creditor of the Corporation and deferred amounts become subject to claims on the same basis as other general unsecured creditors to the Corporation. The deferred compensation plans provide a means for participants to accumulate funds for retirement or other purposes. 
  OTHER EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND GUIDELINES         
   Plan Terms and Procedures  
In 2018, the annual and long-term incentives awarded were established and paid to the NEOs pursuant to the terms of the Ball Corporation Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan and the Ball Corporation Annual EVA® Incentive Compensation Plan, which are administered by the Committee. The Ball Corporation Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan permit grants of cash awards, stock options, SARs or stock awards (e.g., shares, restricted stock and RSUs) in an equivalent manner. 
   Risk Assessment  
The Committee continually reviews the relationship between risk and reward in our compensation programs; both through recurring in-depth reviews and ongoing review of any program changes as they occur. At this time, the Committee does not believe that these compensation programs encourage excessive or inappropriate risk. The  Table of Contents
Corporation's internal assessment of risk confirms that our compensation arrangements do not foster undue risk taking. They are performance driven and have strong governance and control mechanisms. 
The Committee's executive compensation Consultant conducted a thorough risk assessment of our executive compensation programs in 2018, and reported on this to the Committee. The Consultant reviews a number of criteria regarding compensation design and governance and whether financial risks, operational risks or reputational risks may be generated through any of our programs, policies or practices. The Consultant concluded that they did not identify any elements within Ball's compensation programs and processes that pose material risk to the Corporation. The basis for the Consultant's conclusion is that the Corporation's incentive plans and processes are well designed, diversified and appropriately structured to mitigate risk without diluting incentives for high performance. 
   Stock Ownership Guidelines  
Consistent with its stock ownership philosophy, the Corporation has established guidelines for senior management. The 2018 stock ownership guidelines (minimum requirements) are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Executive              Ownership Multiple   (of Base Salary)   
 CEO   5 times 
         CFO, EVPs and SVPs                   3 times 
 Other Executives   1 to 2 times  
[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, all executive officers including the NEOs have met their ownership guidelines. Furthermore, the Corporation has established a stock ownership guideline for each nonmanagement director, equal to five times their annual fixed retainer amount, and all have met their ownership guidelines with the exception of Ms. Ross and Mr. Bryant, who joined the Board in October 2017 and September 2018, respectively, and are in the process of attaining shares within the required period. 
   Anti-Hedging Policy  
The Corporation does not allow an executive or director to lock in some or all of any company share price appreciation, which would neutralize the economic risk associated with holding Ball Corporation common stock. However, executives and directors are permitted to use contracts to purchase or sell Ball Corporation common stock including pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1, subject to preapproval and applicable rules. Put and call options and other hedging transactions involving Corporation stock (including selling the stock "short") are not permitted. 
   Severance and Change in Control Benefits  
The NEOs are covered by arrangements that specify payments in the event the executive's employment is terminated. The type and amount of payments vary by executive level and whether the termination is following a change in control of the Corporation. These severance benefits, which are competitive with General Industry practices, are payable only if the executive's employment is terminated as specified in each of the agreements. Further discussion is provided in the "Other Potential Post-Termination Employment Benefits" section. 
   Accounting and Tax Considerations  
When establishing pay elements or associated programs, the Committee reviews projections of the estimated pro forma expense and tax impact of all material elements of the executive compensation program. Generally, an accounting expense is accrued over the requisite service period of the particular pay element, which in many cases is equal to the performance period, and the Corporation may realize a tax deduction upon payment to and/or realization by the executive. 
The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") passed in late 2017 significantly amended Code Section 162(m), effective for tax years beginning in 2018. Prior to 2018, Code Section 162(m) generally provided that publicly-held corporations may not deduct in any one taxable year certain compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the CEO or any other executive officer (other than the CFO) whose total compensation is required to be disclosed in the "Summary Compensation  Table of Contents
Table" by reason of being the next three most highly-compensated executive officers, or former executive officers, as may be required ("covered employees"), other than certain performance-based compensation which was exempt from the $1 million limit. Among the various changes of the TCJA, it amended Code Section 162(m) by repealing the exemption of qualifying performance-based pay, including the CFO as a covered employee and providing that an individual who is a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016 will continue to be a covered employee for all subsequent taxable years in which the individual receives compensation from the Corporation. The Corporation intends to take advantage of existing transition rules which may allow payments to be deductible based on the application of the Section 162(m) rules in effect prior to the TCJA changes, based on the belief that certain compensation arrangements were made pursuant to written binding contracts that were in effect on November 2, 2017, and have not been materially modified. The Corporation and the Committee may make prospective changes to compensation to NEOs and related policies to comply with this legislation and maximize the potential deductibility of such compensation by the Corporation. 
In April 2017, the Committee approved one new deferred compensation plan for nonmanagement Directors that incorporates rules applicable to non-qualified deferred compensation as provided by Code Section 409A regulations. 
Beginning January 1, 2006, the Corporation began accounting for stock-based awards including current and prior year stock options, SARs, restricted stock and RSUs in accordance with the requirements of Topic 718, which addresses accounting for stock compensation. 
In December 2005, the Committee approved three new deferred compensation plans that incorporate rules applicable to non-qualified deferred compensation as provided by Code Section 409A regulations. In 2008, the Corporation reviewed and updated all plans and agreements to conform to Code Section 409A final regulations. 
Code Section 280G considerations related to tax reimbursements made to executives for taxes on amounts paid in the event of termination following a change in control are discussed in the narrative to the "Other Potential Post-Termination Employment Benefits" section. 
  TABLES AND NARRATIVES         
Set forth on the following pages are tables showing, for the CEO, CFO, the three other highest paid executive officers and one former executive officer of the Corporation, the following: (1) fiscal year 2018 elements of compensation in summary form; (2) equity and non-equity incentives awarded in 2018; (3) outstanding stock options and stock awards held as of December 31, 2018; (4) the value realized on stock options or SARs exercised and stock awards that vested during 2018; (5) information regarding non-qualified deferred compensation; (6) projected pension benefit values; and projections for other potential post-employment benefits. The "Director Compensation Table" summarizes the fiscal year 2018 elements of compensation for the Corporation's nonmanagement directors. Accompanying each table are narratives and/or footnotes intended to further the understanding of the information disclosed in the tables. The tables should be read in conjunction with the CD&A beginning on page 19, which explains the Corporation's compensation objectives and philosophy, its process for determining executive compensation and a description of the elements of compensation. 
  SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE         
The "Summary Compensation Table" represents all fiscal year 2018 elements of compensation for the Corporation's NEOs including: Table of Contents
The 2018 payout factors used to determine the amounts earned for the Annual EVA® Incentive Compensation Plan and LTCIP for the NEOs are provided in the "2018 Performance Outcome" column under "Elements of Ball's Executive Compensation Program and 2018 Performance." 
In addition to these elements of compensation, the table also presents the change in 2018 in the value of pensions payable at age 65 for the NEOs as well as above-market earnings associated with non-qualified deferred compensation. Certain of the Corporation's predecessor deferred compensation plans provide for an interest rate that is equal to the Moody's Seasoned Corporate Bond Index ("Moody's") and in some plans, an interest rate that is 5 percentage points higher than Moody's, and in others, a fixed interest rate equal to 9%. No additional deferrals are permitted into these plans. Any earnings credited to accounts within plans that provide the Moody's rate plus 5 percentage points and/or the 9% fixed interest that is in excess of above-market earnings that would have been credited at a rate that is 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate have been classified as above-market earnings on deferred compensation. 
The "All Other Compensation" column represents the sum of the values of:
The individual values are disclosed in the "All Other Compensation Table" that follows the "Summary Compensation Table." 
Details regarding post-employment compensation are discussed in the section entitled "Other Potential Post-Employment Benefits."  Table of Contents 
   Summary Compensation Table  
Reflects the fair value of Special Acquisition-Related Incentive Program ("SAIP") RSU awards granted in 2016, and considered granted in 2017 for accounting purposes, calculated in accordance with Topic 718 assuming the probable outcome. The assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K in Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. At the maximum number, the values for SAIP RSUs are: Mr. Hayes $3,871,235; Mr. Morrison $2,083,376; Mr. Fisher $1,783,040; Mr. Baker $1,540,240; and Ms. Pauley $1,451,224. These respective award amounts were based on the Committee's assessment of each NEO's anticipated contribution to the integration of the Rexam business and the execution of ancillary opportunities. Mr. Peterson's award was forfeited upon his termination.  
Mr. Hayes—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $2,400,576; LTCIP $1,501,500; no portion of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.   Mr. Morrison—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $784,358 ; LTCIP $348,400; and $100,000 of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.   Mr. Fisher—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $690,647; LTCIP $117,000; and $125,000 of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.   Mr. Baker—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $511,679; LTCIP $175,500; and $100,000 of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.   Ms. Pauley—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $552,392; LTCIP $167,700; no portion of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.   Mr. Peterson—Annual Incentive Compensation Plan $246,259; no portion of the annual incentive was deferred in February 2019.  
Mr. Hayes—$66,927 aggregate change in pension value and $6,256 above-market earnings on deferred compensation.   Mr. Morrison—$49,726 aggregate change in pension value.   Mr. Fisher—$23,636 aggregate change in pension value.   Mr. Baker—$76,938 aggregate change in pension value and $31,795 above-market earnings on deferred compensation.   Ms. Pauley—$22,123 aggregate change in pension value and $958 above-market earnings on deferred compensation.   Mr. Peterson—($11,394) aggregate change in pension value.  
The change in pension value includes benefit accruals during 2018 and the impact of changes in assumptions from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018. The discount rate for this time period increased from 3.46% to 4.19%, which decreased the present value of the pension benefits.  Table of Contents

  GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE         
The "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" summarizes the plan-based awards granted by the Corporation to the NEOs during 2018, which includes the following:
Awards made under the Annual EVA® Incentive Compensation Plan are determined based on EVA® performance. For the NEOs, awards can range from 0% to 200% of target. Amounts earned in excess of 200% are banked and may be paid over time in one-third increments based on corporate and/or operating unit performance. 
Awards under the LTCIP are granted on an annual basis and are determined based on the Corporation's TSR relative to the subset of S&P 500 companies described in the CD&A as well as the Corporation's ROAIC. The award made in 2018 is for the three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2020. 
PC-RSUs were granted to the NEOs in 2018. The awards will cliff vest after the performance period if the Corporation's performance measure and basis for the degree of vesting of the units, which is based on a future target value of absolute EVA® dollars generated in excess of Ball's 9% after-tax hurdle rate as the capital charge, relative to compound growth rate targets is achieved over a three-year period. PC-RSUs awarded in 2018 have a potential outcome to the executive from 0% to 200%. NQSOs were granted to the NEOs in 2018. The awards vest annually in 25% increments starting on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon exercise, each NEO can either purchase shares of the Corporation's stock at the grant price or, if the price of the Corporation's stock increases, receive the value of the appreciation over the original grant price in cash.  Table of Contents
A DSP opportunity was not provided to the NEOs in 2018; however, a DSP opportunity was previously offered in 2016. Ms. Pauley and Messrs. Hayes, Morrison, Baker and Peterson acquired common shares in 2016; Messrs. Fisher and Peterson acquired common shares in 2017; and Mr. Fisher acquired common shares in 2018, to fulfill this DSP requirement. 
Dividends or dividend equivalents, for RSUs granted prior to April 26, 2017, are paid quarterly on the number of unvested restricted shares or RSUs accounted for on the record date used for determining dividends payable to shareholders and at the same dividend rate as paid to shareholders. Dividend equivalents related to PC-RSUs granted pursuant to the 2013 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan will be accrued and paid only if the performance condition is achieved and the restrictions on the units lapse. Additionally, dividend equivalents related to all RSUs granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2013 Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, effective April 26, 2017, are accrued and paid only if the vesting condition is achieved and the restrictions on the units lapse. 
The vesting of plan-based awards may be accelerated as described in the narrative to the "Other Potential Post-Employment Benefits Table."

OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED IN 2018  
The following table summarizes for each NEO the options exercised and the stock awards vested during 2018. The options that were exercised by each NEO were granted in prior years and became exercisable pursuant to a prescribed vesting schedule. The value realized on exercise reflects the appreciation in the stock price from the option base price on grant date to the exercise date and is reported on a before-tax basis. The shares acquired upon vesting for each NEO were for RSUs granted in prior years that vested pursuant to a prescribed vesting schedule. The value realized reflects the closing stock price on the vesting date and is also reported on a before-tax basis. NEOs can defer the receipt of units of certain awards into the Ball Corporation 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan, pursuant to which distributions may take place no earlier than the participant's separation from service. Information regarding the 2005 Deferred Compensation Company Stock Plan is provided in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" section that follows. Footnotes are provided to detail circumstances when amounts realized upon vesting were deferred. The value realized on vesting also includes the vested value of dividend equivalents paid during 2018 on outstanding RSUs or payment on accrued dividend equivalent earned for the 2015-2017 PC-RSU period.

Table of Contents
  PENSION BENEFITS         
Retirement benefits are provided to the NEOs under a qualified salaried defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). The "Pension Benefits Table" shows each NEO's number of years of credited service, present value of accumulated benefits and payments during fiscal year 2018 for the qualified plan and the SERP. The present value of the accumulated benefit is the December 31, 2018, value of the annual benefit that was earned as of December 31, 2018. 
The Corporation offers two qualified salaried defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. that provide the same benefits. One plan covers its Aerospace subsidiary's salaried employees and the other covers all other U.S. salaried employees. The NEOs are covered under the latter. The qualified plans were designed to provide tax-qualified pension benefits that are generally available to all U.S. salaried employees. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation changed the formula by which the accrued pension benefit under the plans is determined. Prior to January 1, 2007, the accrued pension benefit expressed as a monthly annuity payable at age 65 was based on final average salary, covered compensation and years of service. Effective January 1, 2007, the accrued pension benefit is a monthly annuity that is equivalent to a lump sum payable when the participant reaches age 65 calculated on base salary each year, the Social Security Wage Base ("SSWB") and a multiple based on years of service. Payments of accrued benefits earned may be in the form of an annuity, lump sum or a combination of both, depending on the election of the participant at retirement. The Corporation also sponsors a non-qualified SERP that mirrors the pension plans and is designed to replace the benefits that would have been provided under the pension plans if they were not subject to IRS-imposed limits. Under the Code, the maximum permissible benefit from the qualified plans for retirement in 2018 is $220,000 and annual compensation exceeding $275,000 in 2018 cannot be considered in computing the maximum permissible benefit under the plans. 
   Terms for U.S.-Accrued Benefits Prior to January 1, 2007  
The monthly accrued benefit for benefits earned prior to January 1, 2007, was determined according to the following formula:
Final Monthly Average Salary is calculated based on the highest average for any 60 consecutive months out of the last 120 months through December 31, 2006. 
Covered Compensation is an average of the SSWB in effect during a NEO's career. The SSWB is the maximum monthly amount of income on which FICA taxes are due. The years included in the average are the 35 years ending in the year the NEO is eligible for an unreduced social security benefit. This portion of the benefit formula accounts for the fact that social security does not cover earnings over a certain level. 
Benefit Service is a NEO's service as a salaried employee with the Corporation plus any service with a predecessor plan as appropriate. Participants are 100% vested in their benefit at the time they are credited with five or more years of service with the Corporation. 
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65 with a minimum of five years of benefit service, but a participant may elect to receive payment upon termination or at any time after reaching age 55. Benefits paid before age 65 are subject to reduction based on the age and service at termination. Participants who terminate employment after age 55 with at least ten years of vesting service will receive a reduction of benefit equal to 4% for each year that benefit commencement age precedes age 65 but is greater than age 60, and a 6% reduction for each year that benefit commencement age precedes age 60. Benefits for participants not meeting these requirements are reduced for payment prior to age 65 on an actuarial equivalent basis.  Table of Contents
   Terms for U.S.-Accrued Benefits Beginning January 1, 2007  
The monthly annuity, which is the equivalent of a lump sum benefit payable at age 65, is based on a percentage of the participant's base pay each year as follows: 
Base pay is the NEO's base salary during the calendar year excluding incentive compensation, severance pay or vacation payouts. 
Upon termination or retirement, the vested pension benefit accrued beginning January 1, 2007, may be paid to the participant in either a lump sum or an annuity. If the benefit is paid prior to age 65, the benefit will be reduced 5% compounded annually for each year the payment is made before such age. 
   Terms for U.S. SERP Accrued Benefits  
Since the SERP mirrors the U.S. qualified pension plan, the formulas for deriving the SERP accrued benefits are the same as those described for the pension plans; however, the amount of retirement benefit the participants receive is equal to the difference between the benefit calculated without IRS limits and the benefit calculated with IRS limits. Effective January 1, 2007, the SERP was amended by the Committee to provide participants with benefits accrued as of December 31, 2006, a one-time option to elect the form of payment under which the participant will receive benefits in the future. The payment options available consist of various annuities and a lump sum. For all SERP benefits accrued beginning January 1, 2007, participants will receive benefits only in the form of a lump sum. In accordance with Code Section 409A, payments from the SERP will commence six months after termination of employment. The SERP was also amended to provide that when determining lump sum payments, the SERP would use the same assumptions that exist in the salaried retirement plans except that the interest rate used shall be equal to four-fifths of the interest rate used to determine lump sum benefits under those salaried retirement plans in recognition that payments from the SERP cannot be rolled into a tax-deferred account such as an IRA. 
   Present Value Assumptions  
The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit reported in the Pension Benefits table is based on the following assumptions, which are consistent with those used for the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements on Ball Corporation's Form 10-K for fiscal year ending December 31, 2018:  Table of Contents

  OTHER POTENTIAL POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS         
This section provides information related to the potential post-employment benefits that could be payable or due to the NEOs under various termination scenarios. Such potential benefits payable or due may result from the Corporation's obligation to the executive under (1) any existing compensation and benefit plan, policy, practice or program of the Corporation that is generally available to all participants, or (2) under any agreement specifically entered into by the Corporation and the executive. 
In general, the compensation and benefit elements provided to employees, including the NEOs, are governed by provisions, terms or procedures of plan documents, policies and practices that define the rights of and the obligations due to the participant in the case of termination of employment. These provisions, terms or procedures apply to all employees, including the NEOs, receiving such compensation or benefit. Such compensation and benefit elements would include annual incentive compensation, long-term cash incentives, long-term equity incentives, retirement benefits and deferred compensation. 
The Corporation has entered into certain severance benefit and change-in-control agreements with the NEOs which contain provisions that require the Corporation to provide post-employment payments or benefits to each executive in the event of termination of employment without cause or termination following a change in control of the Corporation. The respective agreements with the NEOs contain customary noncompete provisions, non-solicitation provisions, non-disparagement provisions and confidentiality covenants, and were amended and restated in 2008 to conform to Code Section 409A. The Corporation does not have employment agreements with any of the NEOs. The key provisions, terms or procedures that would apply to the NEOs for the various compensation and benefit elements under various termination scenarios are summarized below. It is followed by another table containing an estimate of the compensation payable or the value of compensation elements due to the NEOs under the various termination scenarios assuming termination was effective at the end of the fiscal year 2018.  Table of Contents 
   Post-Employment Benefits Summary   Table of Contents Table of Contents
A termination without cause will be triggered if the NEO is terminated in either an Actual Termination not for cause or a Constructive Termination. An Actual Termination is any termination by the Corporation for reasons other than death or disability or for cause or by the executive for reasons other than Constructive Termination. A Constructive Termination means, in general terms, any significant reduction in duties, compensation or benefits or change of office location from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control, unless agreed to by the executive.  Table of Contents
Payments associated with a termination following a change in control will be triggered if both of the following two events occur: 
With respect to change-in-control agreements executed prior to 2010, in the event benefits are paid because of a change in control and such benefits are subject to Code Section 280G, the Corporation would reimburse the executive for such excise taxes paid, together with taxes incurred as a result of such reimbursement. Beginning in 2010, all newly executed change-in-control agreements do not include excise tax reimbursement. 
The table below represents the amounts potentially payable to the NEOs under various termination scenarios. The values assume termination on December 31, 2018, with stock awards and unexercisable stock options benefit values based on the Corporation's December 31, 2018, stock price of $45.98 and performance-based RSUs using a payout at target. Mr. Peterson is not included in this table as he terminated prior to the end of the fiscal year and received no severance or other special compensation treatment upon his termination from the Corporation, as disclosed in "Composition of our NEOs in 2018" and the "Summary Compensation Table."

  REPORT OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
The Committee has reviewed the above CD&A and discussed its contents with members of the Corporation's management. Based on this review and discussion, the Committee has recommended that this CD&A be incorporated by reference in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K and as set out in this Proxy Statement.

  CEO PAY RATIO         
The following ratio compares the total annual compensation of our median employee with the total annual compensation of Mr. Hayes, our CEO. The pay ratio included below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (the "pay ratio rule"). 
The total annual compensation of our median employee, not including our CEO, was $73,843. This total compensation amount includes salary paid in the fiscal year, bonuses, non-equity incentive plan compensation (even if paid in the following fiscal year), change in pension value, company contributions to defined contribution plans and other required compensation per Summary Compensation Table disclosure rules. The total annual compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $10,941,645. For 2018, the ratio of the total annual compensation of our CEO to the total annual compensation of our median employee was 148 to 1. 
For purposes of the above disclosure, we are required to identify our median employee based upon our total, global workforce. To identify our median-paid employee, from our total, global workforce, we used the following methodology, material assumptions, adjustments and estimates:
  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION         
The table set forth below summarizes the 2018 compensation paid to each of the Corporation's nonmanagement directors. The elements of the nonmanagement director compensation program are evaluated and determined by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, which takes into account market data provided by the Consultant. Effective January 1, 2018, the director compensation program consisted of a $85,000 annual fixed cash retainer, a $15,000 target annual incentive cash retainer, an annual RSU award valued at $145,000, annual committee chair cash retainers of $15,000 for Nominating/Corporate Governance and Finance Committees, and $20,000 for Human Resources and Audit Committees, and an annual fixed cash retainer of $25,000 for the lead independent director. The annual incentive retainer is subject to the Corporation's performance under the same performance measures as the Annual Consolidated EVA® Incentive Compensation Plan, which is based on EVA® principles. The actual amount paid may range from $0 to $30,000. Additionally, newly elected directors are each awarded a one-time grant of RSUs valued at $150,000 upon joining the Board. The elements of deferral for nonmanagement directors are detailed in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" section.  Table of Contents
The Director Compensation Table sets out the compensation earned for 2018, with any other compensation payments noted. The Corporation has established a stock ownership guideline for each nonmanagement director equal to five times their annual fixed retainer amount; all directors currently meet this guideline, with the exception of Ms. Ross and Mr. Bryant, who joined the Board in October 2017 and September 2018, respectively, and are in the process of attaining shares within the required period.

  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
The Audit Committee of the Corporation's Board consists of nonemployee directors who are independent under the NYSE Listing Standards and SEC rules. 
Management is responsible for the Corporation's (1) accounting policies; (2) system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting; (3) disclosure controls and procedures; (4) performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor; (5) Internal Audit Department; and (6) compliance with laws, regulations and applicable ethical business standards. The independent auditor is responsible for performing an audit of the Corporation's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and issuing a report thereon as well as issuing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee the internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and to engage and evaluate the independent auditor. Management has represented to the Committee that the financial statements for the Corporation for the year ended December 31, 2018, were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Committee has reviewed and discussed those financial statements with management and the independent auditor. The Committee has also discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by the Statement of Auditing Standards, as amended, the PCAOB Auditing Standards and the NYSE Listing Standards.  Table of Contents
The Corporation's independent auditor provided to the Committee on a quarterly basis the written disclosures and letter required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. The Committee has discussed with the independent auditor that firm's independence and that firm's internal quality control procedures, peer reviews and any investigations or inquiries by governmental or professional authorities disclosed by the independent auditor. 
Based upon the Committee's review and discussion with management and the independent auditor, the representations of management and the disclosures and letter of the independent auditor (as required by PCAOB Rule 3526), the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K, including managements and the independent auditor's opinion of the Corporation's effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, be filed with the SEC. 
The foregoing report has been furnished by the following members of the Audit Committee: 
Robert W. Alspaugh  John A. Bryant  Michael J. Cave  Daniel J. Heinrich  Cathy D. Ross 
  VOTING ITEM 2—RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR         
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been retained as the Corporation's external auditor continuously for many years. As disclosed in this Proxy Statement, during 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP rendered audit and non-audit services to the Corporation. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the independent external auditor is in the best interest of the Corporation and its investors. 
We are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if desired, as well as to respond to appropriate questions. 
To approve the selection of auditors, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, more votes must be cast "for" the proposal than are cast "against" it. For this vote, abstentions are considered neither votes "for" nor "against" and will not affect the outcome of the vote. 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
In the event shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different registered independent public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Corporation and our shareholders. 
  VOTING ITEM 3—ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION         
We are asking our shareholders to provide advisory approval of the compensation of our NEOs, as we have described it in the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement. We are seeking this approval pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. While this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Corporation, it  Table of Contents will provide useful information to our management and our Human Resources Committee regarding our shareholders' views about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the Committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the balance of 2019 and beyond. Following is a summary of some of the key points of our 2018 executive compensation program. Please see the "Executive Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section for more information. 
Our executive compensation program has been designed to implement certain core compensation principles, including alignment of management's interests with our shareholders' interests to support long-term value creation and pay-for-performance. In the course of establishing the 2018 compensation program and awarding compensation, our management and our Human Resources Committee determined the use of performance-based incentives to motivate our NEOs to achieve current and long-term business goals, after reviewing data and analyses regarding comparable market compensation. Management and the Committee received advice and counsel on the program from an independent consultant, which provided no other services to the Corporation other than those provided directly to or on behalf of the Committee. 
At the April 2018 annual meeting, shareholders were asked to approve the Corporation's fiscal 2017 executive compensation programs. Of those votes included in the tabulation, 68.7% voted to approve the proposal. In light of these results, and in consideration of shareholder input obtained from outreach efforts taken specifically in connection with the 2018 meeting and Say-on-Pay voting results, the Human Resources Committee carefully reviewed the Corporation's executive compensation practices. The Human Resources Committee concluded that the Corporation's existing executive compensation program continues to be the most appropriate for the Corporation and effective in rewarding executives commensurate with business results.  Table of Contents
  Summary of 2018 Named Executive Officer Compensation         
Our NEOs' 2018 compensation consisted primarily of the following components which includes base salary, annual EVA® incentive plan awards, LTCIP and awarded value of stock options and PC-RSUs (in addition to the retirement, health and welfare plans and programs in which all of our full-time employees participate, as well as limited perquisites). 
We believe our 2018 executive compensation program reflects best practices and was designed to balance risk and reward. We focus on pay-for-performance in establishing our executive compensation program and setting the plans' performance metrics. With input from an independent consultant, our Human Resources Committee continued to apply competitive benchmarking (pay and performance) in 2018 relative to the unique structure and needs of the Corporation. Our program seeks to mitigate risks related to compensation and align management's interests with shareholders' interests in long-term value creation. 
 Vote requested.    We believe the information we have provided above and within the "Executive Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement demonstrates that our executive compensation program in respect of our NEOs was designed appropriately and is working to ensure that management's interests are aligned with our shareholders' interests to support long-term value creation. Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that shareholders approve the program by approving the following advisory resolution, the results of which will be counted  Table of Contents and considered by the Board. For this vote, abstentions and broker nonvotes are considered neither votes "for" nor "against" and will not affect the outcome of the vote. 
RESOLVED: That the shareholders of Ball Corporation hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the individuals identified in the "Summary Compensation Table," as disclosed in the Ball Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K which disclosure includes the "Executive Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, the compensation tables and the accompanying footnotes and narratives within the "Executive Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of such Proxy Statement. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote Approving Executive Officer Compensation.
  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING         
To be eligible for inclusion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, proposals of shareholders must be in writing and be received by the Corporate Secretary at the Corporation's principal executive offices, 10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021-2510, by November 13, 2019. 
If a shareholder desires to bring business before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is not the subject of a proposal submitted for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, the shareholder must notify the Corporation of the shareholder's proposal, which must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation between December 26, 2019, and January 25, 2020, or the proposal may be considered untimely. The appointed proxies may exercise their discretionary authority to vote previously solicited proxies against such proposal if it is raised at the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE         
To our knowledge, based solely upon a review of the copies of the forms furnished to the Corporation, and/or written representations from certain reporting persons, the Corporation believes that all filing requirements under Section 16(a) applicable to its officers and directors were met during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except, as the result of an administrative error, Mr. Fisher's grant of DSP RSUs on April 13, 2018, was not timely reported and was corrected by a Form 4 Amendment filed on August 20, 2018. 
  HOUSEHOLDING         
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for Proxy Statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Proxy Statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. This could be applicable to you if you request a paper copy of these proxy materials after you receive notice of Internet access to the proxy materials. 
A number of brokers with account holders who are shareholders may be householding our proxy materials, to the extent such shareholders have given their prior express or implied consent in accordance with SEC rules. A single Proxy Statement and Annual Report will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent, which is deemed to be given unless you inform the broker otherwise when you receive the original notice of householding. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement and Annual Report, please notify your broker to discontinue householding and direct your written request to receive a separate Proxy Statement and Annual Report to the Corporation at: Ball Corporation, Attention: Investor Relations, 10 Longs Peak Drive, Broomfield, Colorado 80021 or call Investor Relations at 303-460-3537. Shareholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their broker.  Table of Contents
  SOLICITATION AND OTHER MATTERS         
The Corporation will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Georgeson Inc. has been retained to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $8,000. In addition to solicitations by mail, proxies also may be solicited personally, or by telephone or electronic means by some directors, officers and regular employees of the Corporation, without additional compensation, as well as by employees of Georgeson Inc. The Corporation will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy material, Annual Report and other shareholder materials to the beneficial owners of common stock where those owners request such materials. 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of the Corporation has no knowledge of any matters to be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to above. However, the persons named in the accompanying proxy shall have authority to vote such proxy as to any other matters that properly come before the meeting and as to matters incidental to the conduct of the meeting, according to their discretion.

   Section C. Director Resignation Policy.  
        In an uncontested election of directors of the corporation, any nominee who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election will, within ten (10) days following the certification of the shareholder vote, tender his or her written resignation to the chairman of the board for consideration by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee (the "Committee"). As used in this Section C, an "uncontested election of directors of the corporation" is an election in which the only nominees are persons nominated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 
        The Committee will consider such tendered resignation and, within sixty (60) days following the certification of the shareholder vote, will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors concerning the acceptance or rejection of such resignation. In determining its recommendation to the Board, the Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Committee. 
        The Committee also will consider a range of possible alternatives concerning the director's tendered resignation as the members of the Committee deem appropriate, including, without limitation, acceptance of the resignation, rejection of the resignation or rejection of the resignation coupled with a commitment to seek to address and cure the underlying reasons reasonably believed by the Committee to have substantially resulted in the "withheld" votes. 
        The Board of Directors of the Corporation will take formal action on the Committee's recommendation no later than ninety-five (95) days following the certification of the shareholder vote. In considering the Committee's recommendation, the Board will consider the information, factors and alternatives considered by the Committee and such additional information, factors and alternatives as the Board deems relevant. 
        Following the Board's decision on the Committee's recommendation, the corporation, within four (4) business days after such decision is made, will publicly disclose, in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Board's decision, together with an explanation of the process by which the decision was made and, if applicable, the Board's reason or reasons for its decision. 
        No director who, in accordance with this Section C, is required to tender his or her resignation, shall participate in the Committee's deliberations or recommendation, or in the Board's deliberations or determination, with respect to accepting or rejecting his or her resignation as a director. If a majority of the members of the Committee received a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election than votes "for" their election, then the independent directors then serving on the Board of Directors who received a greater number of votes "for" their election than votes "withheld" from their election, and the directors, if any, who were not standing for election, will appoint an ad hoc Board Committee from among themselves (the "Ad Hoc Committee"), consisting of such number of directors as they may determine to be appropriate, solely for the purpose of considering and making a recommendation to the Board with respect to the tendered resignations. The Ad Hoc Committee shall serve in place of the Committee and perform the Committee's duties for purposes of this Section C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Ad Hoc Committee would have been created but fewer than three directors would be eligible to serve on it, the entire Board of Directors (other than the director whose resignation is being considered) will make the determination to accept or reject the tendered resignation without any recommendation from the Committee and without the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee.
