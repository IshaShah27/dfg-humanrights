Information About Our Annual Meeting
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Kimberly-Clark Corporation, we are soliciting your proxy for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to be held on May 2, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. at our World Headquarters, which is located at 351 Phelps Drive, Irving, Texas.
We began providing our proxy statement and form of proxy to stockholders on March 8, 2019.
As Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules permit, we are making our proxy statement and our annual report available to many of our stockholders via the Internet rather than by mail. This reduces printing and delivery costs and supports our sustainability efforts. You may have received in the mail a "Notice of Electronic Availability" explaining how to access this proxy statement and our annual report on the Internet and how to vote online. If you received this Notice but would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions contained in the notice for requesting these materials.
If you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on the record date of March 4, 2019, you are eligible to vote at the meeting. Each share that you own entitles you to one vote. 
As of the record date, 344,109,382 shares of our common stock were outstanding.
You may vote in person by attending the meeting, by using the Internet or telephone, or (if you received printed proxy materials) by completing and returning a proxy form by mail. If telephone or Internet voting is available to you, see the instructions on the notice of electronic availability or the proxy form and have the notice or proxy form available when you access the Internet website or place your telephone call. To vote your proxy by mail, mark your vote on the proxy form, then follow the instructions on the card. 
Please note that if you received a notice of electronic availability as described above, you cannot vote your shares by filling out and returning the notice. Instead, you should follow the instructions contained in the notice on how to vote by using the Internet or telephone. 
The named proxies will vote your shares according to your directions. The voting results will be certified by independent Inspectors of Election.
Table of Contents
If you sign and return your proxy form, or if you vote using the Internet or by telephone, but you do not specify how you want to vote your shares, the named proxies will vote your shares as follows: 
There are several ways to revoke or change your vote:
There must be a quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting, which is established by having a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy.
Election of Directors. A director nominee will be elected if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in person or by proxy. If any nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast, then that nominee will be subject to the Board's policy regarding resignations by directors who do not receive a majority of "for" votes.
Other Proposals or Matters. Approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares that are present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and are entitled to vote on the proposal or matter.
Election of Directors. Abstentions will have no impact on the outcome of the vote. They will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast or as votes "for" or "against" a nominee.
Other Proposals. Abstentions will be counted:
Table of Contents
Routine Matters. If your shares are held through a broker and you do not instruct the broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may choose to leave your shares unvoted or to vote your shares on routine matters. "Proposal 2. Ratification of Auditor" is the only routine matter on the agenda at this year's Annual Meeting. 
Non-Routine Matters. Without instructions, your broker cannot vote your shares on non-routine matters, resulting in what are known as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will not be considered present or entitled to vote on non-routine matters and will also not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast on these proposals.
If you participate in our Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, you will receive a proxy form that represents the number of full shares in your plan account plus any other shares registered in your name. There are no special instructions for voting shares held in the plan; simply use the normal voting methods described in this proxy statement.
We are also sending or otherwise making this proxy statement and voting materials available to participants who hold Kimberly-Clark stock through any of our employee benefit and stock purchase plans. The trustee of each plan will vote whole shares of stock attributable to each participant's interest in the plans in accordance with the participant's directions. If a participant gives no directions, the plan committee will direct the voting of his or her shares.
If you are eligible to vote, you or a duly appointed representative may attend the Annual Meeting in person. If you do plan to attend, we ask that you inform us electronically, by telephone, or by checking the appropriate box on your proxy form. This will assist us with meeting preparations and help to expedite your admittance. 
If your shares are not registered in your own name and you would like to attend the meeting, please ask the broker, trust, bank or other nominee that holds your shares to provide you with written proof of your share ownership as of the record date. This will enable you to gain admission to the meeting. 
If you need directions to the meeting, please contact Stockholder Services by telephone at (972) 281-5317 or by e-mail at stockholders@kcc.com.
Kimberly-Clark will bear all costs of this proxy solicitation, including the cost of preparing, printing and delivering materials, the cost of the proxy solicitation and the expenses of brokers, fiduciaries and other nominees who forward proxy materials to stockholders. In addition to mail and electronic means, our employees may solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise. We have retained D. F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation at a cost of approximately $20,000 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.
Table of Contents
Corporate Governance
Our governance structure and processes are based on a number of important governance documents including our Code of Conduct, Certificate of Incorporation, Corporate By-Laws, Corporate Governance Policies and our Board Committee Charters. These documents, which are available in the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com, guide the Board and our management in the execution of their responsibilities. 
Kimberly-Clark believes that there is a direct connection between good corporate governance and long-term, sustained business success, and we believe it is important to uphold sound governance practices. As such, the Board reviews its governance practices and documents on an ongoing basis, considering changing regulatory requirements, governance trends and issues raised by our stockholders. After careful evaluation, we may periodically make changes to maintain or enhance current governance practices and promote stockholder value.
The Board has established a leadership structure that allocates responsibilities between our Executive Chairman of the Board and our Independent Lead Director. The Board believes that this allocation provides for dynamic Board leadership while maintaining strong independence and oversight. 
Mr. Falk, our Chief Executive Officer until January 2019, served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since 2003, and has been a member of our Board since 1999. In January 2019, Mr. Hsu became Chief Executive Officer, with Mr. Falk continuing to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. 
Consistent with our Board leadership structure, at least once a quarter our Lead Director, who is an independent director, chairs executive sessions of our non-management directors. Members of our senior management team do not attend these sessions. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Positions The Board's view is that our current leadership structure, with separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions, coupled with a predominantly independent board and a proactive, independent Lead Director, is appropriate at this time in ensuring leadership continuity at the Board level throughout our CEO transition period. Mr. Falk, as Executive Chairman, remains involved in long-term strategic planning and other key matters, and continues to advise Mr. Hsu. The Board believes Mr. Falk's thirty-five years of operational and management experience at Kimberly-Clark has demonstrated the leadership and vision necessary to lead the Board. As Mr. Falk is not an independent director, the Board continues to believe it is appropriate for the independent directors to elect an Independent Lead Director. 
Lead Director  Mr. Read has served as Independent Lead Director since 2017. Our Corporate Governance Policies outline the significant role and responsibilities of the Lead Director, which include: 
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Coordinating the activities of the Independent Directors 
►  Providing input on and approving the agendas and schedules for Board meetings 
►  Leading (with the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) the annual Board evaluation 
►  Leading (with the Chairman of the Management Development and Compensation Committee) the Board's review and discussion of the Chief Executive Officer's performance 
►  Providing feedback to individual directors following their individual evaluations 
►  Speaking on behalf of the Board and chairing Board meetings when the Executive Chairman of the Board is unable to do so 
►  Acting as a direct conduit to the Board for stockholders, employees and others according to the Board's policies 
[END TABLE]
Our By-Laws provide that a majority of our directors must be independent ("Independent Directors"). We believe our independent board helps ensure good corporate governance and strong internal controls.
Our Corporate Governance Policies, as adopted by the Board, provide independence standards consistent with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Our independence standards can be found in Section 7 of our Corporate Governance Policies.
The Board has determined that all directors and nominees, except for Thomas J. Falk and Michael D. Hsu, are Independent Directors and meet the independence standards in our Corporate Governance Policies. In making these determinations, the Board considered the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Companies majority-owned by Mr. Bergstrom paid us approximately $57,000 in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to lease excess hangar space at an airport near Appleton, Wisconsin, and approximately $326,000 in 2016, $240,000 in  2017 and $240,000 in 2018 for pilot services pursuant to a pilot sharing contract. In addition, these companies paid us approximately $204,000 in 2016, $198,000 in 2017 and $197,000 in 2018 for scheduling and aircraft services for their  airplane. 
►  We paid approximately $5,000 in 2016, $11,000 in 2017 and $6,000 in 2018 for automobiles and related services to car dealerships in the Neenah, Wisconsin area that are majority-owned by Mr.  Bergstrom. 
[END TABLE]
The NYSE listing standards and our own Corporate Governance Policies establish certain levels at which transactions are considered to have the potential to affect a director's independence. The transactions listed above all fall below these levels. Under our Corporate Governance Policies, certain relationships were considered immaterial and therefore were not considered by the Board in determining independence.
The Board of Directors met seven times in 2018. All of the directors attended in excess of 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served.
All of our directors are encouraged to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. All of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
Table of Contents
The standing committees of the Board include the Audit Committee, Management Development and Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and Executive Committee. In compliance with applicable NYSE corporate governance listing standards, the Board has adopted charters for all Committees except the Executive Committee.
Our Committee charters are available in the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com.
As set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, the Audit, Management Development and Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees all have the authority to retain independent advisors and consultants, with all costs paid by Kimberly-Clark.
Audit Committee
The Board has determined that each Audit Committee member is an "audit committee financial expert" under SEC rules and regulations and that Mr. Maclin and Ms. Shive, who are director nominees but not current directors, also qualify as audit committee financial experts. In addition, all Audit Committee members satisfy the NYSE's financial literacy requirements and qualify as Independent Directors under the rules of the SEC and the NYSE, as well as under our Corporate Governance Policies. See "Corporate Governance - Director Independence" for additional information on Independent Directors.
No member of the Audit Committee serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies and under our Audit Committee Charter, no Committee member is permitted to do so.
During 2018 the Committee met nine times.
The Committee's principal functions, as specified in its charter, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Overseeing: 
➢  the quality and integrity of our financial statements 
➢  our compliance programs 
➢  the independence, qualification and performance of our independent auditor 
➢  the performance of our internal auditor 
►  Selecting and engaging our independent auditor, subject to stockholder ratification 
►  Pre-approving all audit and non-audit services that our independent auditor provides 
►  Reviewing the scope of audits and audit findings, including any comments or recommendations of our independent auditor 
►  Establishing policies for our internal audit programs 
►  Overseeing the company's risk management program (including risks related to data privacy and cybersecurity) and receiving periodic reports from management on risk assessments, the risk management process,  and issues related to the risks of managing our business 
[END TABLE]

Table of Contents
Management Development and Compensation Committee
Each member of this Committee is an Independent Director under the rules of the SEC and the NYSE, as well as under our Corporate Governance Policies. The Committee met four times in 2018.
The Committee's principal functions, as specified in its charter, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Establishing and administering the policies governing annual compensation and long-term compensation, including stock option awards, restricted stock awards and restricted share unit awards, such that the policies  are designed to align compensation with our overall business strategy and performance 
►  Setting, after an evaluation of his overall performance, the compensation level of the Chief Executive Officer 
►  Approving, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, compensation levels and performance targets for the senior executive team 
►  Overseeing: 
➢  leadership development for senior management and future senior management candidates 
➢  a periodic review of our long-term and emergency succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other key officer positions, in conjunction with our Board 
➢  key organizational effectiveness and engagement policies 
►  Reviewing diversity and inclusion programs and related metrics 
►  Annually reviewing our compensation policies and practices for the purpose of mitigating risks arising from these policies and practices that could reasonably have a material adverse  effect 
[END TABLE]
Roles of the Committee and the CEO and COO in Compensation Decisions Each year, the Committee reviews and sets the compensation of the officers that are elected by the Board (our "elected officers"), including our Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Chairman and our other executive officers. The Committee's charter does not permit the Committee to delegate to anyone the authority to establish any compensation policies or programs for elected officers, including our executive officers. With respect to officers that have been appointed to their position (our "non-elected officers"), our Chief Executive Officer has the authority to establish compensation programs and to approve equity grants. However, only the Committee may make grants to elected officers, including our executive officers.
Our Chief Executive Officer makes a recommendation to the Committee each year on the appropriate target annual compensation for each of the other executive officers (other than the Executive Chairman). In 2018, when Mr. Falk served as Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Hsu was Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Falk and Mr. Hsu each made recommendations to the Committee for the executive officers who were their respective direct reports. The Committee makes the final determination of the target annual compensation for each executive officer. While our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer (in 2018), Executive Chairman (in 2019) and Chief Human Resources Officer typically attend Committee meetings, none of the other executive officers is present during the portion of the Committee's meetings when compensation for executive officers is set. In addition, none of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer (in 2018) or Executive Chairman (in 2019) is present during the portion of the Committee's meetings when his compensation is set.
Table of Contents
For additional information on the Committee's processes and procedures for determining executive compensation, and for a detailed discussion of our compensation policies, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Use of Compensation Consultants The Committee's charter authorizes it to retain advisors, including compensation consultants, to assist it in its work. The Committee believes that compensation consultants can provide important market information and perspectives that can help it determine compensation programs that best meet the objectives of our compensation policies. In selecting a consultant, the Committee evaluates the independence of the firm as a whole and of the individual advisors who will be working with the Committee.
Independent Committee Consultant. In 2018, the Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group as its independent executive compensation consultant. According to the Committee's written policy, the independent Committee consultant provides services solely to the Committee and not to Kimberly-Clark. Semler Brossy has no other business relationship with Kimberly-Clark and receives no payments from us other than fees for services to the Committee. Semler Brossy reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee may replace it or hire additional consultants at any time. A representative of Semler Brossy attends Committee meetings and communicates with the Chairman of the Committee between meetings from time to time.
The scope of Semler Brossy's engagement in 2018 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Conducting a review of the competitive market data (including base salary, annual incentive targets and long-term incentive targets) for our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Executive  Chairman 
►  Reviewing and commenting, as requested by the Committee, on recommendations by management and Mercer Human Resource Consulting ("Mercer") concerning executive compensation programs, including program  changes and redesign, special awards, change-of-control provisions, our executive compensation peer group, any executive contract provisions, promotions, retirement and related items 
►  Reviewing and commenting on the Committee's report for the proxy statement 
►  Attending Committee meetings 
►  Periodically consulting with the Chairman of the Committee 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, at the request of the Committee, a representative of Semler Brossy attended all Committee meetings.
Kimberly-Clark Consultant. To assist management and the Committee in assessing our compensation programs and determining appropriate, competitive compensation for our executive officers, Kimberly-Clark annually engages an outside compensation consultant. In 2018, it retained Mercer for this purpose. Mercer has provided consulting services to Kimberly-Clark on a wide variety of human resources and compensation matters, both at the officer and non-officer levels. During 2018, Mercer provided advice and counsel on various matters relating to executive and director remuneration, including the following services:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Assessing our executive compensation peer group and recommending changes as necessary 
►  Assessing compensation levels within our peer group for executive officer positions and other selected positions 
►  Reviewing historic and projected performance for peer group companies under the metrics we use in our annual and long-term incentive plans 
►  Assisting in incentive plan design and modifications, as requested 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Providing market research on various issues as requested by management 
►  Preparing for and participating in Committee meetings, as requested 
►  Reviewing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy statement and other disclosures, as requested 
►  Consulting with management on compensation matters 
[END TABLE]
Committee Assessment of Consultant Conflicts of Interest. The Committee has reviewed whether the work provided by Semler Brossy and Mercer represents any conflict of interest. Factors considered by the Committee include: (1) other services provided to Kimberly-Clark by the consultant; (2) what percentage of the consultant's total revenue is made up of fees from Kimberly-Clark; (3) policies or procedures of the consultant that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between individual consultants involved in the engagement and Committee members; (5) any shares of Kimberly-Clark stock owned by individual consultants involved in the engagement; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. Based on its review, the Committee does not believe that any of the compensation consultants that performed services in 2018 has a conflict of interest with respect to the work performed for Kimberly-Clark or the Committee.
Committee Report The Committee has reviewed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement and has recommended that it be included in this proxy statement. The Committee's report is located at "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Management Development and Compensation Committee Report."
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Each member of this Committee is an Independent Director under the rules of the SEC and the NYSE, as well as under our Corporate Governance Policies. The Committee met four times in 2018.
The Committee's principal functions, as specified in its charter, include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Maintaining and reviewing a Board succession plan 
►  Overseeing the process for Board nominations 
►  Advising the Board on: 
➢  Board organization, membership, function, performance and compensation 
➢  committee structure and membership 
➢  policies and positions regarding significant stockholder relations issues 
►  Overseeing corporate governance matters, including developing and recommending to the Board changes to our Corporate Governance Policies 
►  Reviewing director independence standards and making recommendations to the Board with respect to the determination of director independence 
►  Monitoring and recommending improvements to the Board's practices and procedures 
►  Reviewing stockholder proposals and considering how to respond to them

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
The Committee, in accordance with its charter and our Certificate of Incorporation, has established criteria and processes for director nominations, including those proposed by stockholders. Those criteria and processes are described in "Proposal 1. Election of Directors - Process and Criteria for Nominating Directors," "Other Information - Stockholder Director Nominees for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement" and "Other Information - Stockholder Director Nominees Not Included in Next Year's Proxy Statement."
Executive Committee
The Committee met two times in 2018.
The Committee's principal function is to exercise, when necessary between Board meetings, the Board's powers to direct our business and affairs.
None of the members of the Management Development and Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of Kimberly-Clark. No interlocking relationship exists between the members of our Board of Directors or the Management Development and Compensation Committee and the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company.
Proxy Access By-Law. Eligible stockholders may nominate candidates for election to the Board under our "proxy access" By-Law. Proxy access candidates will be included in our proxy materials. The proxy access By-Law permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning three percent or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials directors constituting up to two individuals or 20 percent of the Board (whichever is greater).
Stockholders who wish to nominate directors under our proxy access By-Law should follow the instructions under "Other Information - Stockholder Director Nominees for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement."
Special Stockholder Meetings. Our Certificate of Incorporation allows the holders of 25 percent or more of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock to request that a special meeting of stockholders be called, subject to procedures and other requirements set forth in our By-Laws.
Board Policy on Stockholder Rights Plans. We do not have a "poison pill" or stockholder rights plan. If we were to adopt a stockholder rights plan, the Board would seek prior stockholder approval of the plan unless, due to timing constraints or other reasons, a majority of Independent Directors of the Board determines that it would be in the best interests of stockholders to adopt a plan before obtaining stockholder approval. If a stockholder rights plan is adopted without prior stockholder approval, the plan must either be ratified by stockholders or must expire, without being renewed or replaced, within one year. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews this policy statement periodically and reports to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy.
Simple Majority Voting Provisions. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not include supermajority voting provisions.
Table of Contents
The Board has established a process by which stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board, including the Lead Director. That process can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com.
Under our stockholder engagement policy, set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, stockholders who wish to meet directly with members of our Board may send a meeting request to our Lead Director who will consider the request in consultation with the Corporate Secretary. Requests should include information about the requesting party (including the number of shares held), the reason for requesting the meeting and the topics to be discussed.
Each year we meet with investors on corporate governance matters, including executive compensation, board composition and refreshment and corporate social responsibility and sustainability. This process ensures that management and the Board understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders and enables the company to address them effectively. During 2018, we offered meetings to stockholders representing more than 50 percent of our common stock and held numerous discussions. Our executive compensation programs and corporate governance profile reflect the input of stockholders from our outreach efforts.
At Kimberly-Clark, everything we do is motivated by our vision to lead the world in essentials for a better life. This vision inspires our efforts to make lives better with the products that we sell and the programs that we implement.
Our Board has established and approved the framework for our sustainability-related policies and procedures, including environmental stewardship, energy and climate, fiber sourcing, product safety, charitable contributions, human rights, labor, and diversity and inclusion in employment. As part of their oversight roles, the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receive regular reports from management on these topics, and our goals and our progress toward achieving them.
In 2016, we launched our Sustainability 2022 program, building on the strong foundation and lessons learned from our previous multi-year sustainability programs. Sustainability 2022 is designed with an emphasis on creating long-term business value while generating positive social and environmental impact.
The program establishes specific goals to be achieved by the company's 150th anniversary in 2022 in five priority areas: social impact, forests and fiber, waste and recycling, energy and climate and supply chain. These priorities reflect our assessment of sustainability-related risks and opportunities and also inform our public disclosure of sustainability performance.
Our management of these focus areas includes processes and systems to mitigate risks and enable compliance with legal requirements and Kimberly-Clark standards. This has enabled continued good progress as we began to tackle the challenges associated with these goals. We are also realizing business benefits such as cost savings associated with energy efficiency improvements and alternative energy deployment, growth through support of social and environmental causes relevant to our brands and supply chain resiliency through management of risks related to water security and deforestation.

Corporate Governance Policies. The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Policies which guide Kimberly-Clark and the Board on matters of corporate governance, including: director responsibilities, Board committees and their charters, director independence, director compensation, performance assessments of the Board and individual directors, Board succession planning, confidentiality and conflicts of interest, director orientation and education, director access to management, Board access to outside financial, business and legal advisors, management development and succession planning, and Board interaction with stockholders. The Board monitors emerging issues and amends these policies from time to time as rules and regulations change and governance practices develop. To see the policies, go to the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com.
Board and Committee Evaluations. The Board conducts annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively and whether its governing documents continue to remain appropriate. Each Board member is periodically evaluated on an individual basis. The process is designed and overseen by our Lead Director and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the results of the evaluations are discussed by the full Board.
Each committee annually reviews its own performance and assesses the adequacy of its charter, and reports the results and any recommendations to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees and reports annually to the Board its assessment of each committee's performance evaluation process.
Board Succession Planning. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee maintains and reviews a succession plan for the Board, as described in "Proposal 1. Election of Directors -Process and Criteria for Nominating Directors."

Board and Management Roles in Risk Oversight. The Board is responsible for providing risk oversight with respect to our operations. In connection with this oversight, the Board particularly focuses on our strategic and operational risks, as well as related risk mitigation. In addition, the Board reviews and oversees management's response to key risks facing Kimberly-Clark.
The Board's committees review particular risk areas to assist the Board in its overall risk oversight of Kimberly-Clark:
Complementing the Board's overall risk oversight, our senior executive team identifies and monitors key enterprise-wide and business unit risks, providing the basis for the Board's risk review and oversight process. We have a Global Risk Oversight Committee, consisting of management members from core business units and from our finance, treasury, global risk management, legal, internal audit, human resources and supply chain functions. This committee identifies significant risks for review and updates our policies for risk management in areas such as hedging, foreign currency and country risks, product liability, property and casualty risks, data privacy and cybersecurity risks, and supplier and customer risks. The Board believes the allocation of risk management responsibilities described above supplements the Board's leadership structure by allocating risk areas to an appropriate committee for oversight, allows for an orderly escalation of issues as necessary, and helps the Board satisfy its risk oversight responsibilities.
Whistleblower Procedures. The Audit Committee has established procedures for receiving, recording and addressing any complaints we receive regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and for the confidential and anonymous submission, by our employees or others, of any concerns about our accounting or auditing practices. We also maintain a toll-free Code of Conduct telephone helpline and a website, each allowing our employees and others to voice their concerns anonymously.
Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Our Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees our compliance programs. His duties include: regularly updating the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of our compliance programs, providing periodic reports to the Board, and working closely with our various compliance functions to promote coordination and sharing of best practices across these functions.

Management Succession Planning. In conjunction with the Board, the Management Development and Compensation Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the long-term management development plans and succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and other key officers, as well as the emergency succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer and other key officers if any of these officers unexpectedly becomes unable to perform his or her duties.
Disclosure Committee. We have established a Disclosure Committee to assist in fulfilling our obligations to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and to coordinate and oversee the process of preparing our periodic securities filings with the SEC. This committee is composed of members of management and is chaired by our Vice President and Controller.
No Executive Loans. We do not extend loans to our executive officers or directors, and, therefore, do not have any such loans outstanding.
Charitable Contributions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted guidelines for the review and approval of charitable contributions by Kimberly-Clark (or any foundation under the common control of Kimberly-Clark) to organizations or entities with which a director or an executive officer may be affiliated. We will disclose in the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com any contributions made by us to a tax-exempt organization under the following circumstances:

Proposal 1. Election of Directors
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors consists of fourteen members. Each director's term will expire at this year's Annual Meeting.
John F. Bergstrom and James M. Jenness will not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors when their terms expire at this year's Annual Meeting. Mr. Bergstrom and Mr. Jenness will continue to serve as directors until the Annual Meeting. We would like to thank Mr. Bergstrom and Mr. Jenness for their many years of service and substantial contributions to the Board, Kimberly-Clark and our stockholders.
All of the nominees are currently serving as directors except for S. Todd Maclin and Dunia A. Shive, who were nominated for election to the Board on February 6, 2019.
All the nominees standing for election at the Annual Meeting are being nominated to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. All nominees have advised us that they will serve if elected; however, should any nominee become unable to serve, proxies may be voted for another person designated by the Board.
Given the independent status of the nominees, if all nominees are elected at the Annual Meeting, twelve of the fourteen directors on our Board will be Independent Directors.
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that all of our directors must be elected annually. Our By-Laws provide that, in uncontested elections, directors must be elected by a majority of votes cast rather than by a plurality. If any incumbent director does not receive a majority of votes, he or she is required to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Board.
The Board of Directors is responsible for approving candidates for Board membership. The Board has adopted a Board succession planning policy which formalizes its commitment to refreshing and maintaining a group of directors with diverse perspectives and capabilities. The Board believes that adding fresh perspectives is critical, but also values the institutional knowledge and experience of long-serving directors. The Board is committed to balancing these factors through our succession plan, retirement policy and director evaluation process.
Under our succession planning policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee maintains and reviews a Board succession plan, taking into account current composition and qualifications, Kimberly-Clark's current and expected needs, director tenure, the effectiveness of the Board and any planned or unplanned vacancies. In consultation with the Executive Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director, the Committee screens and recruits director candidates and recommends to the Board any new appointments and nominees for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. It also recommends nominees to fill any vacancies. As provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the size of the Board and to fill any vacancies that occur between annual meetings of stockholders.

The Committee may receive recommendations for Board candidates from various sources, including our directors, management and stockholders. This year, each of Mr. Maclin, Ms. McCoy and Ms. Shive was recommended for nomination by an Independent Director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically retains a search firm to assist it in identifying and recruiting director candidates meeting the criteria specified by the Committee. In addition, as described in "Corporate Governance - Stockholder Rights," our By-Laws provide for proxy access stockholder nominations of director candidates. Stockholders who wish to nominate directors under our proxy access By-Law should follow the instructions under "Other Information - Stockholder Director Nominees for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement." Stockholders who wish to nominate directors who are not intended to be included in the company's proxy materials should follow the instructions under "Other Information - Stockholder Director Nominees Not Included in Next Year's Proxy Statement."
The Committee believes that the criteria for director nominees should foster effective corporate governance, support our strategies and businesses and ensure that our directors, as a group, both have an overall mix of the attributes needed for an effective Board and reflect diversity of background and viewpoint. The criteria should also support the successful recruitment of qualified candidates.
Qualified candidates for director are those who, in the judgment of the Committee, possess a sufficient mix of the experience attributes listed below to ensure effective service on the Board. In addition, all nominees must possess high standards for ethical behavior, good interpersonal skills and a proactive and solution-oriented leadership style.
EXPERIENCE ATTRIBUTES
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the background of each of our director nominees in light of the experience attributes described above. The Committee has determined that each nominee possesses a sufficient mix of the experience attributes and that the nominees collectively possess the necessary experience to effectively guide our company.
For details about each nominee's specific experience attributes, see "The Nominees" below.
As noted above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute to include in the boardroom. As a result, the Committee seeks to have a diverse Board that is representative of our customer, consumer, employee and stockholder base. While the Committee carefully considers this diversity when identifiying potential director candidates, the Committee has not established a formal policy regarding diversity. Our Board currently includes individuals of differing ages, races and genders.

Directors who are not officers or employees of Kimberly-Clark or any of our subsidiaries, affiliates or equity companies are "Outside Directors" for compensation purposes and are compensated for their services under our 2011 Outside Directors' Compensation Plan. All Independent Directors currently on our Board are Outside Directors and are compensated under this Plan.
Our objectives for Outside Director Compensation are:
In 2016, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assessed our Outside Director compensation against the median non-management director compensation for our peers. Based on this review, the Committee recommended an increase in Outside Director compensation for 2017, and the Board agreed with the Committee's recommendation. For 2018 there was no change.
The table below shows how we structured Outside Director compensation in 2018:
New Outside Directors receive the full quarterly amount of the annual retainer for the quarter in which they join the Board. Their annual grant of restricted share units is pro-rated based on the date when they joined.
We also reimburse Outside Directors for expenses incurred in attending Board or committee meetings.
Restricted share units are not shares of our common stock. Rather, restricted share units represent the right to receive a pre-determined number of shares of our common stock within 90 days following a "restricted period" that begins on the date of grant and expires on the date the Outside Director retires from or otherwise terminates service on the Board. In this way, they align the director's interests with the interests of our stockholders. Outside Directors may not dispose of the units or use them in a pledge or similar transaction. Outside Directors also receive additional restricted share units equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid to them if the restricted share units granted to them were shares of our common stock.

 2018 Outside Director  Compensation 
[END TABLE]
The following table shows the compensation paid to each Outside Director for his or her service in 2018.
Table of Contents
Other than the cash retainer, grants of restricted share units and the other compensation previously described, no Outside Director received any compensation or perquisites from Kimberly-Clark for services as a director in 2018.
A director who is not an Outside Director does not receive any compensation for services as a member of the Board or any committee, but is reimbursed for expenses incurred as a result of the services.
In 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the assistance of Mercer, revisited the Corporation's Outside Director compensation to assess whether it still met our objectives for Outside Director compensation as described above. In its assessment, the Committee compared aggregate Outside Director cash and equity compensation to the median compensation of the outside directors of our peer group, as well as the structure of our compensation programs of our peer group. For information regarding our peer group, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below. Based on this review, the Committee determined not to make any changes to our Outside Director Compensation Program for 2019.

Proposal 2. Ratification of Auditor
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent auditor. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing the negotiation of the audit fees associated with retaining our independent auditor. To assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether a different audit firm should perform our independent audit work. Also, in connection with the mandated rotation of the independent auditor's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairman are directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner.
For 2019, the Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP (along with its member firms and affiliates, "Deloitte") as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements. In engaging Deloitte for 2019, the Audit Committee utilized a review and selection process that included the following:
The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Deloitte to serve as our independent auditor is in the best interests of Kimberly-Clark and its stockholders, and they recommend that stockholders ratify this selection. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Deloitte, the Audit Committee will consider the selection of another independent auditor.
Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Table of Contents
Our aggregate fees to Deloitte (excluding value added taxes) with respect to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows (dollars in millions):
Using the following procedures, the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by Deloitte to Kimberly-Clark:
The Audit Committee reviews the requests presented in these proposals and memoranda and approves all services it finds acceptable.
To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee has delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee the authority to amend or modify the list of audit and non-audit services and fees between meetings, as long as the additional or amended services do not affect Deloitte's independence under applicable rules. Any actions taken under this authority are reported to the Audit Committee at its next face-to-face Committee meeting.
All Deloitte services and fees in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chairman.

Audit Committee Report
In accordance with its charter adopted by the Board, the Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing the quality and integrity of Kimberly-Clark's accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices.
In discharging its oversight responsibility for the audit process, the Audit Committee obtained from the independent registered public accounting firm (the "auditor") a formal written statement describing all relationships between the auditor and Kimberly-Clark that might bear on the auditor's independence, as required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, discussed with the auditor any relationships that may impact the auditor's objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors, and the auditor, the quality and adequacy of Kimberly-Clark's internal controls and the internal audit function's organization, responsibilities, budget and staffing. The Audit Committee reviewed with both the auditor and the internal auditors their audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks.
The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the auditor all communications required by the PCAOB's auditing standards, including those required by PCAOB AS 16, "Communication with Audit Committees." Also, with and without management present, it discussed and reviewed the results of the auditor's examination of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting. The Committee also discussed the results of internal audit examinations.
Management is responsible for preparing Kimberly-Clark's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and for establishing and maintaining Kimberly-Clark's internal control over financial reporting. The auditor has the responsibility for performing an independent audit of Kimberly-Clark's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, and expressing opinions on the conformity of Kimberly-Clark's financial statements with GAAP and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed Kimberly-Clark's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, with management and the auditor. The Audit Committee also reviewed management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls as of December 31, 2018, and discussed the auditor's examination of the effectiveness of Kimberly-Clark's internal control over financial reporting.
Based on the above-mentioned reviews and discussions with management and the auditor, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that Kimberly-Clark's audited financial statements be included in Kimberly-Clark's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also has selected and recommended to stockholders for ratification the reappointment of Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Proposal 3. Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation
In the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows, we describe in detail our executive compensation program, including its objectives, policies and components. As discussed in that section, our executive compensation program seeks to align the compensation of our executives with our strategic objectives. To this end, the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") has adopted executive compensation policies that are designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Pay-for-Performance. Support a performance-oriented environment that rewards achievement of our financial and non-financial goals. 
►  Focus on Long-Term Success. Reward executives for long-term strategic management and stockholder value enhancement. 
►  Stockholder Alignment. Align the financial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. 
►  Quality of Talent. Attract and retain executives whose abilities are considered essential to our long-term success. 
[END TABLE]
For a more detailed discussion of how our executive compensation program reflects these objectives and policies, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our named executive officers, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," below.
We are asking our stockholders to support our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our executives and the objectives, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Corporation's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved by the Corporation's stockholders on an advisory basis.
The say-on-pay vote is advisory and is therefore not binding on Kimberly-Clark, the Committee or our Board. Nonetheless, the Committee and our Board value the opinions of our stockholders. Therefore, to the extent there is any significant vote against the executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Committee and our Board will consider our stockholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis  
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our compensation policies and decisions regarding 2018 compensation for our named executive officers.
For 2018, our named executive officers are:
In addition, we provide compensation information regarding our former officers, Larry P. Allgaier, our former Group President, K-C North America, and Gustavo Calvo Paz, our former President, K-C Europe, Middle East & Africa ("EMEA"). References in the following discussion to our "named executive officers" do not include these former officers unless we specify otherwise. We discuss the compensation of these former officers separately under "Executive Compensation for 2018 - Compensation of Former Named Executive Officers" below.
Mr. Hsu served as President and Chief Operating Officer during 2018 and succeeded Mr. Falk as Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2019. Also effective on that date, Mr. Falk was elected to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board.
As measured under our annual incentive program, we delivered the results below in net sales, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted operating profit return on sales (OPROS).
Table of Contents
Based on 2018 performance, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board (the "Committee") concluded that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  management did not deliver its financial targets for 2018, mostly due to category slowdown, a challenging competitive environment and higher-than-expected cost inflation, and 
►  management nevertheless continued to prioritize executing our long-term strategies, including: 
➢  focusing on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, 
➢  emphasizing market share improvement in our priority markets, 
➢  generating cost savings to help fund brand investments, and 
➢  focusing on cash generation and allocating capital in stockholder-friendly ways. 
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, the Committee approved annual cash incentives for 2018 below the target amount, including an incentive payout for the Chief Executive Officer at 49 percent of his target payment amount.
Performance-Based Compensation
Pay-for-performance is a key objective of our compensation programs. Consistent with that objective, performance-based compensation constituted a significant portion of our named executive officers' direct annual compensation targets for 2018. Also, to further align the financial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders, a majority of our executives' target direct annual compensation for 2018 was equity based.
COMPOSITION OF TARGET DIRECT COMPENSATION
Table of Contents
Committee Consideration of 2018 Stockholder Advisory Vote
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our executive compensation program received the support of approximately 95 percent of shares represented at the meeting. The Committee has considered the results of this vote and views this outcome as evidence of stockholder support of its executive compensation decisions and policies. Accordingly, the Committee has not made any substantial changes to its executive compensation policies for 2019. The Committee will continue to review the annual stockholder votes on our executive compensation program and determine whether to make any changes in light of the results.
CEO Target Direct Compensation and Realizable Direct Compensation
The following chart compares the Chief Executive Officer's target direct annual compensation and realizable direct compensation over the last three years. Realizable direct compensation reflects the actual compensation received for base salary and annual cash incentive plus the value of the long-term equity incentives granted in that year, determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  For unexercised stock options, the amount by which our 2018 year-end stock price ($113.94) exceeds the exercise price, if any, multiplied by the number of options granted and for exercised stock options, the  actual value realized upon exercise, and 
►  For performance-based restricted share units, intrinsic value is the number of units that were paid out based on actual performance (for the grant made in 2016) or are expected to be paid out based on projected  performance (for the grants made in 2017 and 2018), multiplied by our 2018 year-end stock price. 
[END TABLE]
Key factors causing realizable direct compensation to differ from target direct annual compensation over these three years are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Actual performance that resulted in annual cash incentives to be paid out at 109 percent of target (2016), 77 percent of target (2017) and 49 percent of target (2018), and 
►  Changes in our stock price over the last three years that significantly impacted the intrinsic value of stock options and the dollar value of performance-based restricted share units granted in each year. Our  stock prices on the dates stock options were granted to our Chief Executive Officer were $126.13 (2016), $132.82 (2017) and $103.06 (2018). 
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that this chart demonstrates that our Chief Executive Officer's realizable direct compensation varies from his target direct annual compensation based on our performance and stock price consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy.

Table of Contents
This section describes how the Committee thinks about annual compensation and the processes that it followed in setting 2018 target annual compensation for our named executive officers.
Focus on Direct Annual Compensation
In setting 2018 compensation for our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, the Committee focused on direct annual compensation, which consists of annual cash compensation (base salary and annual cash incentive) and long-term equity incentive compensation (performance-based restricted share units and stock options). The Committee considered annual cash and long-term equity incentive compensation both separately and as a package to help ensure that our executive compensation objectives are met.
Executive Compensation Peer Group
To ensure that our executive compensation programs are reasonable and competitive in the marketplace, the Committee compares our programs to those at other companies. In setting compensation in February 2018 for our named executive officers, the Committee used a peer group consisting of the following consumer goods and business-to-business companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Executive Compensation Peer Group 
[END TABLE]
The Committee generally seeks to select companies with whom Kimberly-Clark competes for talent. We believe that we generally compete for talent with consumer goods and business-tobusiness companies with annual revenues ranging from approximately one-half to two times our annual revenues. However, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate also to include certain companies outside of this annual revenue range because we directly compete with them for talent. 
In developing the peer group, the Committee does not consider individual company compensation practices, and no company has been included or excluded because it is known to pay above-average or below-average compensation. The Committee (working with compensation consultants retained separately by the Committee and the company), reviews the peer group annually to ensure that it continues to serve as an appropriate comparison for our compensation program. 
Table of Contents
Process for Setting Direct Annual Compensation Targets
In setting the direct annual compensation of our executive officers, the Committee evaluates both market data provided by the compensation consultants and information on the performance of each executive officer for prior years. To remain competitive in the marketplace for executive talent, the target levels for the executive officers' compensation components, including our Chief Executive Officer, are compared to the median of the peer group.
To reinforce a pay-for-performance culture, targets for individual executive officers may be set above or below this median depending on the individual's performance in prior years and experience in the position. The Committee believes that comparing target levels to the median, setting targets as described above, and providing incentive compensation opportunities that will enable executives to earn above-target compensation if they deliver above-target performance on their performance goals, are consistent with the objectives of our compensation policies. In particular, the Committee believes that this approach enables us to attract and retain skilled and talented executives to guide and lead our businesses and supports a pay-for-performance culture. At times, the Committee may award long-term equity incentive compensation to key individuals to address retention concerns.
When setting annual compensation for our executive officers, the Committee considers each compensation component (base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity incentive), but its decision regarding a particular component does not necessarily impact its decision about other components.
In setting compensation for executive officers that join us from other companies, the Committee evaluates both market data for the position to be filled and the candidate's compensation history. The Committee recognizes that in order to successfully recruit a candidate to leave his or her current position and to join Kimberly-Clark, the candidate's compensation package may have to exceed his or her current compensation, resulting in a package above the median of our peer group.
CEO Direct Annual Compensation
The Committee determines the Chief Executive Officer's direct annual compensation in the same manner as the direct annual compensation of the other named executive officers. For 2018, Mr. Falk's direct annual target compensation was at or near the median of direct annual compensation of chief executive officers of companies included in the peer group.
Table of Contents
Direct Annual Compensation Targets for 2018
Consistent with its focus on direct annual compensation, the Committee approved 2018 direct annual compensation targets for each of our named executive officers. The Committee believes that these target amounts, which formed the basis for the Committee's compensation decisions for 2018, were appropriate and consistent with our executive compensation objectives:
The Committee set Ms. Underhill's target upon her promotion from President, K-C Professional to Group President, K-C North America on May 10, 2018. Her actual payout target for her 2018 cash incentive was prorated based on time in each role as discussed below under "2018 Targets."
These 2018 direct annual compensation target amounts differ from the amounts set forth in the Summary Compensation Table in the following ways:
To help achieve the objectives discussed above, our executive compensation program for 2018 consists of fixed and performance-based components, as well as short-term and long-term components.
Base Salary
To attract and retain high caliber executives, we pay our executives an annual fixed salary that the Committee considers competitive in the marketplace.
Salary ranges and individual salaries for executive officers are reviewed annually, and salary adjustments generally are effective on April 1 of each year. In determining individual salaries, the Committee considers the salary levels for similar positions at our peer group companies, as well as the executive's performance, leadership and experience in his or her position. This performance evaluation is based on how the executive performs during the year against results-based objectives established at the beginning of the year and considers their demonstration of executive leadership characteristics. In general, an experienced executive who is performing at a satisfactory level will receive a base salary at or around the median of our peer group companies. However, executives may be paid above or below the median depending on their experience and performance.
Table of Contents
From time to time, if warranted, executives and other employees may receive additional salary increases because of promotions, changes in duties and responsibilities, retention concerns or market conditions.
The Committee approved the following base salaries for our named executive officers, effective April 1, 2018 (except for Ms. Underhill's which was effective May 10, 2018):
The Committee approved a 5.4 percent increase in Mr. Hsu's base salary to more closely align his salary with the median of our peer group. The Committee approved increases in Ms. Henry's and Mr. Palmer's base salaries of 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, consistent with the annual merit increase provided to all other company employees. The Committee determined Ms. Underhill's base salary and annual cash incentive target (see below) upon her promotion to Group President, K-C North America, taking into account market data for officers performing similar functions at our peer companies.
Annual Cash Incentive Program
Consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation objective, our executive compensation program includes an annual cash incentive program to motivate and reward executives in achieving annual performance objectives.
2018 TargetsThe target payment amount for annual cash incentives is a percentage of the executive's base salary. The Committee determines this target payment amount as described above under "Setting Annual Compensation – Process for Setting Direct Annual Compensation Targets." The range of possible payouts is expressed as a percentage of the target payment amount. The Committee sets this range based on competitive factors.
TARGET PAYMENT AMOUNTS AND RANGE OF POSSIBLE PAYOUTSFOR 2018 ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM
Table of Contents
2018 Performance Goals, Performance Assessments and Payouts Payment amounts under the annual cash incentive program are dependent on performance measured against corporate goals and business unit or staff function goals established by the Committee at the beginning of each year. These performance goals, which are communicated to our executives at the beginning of each year, are derived from our financial and strategic goals.
As shown in the table below, the Committee established goals for three different performance elements for 2018. It then weighted the three elements for each executive (note that the business unit or staff function performance goals did not apply to our Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Operating Officer because their responsibilities are company-wide). As it does each year, the Committee chose weightings that are intended to strike an appropriate balance between aligning each executive's individual objectives with our overall corporate objectives and holding the executive accountable for performance in the executive's particular area of responsibility.
ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 2018 PERFORMANCE GOALS AND WEIGHTS
Table of Contents
Below we describe the three elements of performance, explain how performance was assessed for each element, and show the payouts that were determined in each case.
⬛ ELEMENT 1: CORPORATE KEY FINANCIAL GOALS
For 2018, the Committee chose the following as corporate key financial goals for the annual cash incentive program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Net sales  Net sales for 2018  A key indicator of our overall growth 
 Adjusted EPS  Consists of diluted net income per share that is then adjusted to eliminate the effect of items or events that the Committee determines in its discretion should be excluded for compensation purposes(1)  A key indicator of our overall performance 
 Adjusted OPROS  After net sales and adjusted EPS are determined as described above, a multiplier based on adjusted OPROS is applied to the calculation result to determine the final payout percentage(2)  A measure of margin efficiency and a helpful method of tracking our cost structure performance 
(1) In 2018 the following adjustments were     made to diluted net income per share to determine adjusted EPS: 
 For more information regarding these adjustments,     see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2018 Annual     Report on Form 10-K. 
(2) For purposes of determining annual cash     incentive amounts, we calculate adjusted OPROS using our reported financial results, adjusted for the same items described     above in determining adjusted EPS. 
[END TABLE]
Because Element 1 represents key company-wide goals, it produces the same payout percentage for each named executive officer. To determine this percentage, the Committee follows the following process.
First, it determines an initial payout percentage based on how Kimberly-Clark performed against the net sales and adjusted EPS goals established in February of each year. For 2018, the Committee set these goals and the corresponding initial payout percentages at the following levels:
Second, it applies a multiplier to this initial payout percentage. The multiplier is based on how Kimberly-Clark performed against the adjusted OPROS goals also established in February. Depending on the level of basis point improvement, the multiplier may either decrease or increase the initial payout percentage (but the amount of the final payout percentage cannot exceed a 200 percent cap).
Table of Contents
For 2018, the Committee set the following ranges for this adjusted OPROS multiplier:
Actual results. For 2018, our net sales result was $18.49 billion and our adjusted EPS result was $6.61. Based on these results, the initial payout percentage was determined to be 47 percent. To this percentage, we then applied the OPROS multiplier of 0.80, because OPROS declined in 2018 and we failed to achieve the threshold goal.
The resulting 2018 payout percentage for achieving the corporate key financial goals was 38 percent of each named executive officer's target payment amount.
⬛ ELEMENT 2: ADDITIONAL CORPORATE FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC PERFORMANCE GOALS
At the beginning of 2018, the Committee also established additional corporate financial and non-financial strategic performance goals that are intended to challenge our executives to exceed our long-term objectives. At the end of the year, it determined a payout percentage based on its assessment of the degree to which these goals are achieved.
The Committee does not use a formula to assess the performance of these goals but instead takes a holistic approach and considers performance of all the goals collectively. Although it does review each goal separately, the key consideration for the Committee is how it views Kimberly-Clark's performance for the year in all of these categories, taken as a whole.
The chart below shows the 2018 goals and how the Committee assessed Kimberly-Clark's performance against each one:
Table of Contents
Actual payout percentage. After taking into account performance on all of these goals, the Committee determined that the payout percentage for achieving these other financial and strategic goals should be 75 percent of target.
⬛ ELEMENT 3: BUSINESS UNIT OR STAFF FUNCTION PERFORMANCE GOALS
In addition to the performance goals established by the Committee, our Chief Executive Officer establishes individual business unit or staff function performance goals that are intended to challenge the executives to exceed the objectives for that unit or function. These objectives include strategic performance goals for the business units and staff functions, as well as financial goals for the business units.
Following the end of the year, the executives' performance is analyzed to determine whether performance for the goals was above target, on target or below target. Our CEO then provides the Committee with an assessment of each individual business unit's or staff function's performance against the objectives for that unit or function.
Actual payout percentages. Based on the assessed performance of the relevant business unit or staff function against its pre-established performance goals, and taking into account the CEO's recommendations, the Committee determined the following payout percentages for business unit or staff function performance for our named executive officers:
Annual Cash Incentive Payouts for 2018The following table shows the payout opportunities and the actual payouts of annual cash incentives for 2018 for each of our named executive officers. Payouts were based on the payout percentages for each element, weighted for each executive as shown on page 47.
Summary of Annual Cash Incentive Payouts: 2014 through 2018 Generally, the Committee seeks to set the minimum, target and maximum levels such that the relative difficulty of achieving the target level is consistent from year to year. From 2014 through 2018, the average total payout percentage (including business unit or staff function performance) for the executives that were designated as named executive officers in (and were serving as such at the end of) those years ranged from 58 percent to 108 percent of target. The Committee believes that these payouts are consistent with how Kimberly-Clark performed during these years and reflect the pay-for-performance objectives of our executive compensation.
Table of Contents
PAYOUTS FOR CORPORATE GOALS AND AVERAGE TOTAL PAYOUT PERCENTAGES FOR DESIGNATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
The Committee awards long-term equity incentive grants to executive officers as part of their overall compensation package. These awards are consistent with the Committee's objectives of aligning our senior leaders' interests with the financial interests of our stockholders, focusing on our long-term success, supporting our performance-oriented environment and offering competitive compensation packages.
Information regarding long-term equity incentive awards granted to our named executive officers can be found under "Summary Compensation," "Grants of Plan-Based Awards," and "Discussion of Summary Compensation and Plan-Based Awards Tables."
2018 Grants In determining the 2018 long-term equity incentive award amounts for our named executive officers, the Committee considered the following factors, among others: the specific responsibilities and performance of the executive, our business performance, retention needs, our stock price performance and other market factors. Because these awards are part of our annual compensation program that compares direct annual compensation to the median of our peer group comparison, grants from prior years were not considered when setting 2018 targets or granting awards.
To determine target values, the Committee first compared each executive's direct annual compensation to the median of our peer group, and then considered individual performance and the other factors listed above, as applicable. Target grant values were approved in February 2018 and were divided into two types:
The Committee believes this allocation between performance-based restricted share units and stock options supports the pay-for-performance and stockholder alignment objectives of its executive compensation program.
Performance Goals and Potential Payouts for 2018 - 2020 Performance-Based Restricted Share Units For the performance-based restricted share unit awards granted in 2018, the actual number of shares to be received by our named executive officers can range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels established by the Committee for each executive, depending on the degree to which the performance objectives for these awards are met over a three-year period.
Table of Contents
The performance objectives for the 2018 awards are based on average annual net sales growth and the average adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) for the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. Adjusted ROIC is a measure of the return we earn on the capital invested in our businesses. It is calculated using our reported financial results, adjusted for the same items that we use in determining adjusted EPS. The formula we use to calculate adjusted ROIC can be found under the Investors section of our website at www.kimberly-clark.com.
2018 - 2020 PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS:  POTENTIAL PAYOUTS AT VARYING PERFORMANCE LEVELS
Payout of 2015 - 2017 Performance-Based Restricted Share UnitsIn February 2018, the Committee evaluated the results of the three-year performance period for the performance-based restricted share units that were granted in 2015. The performance objectives for these 2015 awards were based on average annual adjusted net sales growth and average adjusted ROIC for the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, each weighted equally.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 *  For purposes of calculating average adjusted ROIC, the Committee excluded from the calculation of operating profit and invested capital the impacts of charges related to (1) an exchange rate change in Venezuela, (2) our 2014 organization restructuring, (3) pension settlements, (4) our Turkey restructuring, (5) the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations and (6) tax reform. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this review, the Committee determined that we exceeded our performance goal for adjusted ROIC but did not achieve our performance goal for adjusted net sales growth. As a result, the payout percentage for the share units was 100 percent of target. The following table includes information about the opportunities and payouts (including reinvested dividends) regarding these grants to our named executive officers:
The Committee believes that these payouts further highlight the link between pay and performance established by our compensation program, which seeks to align actual compensation paid to our named executive officers with our long-term performance.
Table of Contents
The shares underlying these performance-based restricted share unit awards were distributed to our named executive officers in February 2018 (April 2018 in the case of Ms. Henry) and are included in the table below entitled "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018."
Vesting Levels of Outstanding Performance-Based Restricted Share Unit Awards As of February 6, 2019, the performance-based restricted share units granted in 2018 and 2017 were on pace to vest at the following levels: 34 percent for the 2018 award and 37 percent for the 2017 award.
The Committee has determined that the 2016 award vested at 97 percent. Payouts under these awards will be reflected in 2019 compensation.
2018 Stock Option Awards As noted above, 25 percent of the annual long-term equity incentive grants to executive officers in 2018 consisted of stock options. Stock option grants vest in three annual installments of 30 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The Committee believes that stock options help further align our executives' interest with those of our stockholders and encourage executives to remain with the company through the multi-year vesting schedule.
For purposes of determining the number of options to be granted, stock options were valued on the basis that one option has the same value as 12.5 percent of the price of one share of our common stock on the date of grant. Information regarding stock options granted to our named executive officers can be found under "Summary Compensation," "Grants of Plan-Based Awards," and "Discussion of Summary Compensation and Plan-Based Awards Tables."
Compensation of Former Named Executive Officers
On May 10, 2018, Mr. Allgaier's role changed to Senior Vice President and he served during a management transition period until he left the company on July 1, 2018. Prior to his departure, Mr. Allgaier received a base salary of $860,000. The Committee set Mr. Allgaier's target payment amount for the 2018 annual cash incentive program at 95 percent of his base salary; however, he did not receive a payout for 2018. In February 2018, Mr. Allgaier received a grant of 16,566 performance-based restricted share units; however, they were forfeited upon his departure.
On April 1, 2018, Mr. Calvo Paz's role changed from President, K-C EMEA to Senior Vice President and he served during a management transition period until he left the company on November 1, 2018. Prior to his departure, Mr. Calvo Paz received a base salary of $500,000. He received a prorated payout for 2018 under our annual cash incentive program based upon (1) an individual target of 70 percent of his base salary and (2) a payout equal to 100% of his target. In February 2018, Mr. Calvo Paz received a grant of 4,733 performance-based restricted share units and in May 2018 he received a grant of 13,584 stock options.
In addition to the compensation described above, both former officers received severance pay under the Severance Pay Plan and accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards under the terms of our 2011 Equity Participation Plan (the "2011 Plan"), described below under "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control - Severance Benefits - Departure of Former Named Executive Officers."
Table of Contents
Retirement Benefits
Our named executive officers receive contributions from us under the Kimberly-Clark Corporation 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Profit Sharing Plan") and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Supplemental Retirement 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Supplemental 401(k) Plan") and some executive officers participate in our frozen defined benefit pension plans depending on their hire date. These plans are consistent with those maintained by our peer group companies and are therefore necessary to remain competitive with them for recruiting and retaining executive talent. The Committee believes that these retirement benefits are important parts of our compensation program. For more information, see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation – Overview of 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan" and "Pension Benefits."
Other Compensation
We provide only limited perquisites to our executive officers, consistent with our focus on more direct, performance-sensitive compensation. Also, the Committee has eliminated tax reimbursement and related gross-ups for perquisites (including personal use of corporate aircraft), except for certain relocation benefits, further underscoring our focus on direct compensation.
Perquisites include personal financial planning services under our Executive Financial Counseling Program, an executive health screening program where executives may receive comprehensive physical examinations from an independent health care provider, and permitted personal use of corporate aircraft consistent with our policy. The personal financial planning program is designed to provide executives with access to knowledgeable financial advisors that understand our compensation and benefit plans and can assist our executives in efficiently and effectively managing their financial and tax planning issues. The executive health screening program provides executives with additional services that help maintain their overall health.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman may use our corporate aircraft for limited personal travel consistent with our executive security program, and security services are provided for these officers at all times, including at their offices, other company locations and their residences. The Board considers these security arrangements to be appropriate and reasonable in light of the security risks identified in the independent security assessment. In addition, if a corporate aircraft is already scheduled for business purposes and can accommodate additional passengers, executive officers and their guests may, under certain circumstances, join flights for personal travel. In 2018, we provided certain security services to Mr. Hsu, who was serving as our Chief Operating Officer. The incremental cost to us of providing security services at Mr. Falk's and Mr. Hsu's residences and personal travel for Mr. Falk and his guests on our corporate aircraft is included in "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table.
Post-Termination Benefits
We maintain two severance plans that cover our executive officers: the Severance Pay Plan and the Executive Severance Plan. An executive officer may not receive severance payments under more than one severance plan. Benefits under these plans are payable only if the executive's employment terminates under the conditions specified in the applicable plan. We believe that our severance plans are consistent with those maintained by our peer group companies and that they are therefore important for attracting and retaining executives who are critical to our long-term success and competitiveness. For more information about these severance plans and their terms, see "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control – Severance Benefits."
Table of Contents
Severance Pay Plan Our Severance Pay Plan provides severance benefits to most of our U.S. hourly and salaried employees, including our named executive officers, who are involuntarily terminated under the circumstances described in the plan. The objective of this plan is to facilitate the employee's transition to his or her next position, and it is not intended to serve as a reward for the employee's past service.
Executive Severance Plan Our Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits to eligible employees, including our named executive officers, in the event of a qualified termination of employment (as defined in the plan) in connection with a change of control. For an eligible employee to receive a payment under this plan, two things must occur: there must be a change of control of Kimberly-Clark, and the employee must have been involuntarily terminated without cause or have resigned for good reason (as defined in the plan) within two years of the change of control (often referred to as a "double trigger"). Each of our named executive officers has entered into an agreement under the plan that expires on December 31, 2020.
2019 Base Salary
The Committee approved the following base salaries for our named executive officers, effective April 1, 2019:
The Committee approved Mr. Hsu's base salary and target cash incentive in connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Falk's base salary and target cash incentive in connection with his election as Executive Chairman, in each case taking into account market data for officers performing similar functions at our peer companies. The Committee approved the salaries of the remaining named executive officers in February 2019, other than Mr. Palmer, who will depart the company on April 1, 2019.
2019 Annual Cash Incentive Targets
The Committee also established objectives for 2019 annual cash incentives, which will be payable in 2020. The target payment amounts and range of possible payouts for 2019 are as follows:
Table of Contents
As discussed in "2018 Performance Goals, Performance Assessments and Payouts" above, the Committee sets the appropriate split among the different elements of performance that make up our performance goals. The following are the 2019 performance goals and relative weights for our named executive officers:
The corporate key financial goals for 2019 are designed to encourage a continued focus on executing our long-term strategic objectives and include achieving net sales, adjusted EPS and adjusted OPROS goals.
The Committee also established other corporate financial and non-financial goals for 2019. These goals, intended to further align compensation with achieving our strategic objectives, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
►  Focusing on market share improvement in global markets   
►  Driving innovation   
►  Diversity and inclusion   
[END TABLE]
In addition, goals have been established for each named executive officer, other than our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Chairman, relating to his or her business unit or specific staff function.
Table of Contents
2019 Long-Term Equity Compensation Incentive Awards
In February 2019, the Committee approved long-term incentive compensation awards for the named executive officers consisting of awards of performance-based restricted share units with a value equal to 75 percent of the target grant value for long-term equity incentive compensation, with the balance of the value to be granted in stock options. The performance objectives for the performance-based restricted share unit awards granted in 2019 are based on average annual net sales growth and average adjusted ROIC improvement for the period January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021. The actual number of shares our named executive officers will receive will range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels established by the Committee for each executive, depending on the degree to which the performance objectives are met.
PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED SHARE UNITS GRANTED IN 2019
In February 2019, the Committee also approved the dollar amount of stock options to be granted to our named executive officers in May 2019, along with our annual stock option grants to other employees. The number of options they will receive will be based on the assumed value of our stock options on the date of grant.
Table of Contents
As a matter of sound governance, we follow certain practices with respect to our compensation program. We regularly review and evaluate our compensation practices in light of regulatory developments, market standards and other considerations.
Use of Independent Compensation Consultant
As previously discussed, the Committee engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group as its independent consultant to assist it in determining the appropriate executive officer compensation in 2018 under our compensation policies described above. Consistent with the Committee's policy in which its independent consultant may provide services only to the Committee, Semler Brossy had no other business relationship with Kimberly-Clark and received no payments from us other than fees and expenses for services to the Committee. See "Corporate Governance - Management Development and Compensation Committee" for information about the use of compensation consultants.
Adjustment of Financial Measures for Annual and Long-Term Equity Incentives
Financial measures for the annual and long-term equity incentive programs are developed based on expectations about our planned activities and reasonable assumptions about the performance of our key business drivers for the applicable period. From time to time, however, discrete items or events may arise that were not contemplated by these plans or assumptions. These could include accounting and tax law changes, tax credits or charges from items not within the ordinary course of our business operations, charges relating to currency exchange rate changes, restructuring and write-off charges, significant acquisitions or dispositions, and significant gains or losses from litigation settlements.
Under the Committee's exception guidelines regarding our annual and long-term equity incentive program measures, the Committee has adjusted in the past, and may adjust in the future, the calculation of financial measures for these incentive programs to eliminate the effect of the types of items or events described above. In making these adjustments, the Committee's policy is to seek to neutralize the impact of the unexpected or unplanned items or events, whether positive or negative, in order to provide consistent and equitable incentive payments that the Committee believes are reflective of our performance. In considering whether to make a particular adjustment under its guidelines, the Committee will review whether the item or event was one for which management was responsible and accountable, treatment of similar items in prior periods, the extent of the item's or event's impact on the financial measure, and the item's or event's characteristics relative to normal and customary business practices. Generally, the Committee will apply an adjustment to all compensation that is subject to that financial measure.
Pricing and Timing of Stock Option Grants and Timing of Performance-Based Equity Grants
Our policies and the terms of the 2011 Plan require stock options to be granted at no less than the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock option grants to our elected officers, including our executive officers, are generally made annually at a meeting of the Committee that is scheduled at least one year in advance, and the grants are effective on the date of this meeting. However, if the meeting occurs during the period beginning on the first day of the final month of a calendar quarter and ending on the date of our earnings release, the stock option grants will not be effective until the first business day following the earnings release. Our executives are not permitted to choose the grant date for their individual stock option grants.
Table of Contents
The Chief Executive Officer has been delegated the authority to approve equity grants, including stock options, to employees who are not elected officers of Kimberly-Clark. These grants include scheduled annual grants, which are subject to an annual limit set by the Committee, and recruiting and special employee recognition and retention grants, which may not exceed 200,000 shares in any calendar year. The Chief Executive Officer is not permitted to make any grants to any of our elected officers, including our executive officers.
Annual stock option grants to non-elected officers are effective on the same date as the annual stock option grants to our elected officers. Recruiting, special recognition and retention stock-based awards are made on pre-determined dates following our quarterly earnings releases. In May 2018, our Chief Executive Officer authorized an aggregate of 1.54 million options, performance-based restricted share units and time-vested restricted share units to employees who are not elected officers. In 2018, our Chief Executive Officer also authorized an aggregate of 47,606 shares underlying recruiting and retention grants, consisting of options, performance-based restricted share units and time-vested restricted share units.
With respect to grants of performance-based restricted share units to executive officers, the Committee's current practice is to approve the dollar value of the grants at its February meeting and the grants are effective on the last business day of February. We believe this practice is consistent with award practices at other large public companies. Our executives are not permitted to choose the grant date for their individual restricted stock or restricted share unit awards.
Policy on Incentive Compensation Clawback
As described in detail above, a significant percentage of our executive officer compensation is incentive-based. The determination of the extent to which the incentive objectives are achieved is based in part on the Committee's discretion and in part on our published financial results. The Committee has the right to reassess its determination of the performance awards if the financial statements on which it relied are restated. The Committee has the right to direct Kimberly-Clark to seek to recover from any executive officer any amounts determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer. In addition, under the 2011 Plan, the Committee may require awards with performance goals under the 2011 Plan to be subject to any policy we may adopt relating to the recovery of that award to the extent it is determined that performance goals relating to the awards were not actually achieved. Further, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandates that the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation paid to them in a year following the issuance of financial statements that are later required to be restated as a result of misconduct. The Committee intends to review and revise the incentive compensation clawback policy once the SEC issues final regulations on clawbacks under the Dodd-Frank legislation enacted in 2010.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We strongly believe that the financial interests of our executives should be aligned with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Committee has established stock ownership guidelines for our elected officers, including our named executive officers.
TARGET STOCK OWNERSHIP AMOUNTS
Table of Contents
Failure to attain these targeted stock ownership levels within five years from date of hire for, or appointment to, an eligible position can result in the reduction of part or all of the executive's annual cash incentive (with a corresponding grant of time-vested restricted share units or restricted stock in that amount), or a reduction in future long-term equity incentive awards, either of which may continue until the ownership guideline is achieved. In determining whether our stock ownership guidelines have been met, any time-vested restricted share units held are counted as owned, but performance-based restricted share units are excluded until they vest. Executive officer stock ownership levels were reviewed in 2018 for compliance with these guidelines. Based on our stock price as of the compliance date for this review, each of our named executive officers has met the applicable specified ownership level or is still within five years from date of hire or most recent promotion.
Insider Trading Policy; Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy
We require all executive officers to pre-clear transactions involving our common stock (and other securities related to our common stock) with our Legal Department.
Our insider trading policy prohibits any director, executive officer or any other officer or employee subject to its terms from entering into short sales or derivative transactions to hedge their economic exposure to our common stock. In addition, these directors, officers and employees are prohibited from pledging our stock, including through holding our stock in margin accounts.
Corporate Tax Deduction for Executive Compensation
The United States income tax laws generally limit the deductibility of compensation paid to certain "covered employees" including the chief executive officer and each of the three other highest-paid executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) to $1,000,000 per annum. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, expanded the number of covered employees to include the chief financial officer (and they remain covered employees for all future years) and eliminated the exception for certain performance-based compensation beginning with our 2018 tax year (subject to the grandfathering of certain preexisting arrangements). Several classes of our pre-existing compensation arrangements were designed to meet the previous requirements for deductibility.
Although tax deductibility of compensation is advantageous, the primary objective of our compensation programs is meeting the compensation objectives set forth above.
Table of Contents
In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board, the Management Development and Compensation Committee has oversight of compensation policies designed to align elected officers' compensation with our overall business strategy, values and management initiatives. In discharging its oversight responsibility, the Committee has retained an independent compensation consultant to advise the Committee regarding market and general compensation trends.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with our management, which has the responsibility for preparing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based upon this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Table of Contents
Based on this assessment, the Committee believes that the design of our compensation programs, including our executive compensation program, does not encourage our executives or employees to take excessive risks and that the risks arising from these programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Kimberly-Clark.
Several factors contributed to the Committee's conclusion, including:

Compensation Tables
Summary Compensation
The following table contains information concerning compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to our named executive officers in the last three years. Additional information regarding the items reflected in each column appears below the table and on page 69.
SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE
Table of Contents
Salary. The amounts in this column represent base salary earned during the year.
Bonus. The amount in this column reflects a one-time cash signing bonus paid as an incentive for Mr. Allgaier to join the company and to compensate him for compensation forfeited at his prior employer.
Stock Awards and Option Awards. The amounts in these columns reflect the dollar value of restricted share unit awards and stock options, respectively, granted under our stockholder-approved 2011 Plan.
The restricted share unit awards either vest over time or are based on the achievement of performance-based standards.
The amounts for each year represent the grant date fair value of the awards, computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. See Notes 6, 5 and 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the assumptions we used in valuing and expensing these restricted share units and stock option awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718.
For awards that are subject to performance conditions, the value is based on the probable outcome of the conditions at grant date. This value, as well as the value of the awards at the grant date assuming the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved and using the grant date stock price, is set forth below:

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. The amounts in this column are the annual cash incentive payments described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." These amounts were earned during the years indicated and were paid to our named executive officers in February of the following year.
Change In Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate change during the year in actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under all defined benefit and actuarial plans (including supplemental pension plans). With respect to the supplemental pension plans, amounts have been calculated to reflect an approximate 30-year Treasury bond rate to determine the amount of the earlier retirement age lump sum benefit in a manner consistent with our financial statements. We describe the assumptions we used in determining the amounts and provide additional information about these plans in "Pension Benefits."
Mr. Falk has compensation from before 2005 that he elected to defer pursuant to a Deferred Compensation Plan then in effect. Beginning in 2010, each of our named executive officers participates in the Supplemental 401(k) Plan, a non-qualified defined contribution plan. Earnings on each of these plans are not included in the Summary Compensation Table because the earnings were not above-market or preferential. See "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" for a discussion of these plans and each named executive officer's earnings under these plans in 2018.
All Other Compensation. All other compensation consists of the following:

Discussion of Summary Compensation and Plan-Based Awards Tables
Our executive compensation policies and practices, pursuant to which the compensation set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table was paid or awarded, are described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Other than the executive severance plans described below, none of our named executive officers has an employment agreement with us. See "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control."
Executive officers may receive long-term equity incentive awards of stock options, restricted stock or restricted share units, or a combination of stock options, restricted stock and restricted share units under the 2011 Plan, which was approved by stockholders in 2011. The 2011 Plan provides the Committee with discretion to require performance-based standards to be met before awards vest. In 2018, each named executive officer received grants of performance-based restricted share units under the 2011 Plan and each current named executive officer (as well as Mr. Calvo Paz) received grants of stock options.
For grants of stock options, the 2011 Plan provides that the option price per share shall be no less than the closing price per share of our common stock at the grant date. The term of any option is no more than ten years from the grant date. Options granted in 2018 become exercisable in three annual installments of 30 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date; however, all of the options become exercisable for the earlier of three years or the remaining term of the options upon death or total and permanent disability, and for the earlier of five years or the remaining term of the options, upon retirement of the officer. In addition, options generally become exercisable upon a termination of employment following a change of control, and certain options granted to our named executive officers are subject to our Executive Severance Plan. See "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control." The officers may transfer the options to family members or certain entities in which family members have interests.
Performance-based restricted share unit awards granted in 2018 vest three years following the grant date in a range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels. Awards that vest, if any, are based on our average annual net sales growth and average adjusted ROIC performance during the three years. As of February 6, 2019, the performance-based restricted share units granted in 2018 and 2017 were on pace to vest at the following levels: 34 percent for the 2018 award and 37 percent for the 2017 award. The Committee has determined that the 2016 award vested at 97 percent.
Dividend equivalents on unvested performance-based restricted share units equal to cash dividends on our common stock are accumulated and will be paid in additional shares after the performance-based restricted share units vest, based on the actual number of shares that vest, if any.

  In connection with the Halyard Health spin-off on October 31, 2014 the numbers of stock options were increased and the exercise prices were decreased to maintain the fair value of outstanding options immediately before and after the spin-off. Specifically, for each stock option held by a Kimberly-Clark employee, officer, or director, the exercise price was divided by 1.044134 (the "Adjustment Ratio") and the number of shares subject to the outstanding stock option was multiplied by the Adjustment Ratio, with fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. No incremental fair value was generated as a result of the adjustments.

Pension Benefits
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018 concerning potential payments to our named executive officers under our pension plan and supplemental pension plans. Information about these plans follows the table.
2018 PENSION BENEFITS
Employees who joined Kimberly-Clark prior to January 1, 1997 are eligible to participate in our pension plans, which provide benefits based on years of service as of December 31, 2009 and pay (annual cash compensation), integrated with social security benefits. Our pension plans are comprised of the Kimberly-Clark Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plans. We stopped accruing compensation and benefit service for participants under our pension plans for most of our U.S. employees, including our named executive officers, for plan years after 2009. These changes do not affect benefits earned by participants prior to January 1, 2010.
The following is an overview of these plans.
Table of Contents
Table of Contents
The estimated actuarial present value of the retirement benefits accrued through December 31, 2018 appears in the 2018 Pension Benefits table. For purposes of determining the present value of accumulated benefits, we have used the potential earlier retirement ages as described above rather than the normal retirement age under the plans, which is 65. For a discussion of how we value these obligations and the assumptions we use in that valuation, see Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The calculation of actuarial present value generally is consistent with the methodology and assumptions outlined in our audited consolidated financial statements, except that benefits are reflected as payable as of the date the executive is first entitled to full unreduced benefits (as opposed to the assumed retirement date) and without consideration of pre-retirement mortality. Present values for the qualified plan are based on the RP-2014 annuitant table, as adjusted for company experience and generational improvements using scale MP-2018, and for the supplemental plans were calculated using the 2019 417(e) mortality table adjusted for mortality improvement to the assumed retirement age using scale MP-2018. With respect to the supplemental pension plans, the amount of the earlier retirement age lump sum benefit was determined using an approximate 30-year Treasury Bond rate of 3.19%, consistent with the methodology used for purposes of our consolidated financial statements; any actual lump sum benefit would be calculated using the 30-year Treasury Bond rate in effect as of the beginning of the month prior to termination. Present value amounts were determined as of December 31, 2018 based on the financial accounting discount rates for United States pension plans of 4.38% and 4.34% for the qualified plan and the supplemental plans, respectively.
The actuarial decrease in 2018 of the projected retirement benefits can be found in footnote 1 to the Summary Compensation Table under the heading "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings." No payments were made to our named executive officers under our pension plans during 2018.
While the supplemental pension plans remain unfunded, in 1994 the Board approved the establishment of a trust and authorized us to make contributions to this trust in order to provide a source of funds to assist us in meeting our liabilities under our supplemental defined benefit plans. For additional information regarding these plans, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Benefits and Other Compensation – Retirement Benefits."

Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control
Our named executive officers are eligible to receive certain benefits in the event of termination of employment, including following a change of control. This section describes various termination scenarios as well as the payments and benefits payable under those scenarios.
Severance Benefits We maintain two severance plans that cover our executive officers, depending on the circumstances that result in their termination. Those plans include the Executive Severance Plan, which is applicable when an executive officer is terminated following a change of control, and the Severance Pay Plan, which is applicable in the event of certain other involuntary terminations. An executive officer may not receive severance payments under more than one of the plans described below.
Executive Severance Plan. We have agreements under our Executive Severance Plan with each named executive officer. The agreements provide that, in the event of a "Qualified Termination of Employment" (as described below), the participant will receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of:
In addition, nonqualified stock options will vest and be exercisable within the earlier of five years from the participant's termination or the remaining term of the option.
A "Qualified Termination of Employment" is a separation of service within two years following a change of control of Kimberly-Clark (as defined in the plan) either involuntarily without cause or by the participant with good reason. In addition, any involuntary separation of service without cause within one year before a change of control will also be determined to be a Qualified Termination of Employment if it is in connection with, or in anticipation of, a change of control.
The current agreements with our named executive officers expire on December 31, 2020, unless extended by the Committee.
These agreements reflect that the named executive officer is not entitled to a tax gross-up if the named executive officer incurs an excise tax due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Instead, payments and benefits payable to the named executive officer will be reduced to the extent doing so would result in the executive retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits.
The Board has determined the eligibility criteria for participation in the plan. Each named executive officer's agreement under the Executive Severance Plan provides that the executive will retain in confidence any confidential information known to the executive concerning Kimberly-Clark and Kimberly-Clark's business so long as such information is not publicly disclosed.
Table of Contents
Severance Pay Plan. Our Severance Pay Plan generally provides eligible employees (including our named executive officers) severance payments and benefits in the event of certain involuntary terminations. Under the Severance Pay Plan, a named executive officer (employed for at least one year) whose employment is involuntarily terminated would receive, subject to the Committee's discretion to modify the applicable amounts:
If the named executive officer's employment is involuntarily terminated within the first 12 months of employment, the Severance Pay Plan provides that the named executive officer would receive three months' base salary.
Severance pay under the Severance Pay Plan will not be paid to any participant who is terminated for cause (as defined under the plan), is terminated during a period in which the participant is not actively at work for more than 25 weeks (except to the extent otherwise required by law), voluntarily quits or retires, dies or is offered a comparable position (as defined under the plan).
A named executive officer must execute a full and final release of claims against us within a specified period of time following termination to receive severance benefits under our severance pay plans. Under the Severance Pay Plan, if the release has been timely executed, severance benefits are payable as a lump sum cash payment no later than 60 days following the participant's termination date. Any current year annual incentive award that is payable under the Severance Pay Plan will be paid at the same time as it was payable under the Executive Officer Achievement Award Program, but no later than 60 days following the calendar year of the separation from service.
2011 Plan. In the event of a "Qualified Termination of Employment" (as described below) of a participant in the 2011 Plan in connection with a change of control, all of the participant's awards not subject to performance goals would become fully vested. Any awards subject to performance goals will vest at the average performance-based restricted share unit payout for awards for the three prior fiscal years. Unless otherwise governed by another applicable plan or agreement, such as the terms of the Executive Severance Plan, options in this event would be exercisable for the lesser of three months or the remaining term of the option. If any amounts payable under the 2011 Plan result in excise tax due to the application of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2011 Plan provides that payments and benefits payable to the named executive officer will be reduced to the extent necessary so that no excise tax will be imposed if doing so would result in the executive retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits. A "Qualified Termination of Employment" is a termination of the participant's employment within two years following a change of control of Kimberly-Clark (as defined in the 2011 Plan), unless the termination is by reason of death or disability or unless the termination is by Kimberly-Clark for cause or by the participant without good reason.
Table of Contents
The 2011 Plan provides that, if pending a change of control, the Committee determines that Kimberly-Clark common stock will cease to exist without an adequate replacement security that preserves the economic rights and positions of the participants in the 2011 Plan (for example, as a result of the failure of the acquiring company to assume outstanding grants), then all options and stock appreciation rights will become exercisable, in a manner deemed fair and equitable by the Committee, immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control. In addition, the restrictions on all restricted stock will lapse and all restricted share units, performance awards and other stock-based awards will vest immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control and will be settled upon the change of control in cash equal to the fair market value of the restricted share units, performance awards and other stock-based awards at the time of the change of control.
In the event of a termination of employment of a participant in the 2011 Plan, other than a Qualified Termination of Employment, death, total and permanent disability or retirement of the participant, the participant will forfeit all unvested restricted stock and restricted share units, and any vested stock options held by the participant will be exercisable for the lesser of three months or the remaining term of the option.
Retirement, Death and Disability Retirement. In the event of retirement (separation from service on or after age 55), our named executive officers are entitled to receive:
Death. In the event of death while an active employee, the following benefits are payable:

Disability. In the event of a separation of service due to a total and permanent disability, as defined in the applicable plan, our named executive officers are entitled to receive:

Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control Table The following table presents the approximate value of (i) the severance benefits for our named executive officers under the Executive Severance Plan had a Qualified Termination of Employment under that plan occurred on December 31, 2018; (ii) the severance benefits for our named executive officers under the Severance Pay Plan if an involuntary termination had occurred on December 31, 2018; (iii) the benefits that would have been payable on the death of our named executive officers on December 31, 2018; (iv) the benefits that would have been payable on the total and permanent disability of our named executive officers on December 31, 2018; and (v) the potential payments to Messrs. Falk and Palmer if they had retired on December 31, 2018. If applicable, amounts in the table were calculated using the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 of $113.94 per share.
The termination benefits provided to our executive officers upon their voluntary termination of employment do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of our executive officers compared to the benefits offered to all salaried employees, so those benefits are not included in the table below. Of our current named executive officers, only Mr. Falk and Mr. Palmer were eligible to retire as of December 31, 2018; thus, potential payments assuming retirement on that date are not included for the other named executive officers.
The amounts presented in the table are in addition to amounts each named executive officer earned or accrued prior to termination, such as the officer's balances under our Deferred Compensation Plan, accrued retirement benefits (including accrued pension plan benefits), previously vested benefits under our qualified and non-qualified plans, previously vested options, restricted stock and restricted share units and accrued salary and vacation. For information about these previously earned and accrued amounts, see "Summary Compensation," "Outstanding Equity Awards," "Option Exercises and Stock Vested," "Pension Benefits," and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation."
Because Mr. Allgaier and Mr. Calvo Paz left the company on July 1 and November 1, 2018, respectively, they are discussed below under "Departure of Former Named Executive Officers."

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL TABLE
Table of Contents
Departure of Former Named Executive Officers Mr. Allgaier left the company on July 1, 2018. He received a payout under our Severance Pay Plan in the amount of $1,677,000, which represents the sum of Mr. Allgaier's annual base salary and target annual incentive award. Because Mr. Allgaier is over age 55, under the terms of the 2011 Plan, his unvested stock options vested on the date of his departure and will be exercisable until the earlier of five years or the remaining term of the options. Additionally, his unvested performance-based restricted share units will be payable in full based on attainment of the performance goal at the end of the performance period, except for those granted in 2018, which forfeited upon his departure. The value of the unvested stock options and performance-based restricted share units was $1,475,974 at the time of Mr. Allgaier's departure (assuming that all performance-based restricted share units vest at the target level). Under the terms of the 2011 Plan, Mr. Allgaier's unvested time-vested restricted share units were forfeited. Mr. Allgaier also received reimbursement for the relocation expenses included in "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table.
Mr. Calvo Paz left the company on November 1, 2018. He received a payout under our Severance Pay Plan in the amount of $1,538,696, which represents two times the sum of Mr. Calvo Paz's annual base salary and average annual incentive award for the three prior fiscal years. He received a prorated payout for 2018 under our annual cash incentive program which is shown in the Summary Compensation Table above. Because Mr. Calvo Paz is over age 55, under the terms of the 2011 Plan, his unvested stock options vested on the date of his departure and will be exercisable until the earlier of five years or the remaining term of the options, and his unvested performance-based restricted share units will be payable in full based on attainment of the performance goal at the end of the performance period. The value of the unvested stock options and performance-based restricted share units was $1,480,073 at the time of Mr. Calvo Paz's departure (assuming that all performance-based restricted share units vest at the target level).

Our Corporate Governance Policies provide that, within three years of joining the Board, all Outside Directors should own an amount of our common stock or share units at least equal in value to three times the annual Board cash compensation. For the purpose of these stock ownership guidelines, a director is deemed to own beneficially-owned shares, as well as restricted stock and restricted share units (whether or not any applicable restrictions have lapsed), but not stock options (whether vested or unvested). As of December 31, 2018, each Outside Director has met the specified ownership level or is still within three years of joining the Board.
The following table sets forth the information, as of December 31, 2018, regarding persons or groups known to us to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of our common stock.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   The address, number and percentage of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by The Vanguard Group Inc. ("Vanguard") are based on the Schedule 13G/A filed by Vanguard with the SEC on February 11, 2019. According to the filing, Vanguard had sole voting power with respect to 423,751 shares, sole dispositive power with respect to 27,085,549 shares, shared dispositive power with respect to 515,826 shares and shared voting power with respect to 97,856 shares. 
(2)   The address, number and percentage of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by BlackRock, Inc. ("BlackRock") are based on the Schedule 13G/A filed by BlackRock with the SEC on February 6, 2019. According to the filing, BlackRock had sole voting power with respect to 21,476,839 shares, sole dispositive power with respect to 24,634,126 shares, and did not have shared voting or dispositive power as to any shares. 
(3)   The address, number and percentage of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by State Street Corporation ("State Street") are based on the Schedule 13G filed by State Street with the SEC on February 14, 2019.

Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions. The Board has adopted procedures for reviewing any transactions between the company and certain "related persons" that involve amounts above certain thresholds. The SEC requires that our proxy statement disclose these "related person transactions." A related person is defined under the SEC's rules and includes our directors, director nominees, executive officers and five percent stockholders.
Table of Contents
The Board's procedures provide that:
Each director, director nominee and executive officer is required to promptly provide written notification of any material interest that he or she (or an immediate family member) has or will have in a transaction with Kimberly-Clark. Based on a review of the transaction, a determination will be made as to whether the transaction constitutes a related person transaction under the SEC's rules. As appropriate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Audit Committee will then review the terms and substance of the transaction to determine whether to ratify or approve the related person transaction.
In determining whether the transaction is consistent with Kimberly-Clark's best interest, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Audit Committee may consider any factors deemed relevant or appropriate, including:
2018 Related Person Transactions. We share aircraft hangar space, pilots and related services with Bergstrom Corporation, an entity that is majority-owned by Mr. Bergstrom. During 2018, Bergstrom Corporation paid us $494,000 for its share of the costs associated with these services. We believe this arrangement is fair and reasonable, advantageous to Kimberly-Clark, and consistent with national benchmarking. Based on an analysis of the arrangement, we also believe its terms to be comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed and approved the arrangement.
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation to the compensation of all our employees. For 2018:
Table of Contents
To identify our median employee, we compared the base salary, overtime, shift-differential, call-in and other statutory pay (e.g., 13-month bonus for certain Latin American employees) of our employees based on 10-month trailing payroll data as of October 31, 2018. We excluded the following numbers of our employees based in the following countries as permitted by SEC rules under a de minimis exemption: Ecuador (395), Honduras (254), Indonesia (313), Nicaragua (37), Nigeria (116), Panama (228), Ukraine (53), Vietnam (639). The total number of excluded employees (2,035) represents less than 5.0 percent of our population. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.
We have 41,871 employees, of which 11,369 are U.S. employees and 30,502 are non-U.S. employees. We used these actual numbers in our de minimis exemption calculation discussed above. Similar to our Chief Executive Officer, each of our employees enjoys a comprehensive compensation, benefit and company and/or state-sponsored retirement package that we determine by benchmarking to local market practice.
Stockholders who have the same address and last name as of the record date and have not previously requested electronic delivery of proxy materials may receive their voting materials in one of two ways. They may receive a single proxy package containing one annual report, one proxy statement and multiple proxy cards for each stockholder.
