[END TABLE]
Voting Matters i 
Proposal 1 — Election of Directors (see page 7) 
The following table provides summary information about each director nominee. To be elected, each nominee must receive more votes cast "for" such nominee's election than votes cast "against" such nominee's election. 
AC = Audit Committee 
CC = Compensation Committee 
EC = Executive Committee 
NG = Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
C = Chair of Committee 
If elected, the director nominees will serve until the 2020 annual meeting. The Board recommends a vote FOR each director nominee. 
ii 
Proposal 2 — Approval of Non-Binding Resolution Regarding Executive Officer Compensation (see page 71) 
We are asking stockholders to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The Board believes that its current compensation program uses a balanced mix of base salary, and annual and long-term incentives to attract and retain highly qualified executives; the compensation program also maintains a strong relationship between executive compensation and performance, thereby aligning the interests of the Corporation's executive officers with those of its stockholders. As evidenced by the results of our "say-on-pay" vote at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, with over 95% of the shares voted being voted in favor of the proposal, we believe that stockholders have indicated strong support for the structure and execution of our named executive officer compensation program. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. 
Highlights of our named executive officer compensation program, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• emphasis on performance-based compensation, with base salary being the  only fixed component of an executive officer's direct compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual long-term equity grants in the form of stock options, which  provide value only to the extent our stock price increases after the date of grant, performance-based restricted stock units, which serve to reward long-term performance, and time-based restricted stock units,  which serve as a strong retention tool thereby aligning management with the long-term interests of our stockholders through the various equity grant vehicles;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• double-trigger severance benefits and no tax gross-ups; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appropriate risk-management practices, including an annual review of our compensation-related risk profile, clawback and anti-hedging policies and stock ownership requirements.  
[END TABLE]
This advisory (non-binding) resolution regarding the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. 
iii 
Proposal 3 — Approval of the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (see page 73) 
The Board requests that you approve the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2019 Omnibus Plan"). We currently maintain the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated 2010 Plan (the "2010 Omnibus Plan") pursuant to which, as of December 6, 2018, there were approximately 7,106,148 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding awards and 3,537,180 shares of our common stock reserved and available for future awards. If the stockholders approve the 2019 Omnibus Plan, all future awards will be granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan and we will not grant any awards under the 2010 Omnibus Plan. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal 
Proposal 4 — Ratification of Independent Auditors (see page 80)
Although stockholder ratification is not required by law, we are asking stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Set forth below is summary information with respect to KPMG LLP's fees for services provided in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal.

PROXY STATEMENT 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
January 31, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished by Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. ("we," "us," or the "Corporation") in connection with a solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors to be voted at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on January 31, 2019. Whether you personally attend, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the annual meeting. Most stockholders have a choice of voting over the Internet, by using a toll-free telephone number, or by completing a proxy card and mailing it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Check your proxy card or the information provided to you by your bank, broker, or other stockholder of record to determine which voting options are available to you. The Internet voting and telephone voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available until 1:00 a.m., local time, on January 31, 2019. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card were first mailed on or about December  19, 2018. 
SOLICITATION AND RATIFICATION OF PROXIES 
If the enclosed form of proxy card is signed and returned, it will be voted as specified in the proxy, or, if no vote is specified, it will be voted "FOR" all nominees presented in Proposal 1, "FOR" the proposal set forth in Proposal 2, "FOR" the proposal set forth in Proposal 3, and "FOR" the proposal set forth in Proposal 4. If any matters that are not specifically set forth on the proxy card and in this Proxy Statement properly come to a vote at the meeting, the proxy holders will vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgments. At any time before the annual meeting, you may revoke your proxy by timely delivery of written notice to our Corporate Secretary, by timely delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy (including an Internet or telephone vote), or by voting via ballot at the annual meeting. Voting in advance of the annual meeting will not limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you decide to attend in person. If you are a beneficial owner, but your shares are registered in the name of a bank, broker, or other stockholder of record, the voting instructions form mailed to you with this Proxy Statement may not be used to vote in person at the annual meeting. Instead, to be able to vote in person at the annual meeting you must obtain, from the stockholder of record, a proxy in your name and present it at the meeting. See "Questions and Answers about the Meeting and Voting" in this Proxy Statement for an explanation of the term "stockholder of record." 
The proxy accompanying this Proxy Statement is being solicited by our Board of Directors. We will bear the entire cost of this solicitation, including the preparation, assembly, printing, and mailing of this Proxy Statement, the proxy, and any additional information furnished to our stockholders. In addition to using the mail, proxies may be solicited by directors, executive officers, and other employees of the Corporation, in person or by telephone. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, executive officers, or other employees for these services. We will also request banks, brokers, and other stockholders of record to forward proxy materials, at our expense, to the beneficial owners of our Common Stock. We have retained Alliance Advisors, LLC to assist us with the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of approximately $7,500, plus normal expenses not expected to exceed $5,000.  OUTSTANDING STOCK AND VOTING PROCEDURES 
Outstanding Stock 
The stockholders of record of our Common Stock at the close of business on December 6, 2018 will be entitled to vote in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. At that time, there were 120,544,100 shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Each stockholder will be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of Common Stock held. 
If you hold shares through an account with a bank, broker or other similar holder of record, the voting of the shares by the bank, broker or other similar holder of record when you do not provide voting instructions is governed by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). These rules allow banks, brokers and other similar holders of record to vote shares in their discretion on "routine" matters for which their customers do not provide voting instructions. On matters considered "non-routine," banks, brokers and other similar holders of record may not vote shares (referred to as "broker non-votes") without your instruction. 
Proposal 4 (the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our 2019 fiscal year) is considered a routine matter. Accordingly, banks and brokers may vote shares on this proposal without your instructions. 
However, Proposal 1 (election of directors), Proposal 2 (approval of an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement) and Proposal 3 (approval of the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement) are considered non-routine, and banks, brokers and other similar holders of record therefore cannot vote shares on these proposals without your instructions. Please note that if your shares are held through a bank, broker or other similar holder of record and you want your vote to be counted on this proposal, you must instruct your bank or broker how to vote your shares. 
Quorum 
A quorum for the transaction of business will be present if the holders of a majority of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to be cast thereat are present, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting. Your shares are counted as present if you attend the annual meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the annual meeting, the annual meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is present. 
Voting Procedures 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the meeting will be tabulated by the Inspector of Election from Computershare Trust Company, N.A. In addition, the following voting procedures will be in effect for each proposal described in this Proxy Statement: 
Proposal 1. Each director nominee must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting with respect to such nominee's election. That is each nominee must receive more votes cast "for" such nominee's election than votes cast "against" such nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect in determining whether the proposal has been approved. 
Proposal 2. The advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect in determining whether the proposal has been approved.  Proposal 3. The approval of the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as described in the Proxy Statement, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast affirmatively or negatively by the shares of stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will count as votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect in determining whether the proposal has been approved. 
Proposal 4. Ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions will have no effect in determining whether this proposal has been approved. Since this proposal is considered a routine matter, there will be no broker non-votes with respect to this proposal. 
If any other matters properly come before the meeting that are not specifically set forth on the proxy card and in this Proxy Statement, such matters shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, unless otherwise provided in our Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate of Incorporation"), Amended and Restated By-Laws ("By-Laws"), the Delaware General Corporation Law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. None of the members of our Board have informed us in writing that they intend to oppose any action intended to be taken by us. 
NO PERSON IS AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT, AND, IF GIVEN OR MADE, SUCH INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATIONS MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED. THE DELIVERY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT SHALL, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, CREATE ANY IMPLICATION THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR AFFAIRS SINCE THE DATE OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  What is a proxy?  
[END TABLE]
A proxy is your legal designation of another person, called a proxy holder, to vote the shares that you own. If you designate someone as your proxy holder in a written document, that document is called a proxy. We have designated Aaron E. Alt, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President, Sally Beauty Supply and Brently G. Baxter, our Group Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer and Controller, to act as proxy holders at the annual meeting as to all shares for which proxies are returned or voting instructions are provided by internet or telephonic voting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  What is a proxy statement?  
[END TABLE]
A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating the proxy holders described above to vote on your behalf. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a stockholder who holds stock in street name,  also called a "beneficial owner?"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares are registered in your name at Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are a stockholder of record.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares are registered at Computershare Trust Company, N.A. in the name of a broker, bank, trustee,  nominee, or other similar holder of record, your shares are held in street name and you are the beneficial owner of the shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  How do you obtain an admission ticket to personally attend the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of Record.  Your admission ticket is attached to your proxy card. You will  need to bring it with you to the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Street Name Holders.  You will need to ask your broker or bank for an admission ticket in the  form of a legal proxy and you will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting. If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, bring your most recent brokerage statement with you to the meeting. We can use that to verify your ownership of  Common Stock and admit you to the meeting; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. Please note that if you own shares in street name and you are issued a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will  be revoked and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
Please note that whether you are a stockholder of record or street name holder, you will also need to bring a government-issued photo identification card to gain admission to the annual meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  What different methods can you use to vote?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of Record.  If your shares are registered in your own name, you may vote by proxy or in person at the annual meeting. To vote by proxy, you may select one of the following options: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Written Proxy — You may vote by mailing the written proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone or Internet Proxy — You may also vote by telephone from the U.S. using the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card, or by the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card and other enclosures. The telephone and Internet voting procedures, including the  use of control numbers, are designed to authenticate our stockholders' identities, to allow our stockholders to vote their shares, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.  
[END TABLE]
 Street Name Holders.    If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other similar holder of record, you will receive instructions from such holder of record that you must follow for your shares to be voted. Please follow their instructions carefully. Also, please note that if the holder of record of your shares is a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must request a legal proxy or broker's proxy from such record holder that holds your shares and present that proxy and proof of identification at the annual meeting. 
See question 4 for a further description of how to obtain a legal proxy if your shares are held in street name. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  What is the record date and what does it mean?  
[END TABLE]
The record date for the annual meeting is December 6, 2018. The record date is established by our Board of Directors as required by Delaware law. Stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and to vote their shares at the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  What are your voting choices for director nominees, and what vote is needed to elect directors?   
[END TABLE]
For the vote on the election of the director nominees to serve until the 2020 annual meeting, stockholders may with respect to each nominee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote for such nominee,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote against such nominee, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• abstain from voting on such nominee.  
[END TABLE]
Each nominee will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting with respect to such nominee's election. 
If a nominee who currently is serving as a director does not receive the required vote for re-election, Delaware law provides that such director will continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover" director. However, pursuant to the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, each holdover director must tender, or has already tendered, an irrevocable resignation that would be effective upon the Board's acceptance of such resignation. In that situation, the Corporation's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject such resignation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  What are your voting choices on the proposal inviting stockholders to approve the advisory (non-binding) resolution endorsing the compensation of the Corporation's executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as discussed in this  Proxy Statement?  
[END TABLE]
In the vote on the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve the compensation of the Corporation's executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as discussed and disclosed in this Proxy Statement, stockholders may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote in favor of the proposal,

[END TABLE]
We will announce preliminary results at the annual meeting. We will report final results at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K.  PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors consists of twelve individuals, eleven of whom qualify as independent of us under the rules of the NYSE. Our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-Laws provide for the annual election of each of our directors for one-year terms. 
In light of the appointment of Ms. Paulonis on May 23, 2018, and Ms. Mooney on August 29, 2018, the Board of Directors, acting pursuant to the By-Laws, changed the size of the Board of Directors to twelve members. 
Following the recommendations of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Brickman, Mr. Eisenberg, Ms. Ferguson, Mr. Gibbs, Ms. Heasley, Mr. Magnacca, Mr. McMaster, Mr. Miller, Ms. Mooney, Ms. Mulder, Ms. Paulonis and Mr. Rabin for election or re-election to our Board of Directors. Ms. Button Bell will not stand for re-election at this meeting. Accordingly, this Proposal 1 seeks the election of these twelve directors to a term that will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all proxies that authorize the proxy holders to vote for the election of directors will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees listed below. If a nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of unforeseen circumstances, it is the intention of the proxy holders to vote for the election of such substitute nominee, if any, as the Board of Directors may propose. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, each of the nominees has consented to serve and the Board is not aware of any circumstances that would cause a nominee to be unable to serve as a director. 
Each of Mr. Brickman, Mr. Eisenberg, Mr. Gibbs, Ms. Heasley, Mr. Magnacca, Mr. McMaster, Mr. Miller, Ms. Mooney Ms. Mulder, Ms. Paulonis and Mr. Rabin are current directors with a term expiring at this annual meeting. If elected, this will be Ms. Ferguson's first term as a director.

[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance Philosophy 
We are committed to conducting our business in a way that reflects best practices and high standards of legal and ethical conduct. To that end, our Board of Directors has approved and oversees a comprehensive system of corporate governance policies and programs. These documents meet or exceed the requirements established by the NYSE listing standards and by the SEC and are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary under the guidance of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to reflect changes in regulatory requirements and evolving oversight practices. These policies embody the principles, policies, processes and practices followed by our Board, executive officers and employees in governing us. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors has adopted our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines that apply to our directors, officers and employees. Copies of these documents and the charters for our Board committees are available on our website at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and are available in print to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations. We intend to disclose on our website any substantive amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, our principal accounting officer or persons performing similar functions. We have not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement the information included on or linked from our website, and you should not consider it to be part of this Proxy Statement. 
Director Independence 
Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of eleven non-management directors and Mr. Brickman, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our directors are deemed independent if the Board has made an affirmative determination that such director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us) and such director also satisfies the other independence requirements of the NYSE. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that all of our directors, other than Mr. Brickman, satisfy the independence requirements of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as the NYSE, relating to directors. As part of its annual evaluation of director independence, the Board examined (among other things) whether any transactions or   relationships exist currently (or existed during the past three years), between each independent director and us, our subsidiaries, affiliates, equity investors, or independent auditors and the nature of those relationships under the relevant NYSE and SEC standards. The Board also examined whether there are (or have been within the past year) any transactions or relationships between each independent director and members of the senior management of the Corporation or its affiliates. 
All of our directors who serve as members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent as required by the NYSE corporate governance rules. In addition, all of our Audit Committee members also satisfy the separate SEC independence requirements applicable to audit committee members and all of our Compensation Committee members satisfy the additional NYSE independence requirements applicable to compensation committee members. 
Nomination of Directors 
The Board of Directors is responsible for nominating directors for election by our stockholders and filling any vacancies on the Board of Directors that may occur. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals it believes are qualified to become members of the Board of Directors. We anticipate that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations for director nominees from a wide variety of sources, including other members of the Board of Directors, management, stockholders and, if deemed appropriate, from professional search firms. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into account the applicable requirements for directors under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into consideration such other factors and criteria as it deems appropriate in evaluating a candidate, including such candidate's judgment, skill, integrity, and business and other experience and the perceived needs of the Board of Directors at that time. With regard to diversity, the Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that sound governance of the Corporation requires a wide range of viewpoints. As a result, although the Board of Directors does not have a formal policy regarding board diversity, the Board of Directors and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that the Board of Directors should be comprised of a well-balanced group of individuals with diverse backgrounds, educations, experiences and skills that contribute to board diversity, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers such factors when reviewing potential director nominees. 
Stockholder Recommendations or Nominations for Director Candidates 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will accept for consideration submissions from stockholders of recommendations for the nomination of directors. Acceptance of a recommendation for consideration does not imply that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will nominate the recommended candidate. Director nominations by a stockholder or group of stockholders for consideration by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders, or at a special meeting of our stockholders that includes on its agenda the election of one or more directors, may only be made pursuant to Section 1.06 or Section 1.07, as applicable, of our By-Laws or as otherwise provided by law. Nominations pursuant to our By-Laws are made by delivering to our Corporate Secretary, within the time frame described in our By-Laws, all of the materials and information that our By-Laws require for director nominations by stockholders. All notices of intent to make a nomination for election as a director shall be accompanied by the written consent of each nominee to serve as a director. 
Stockholders wishing to recommend or nominate a director must provide a written notice to our Corporate Secretary that includes, among other information required to be provided by our By-Laws, (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of the nominee(s), (b) the principal occupation   or employment of the nominee(s), (c) such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected, (d) the class or series and number of shares of Common Stock which are owned beneficially or of record by the nominee(s), (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and the nominee(s) pursuant to which nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (f) such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation or whether such nominee would be independent under applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations and New York Stock Exchange rules and the Corporation's publicly disclosed Corporate Governance Guidelines. No person shall be eligible to serve as a director of the Corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.06 or Section 1.07, as applicable, of our By-Laws; any nominee proposed by a stockholder not nominated in accordance with Section 1.06 or Section 1.07, as applicable, shall not be considered or acted upon for execution at such meeting. Stockholders' notice for any proposals requested to be included in the Corporation's Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (including director nominations), must be made in accordance with that rule. 
Director Qualifications 
In order to be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that each candidate for director must, at a minimum, have integrity, be committed to act in the best interest of all of our stockholders, and be able and willing to devote the required amount of time to our affairs, including attendance at Board of Director meetings. In addition, the candidate cannot jeopardize the independence of a majority of the Board of Directors. The candidate should preferably also have the following qualifications: business experience, demonstrated leadership skills, experience on other corporate boards and skill sets that add to the value of our business. 
Annual Election of Directors 
In 2014, the Board of Directors implemented a process to declassify the Board and provide for the annual election of all directors for one-year terms. Our stockholders approved the declassification proposal at our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders. At the annual meeting each year, all directors of the Board will be elected for one-year terms. 
With the appointment of Ms. Paulonis on May 23, 2018, the Board decided to change its size from ten to eleven members. With the appointment of Ms. Mooney on August 29, 2018, the Board decided to change its size from eleven to twelve members. Ms. Button Bell will not stand for re-election and Ms. Ferguson will stand for election for the first time. At this annual meeting, our stockholders will elect twelve individuals to serve on our Board. 
Mandatory Retirement Age 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, it is the policy of the Board that no non-management director should serve for more than 15 years in that capacity, although the Board may request that a director who would otherwise be due to retire continue his or her service if (a) the policy would result in multiple retirements in any 12-month period or (b) the Board deems such service to be in the best interest of our stockholders. 
Directors Who Change Their Present Job Responsibility 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a director who experiences a significant change in job responsibilities or assignment will be required to submit a resignation to the Board. The remaining directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, will then determine the appropriateness of continued Board membership.  Stockholder-Director Communications 
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of our Board (including the non-management directors as a group, the Chairman of the Board, any Board committee or any chair of any such committee) by addressing written correspondence to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at 3001 Colorado Boulevard, Denton, Texas 76210. Our Corporate Secretary's office will open all communications received for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to our directors. Any contents that legitimately relate to our business and operations and that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service, patently offensive material, charitable requests, repetitive materials, or designed to promote a political or similar agenda will be forwarded promptly to the addressee. 
Self-Evaluation 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees a self-evaluation of the Board each year to determine whether the Board is functioning effectively. In addition, each committee of the Board conducts a self-evaluation each year and reports its findings to the Board. 
Board Meetings and Attendance 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our directors are expected to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• regularly attend meetings of the Board and the committees of which they are members (as well as each annual  meeting of stockholders);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• spend the time needed to properly discharge their responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with respect to our non-management directors, meet at regularly scheduled  executive sessions in which management does not participate, which sessions are chaired by the Chairman of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with respect to our independent directors, meet at least once a year in an executive session without management,  which session is chaired by the Chairman of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
In fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors met 9 times, our Audit Committee met 5 times, our Compensation Committee met 6 times, our Executive Committee met 10 times, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met 5 times. Our independent directors met in executive session 6 times. During fiscal 2018, each of our incumbent directors attended at least 75% percent of the total number of meetings of the Board (during his or her service on the Board) and each committee on which he or she served (during his or her service on such committee). In 2018, all members of the Board attended the Corporation's annual meeting of stockholders. 
Board Leadership Structure 
In accordance with our By-Laws, the Board elects our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman, and each of these positions may be held by the same person or may be held by two persons. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board does not have a policy, one way or the other, on whether the role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separate and, if it is to be separate, whether the Chairman should be selected from the non-management directors or be a management director. However, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, if the Chairman of the Board is not an independent director, the independent directors shall appoint from among themselves a Lead Independent Director. The Chairman of the Board is responsible for chairing Board meetings and meetings of stockholders, establishing the agendas for Board meetings along with the Lead Independent Director, if any, and providing information to the Board members in advance of meetings and between meetings. The Lead Independent Director, if any, is responsible for, among other things, coordinating the activities of the independent directors, coordinating with the Chairman to set the agenda for Board meetings, chairing   executive sessions of the independent (and non-management) directors, reviewing and approving meeting schedules and information sent to the Board and liaising with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and the other independent directors. 
Mr. Brickman serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Mr. McMaster serves as our Chairman of the Board. Our Board has determined that this leadership structure is appropriate at this time. In particular, our Board believes that this structure streamlines decision making and enhances accountability. Furthermore, our Board believes that the presence of an independent Chairman of the Board and a majority of independent directors provides effective oversight of management. 
Board's Role in the Risk Management Process 
The Board's role in the risk management process is to understand and oversee the Corporation's strategic plans, the associated risks and the steps that senior management is taking to manage and mitigate those risks. To ensure proper oversight of the risk management process, the Audit Committee outlines our risk principles and management framework and sets high level strategy and risk tolerances. Our risk profile is managed by our Director of Internal Audit, reporting to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Director of Internal Audit meets at least quarterly in executive session with the Audit Committee, and conducts an annual Enterprise Risk Assessment for the Corporation. This assessment is then presented to the Audit Committee (for development of action items and responsible parties for oversight), the full Board (for information) and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (to ensure appropriate Board oversight of the identified risks). This approach is designed to enable the Board and management to establish a mutual understanding of the Corporation's risk management practices and capabilities, to review the Corporation's risk exposure and to elevate certain key risks for discussion at the Board level. The Board also meets regularly in executive session without management to discuss a variety of topics, including risk management. Through this system of checks and balances, the Board is able to monitor our risk profile and risk management activities on an ongoing basis. Certain officers who report to the Chief Financial Officer also monitor various financial risks which add to the Corporation's overall risk management strategy. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed with management the design and operation of our incentive compensation arrangements, including the performance objectives and target levels used in connection with incentive awards, for the purpose of assuring that these arrangements do not provide our executives or employees with incentive to engage in business activities or other behavior that would impose unnecessary or excessive risk to the value of the Corporation or the investments of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee considered compensation programs that apply to employees at all levels. In addition, the Compensation Committee considered the presence of significant risk mitigation factors inherent in our compensation program, such as those described on page 28 under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Management of Compensation-Related Risk." 
Based on the foregoing, the Compensation Committee concluded in its April 2018 meeting that the Corporation's compensation plans, programs and policies do not create incentives that encourage employees to take risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation. We believe that our incentive compensation plans, policies and practices provide appropriate incentives for behaviors that are within the Corporation's ability to effectively identify and manage significant risks, are compatible with effective internal controls and our risk management practices and are supported by the oversight and administration of the Compensation Committee with regard to executive compensation programs.  Committees of the Board of Directors 
Pursuant to our By-Laws, our Board of Directors has established the following committees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive Committee.

The function of each committee is described below. 
Each committee, pursuant to its charter adopted by the Board of Directors, consists of at least three members. 
Audit Committee.    The Audit Committee currently consists of Mr. McMaster (chair), Mr. Eisenberg, Ms. Heasley, Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Miller, and Ms. Paulonis. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate, that each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence requirements of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and that each of Mr. Eisenberg, Mr. Gibbs, Mr. McMaster, Mr. Miller, and Ms. Paulonis qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under SEC rules. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality and integrity of our financial statements, including oversight responsibility for management's  design and implementation, and the effectiveness of, internal controls;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval Policy.    The Audit Committee has established an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy to pre-approve all permissible audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors. We expect that on an annual basis, the Audit Committee will review and provide pre-approval for certain types of services that may be rendered by the independent auditors, together with a budget for the applicable fiscal year. The policy also requires the pre-approval of any fees that are in excess of the amount budgeted by the Audit Committee. The policy contains a provision delegating limited pre-approval authority to the chairman of the Audit Committee in instances when pre-approval is needed prior to a scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The chairman of the Audit Committee is required to report on such pre-approvals at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. 
The Audit Committee is governed by the Audit Committee charter. A copy of this charter is available on the corporate governance section of our website at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and is available in print to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Compensation Committee.    The Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Rabin (chair), Ms. Button Bell, Mr. Magnacca, and Ms. Mulder. The Board has determined that each such member meets the independence requirements of the NYSE, as well as the "Non-Employee Director" requirements under  Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and the "outside director" requirements under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prepare the reports and analysis on executive compensation, which are required to be included in our annual proxy  statements.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's processes for fulfilling its responsibilities and duties with respect to executive compensation and the role of our executive officers and management in the compensation process are each described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Processes for Determining Executive Compensation" beginning on page 28 of this Proxy Statement. 
The Compensation Committee is governed by the Compensation Committee charter. A copy of this charter is available on the corporate governance section of our website at http:// investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and is available in print to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee may create one or more subcommittees and may delegate, in its discretion, all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to such subcommittees. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee may retain such compensation consultants, outside counsel and other advisors as it may deem appropriate in its sole discretion and it has the sole authority to approve related fees and other retention terms. As described in greater detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Processes for Determining Executive Compensation" beginning on page 28 of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee engages an independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., or FW Cook, to assist it in its review of our management compensation levels and programs to ensure that our executive compensation program is commensurate with those of public companies similar in size and scope to us. During its engagement, FW Cook has participated in meetings of the Compensation Committee and advised it with respect to compensation trends and practices, plan design and the reasonableness of individual awards. FW Cook has not performed any services for our management. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Mr. Eisenberg (chair), Ms. Heasley, Ms. Mulder and Mr. Rabin. The Board has determined that each such member meets the independence requirements of the NYSE. The purpose of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identify individuals qualified and suitable to become members of our Board of Directors and to recommend to our  Board of Directors the director nominees for each annual meeting of stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consider any director candidates recommended by our stockholders pursuant to the procedures described in this  proxy statement and in our By-Laws;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• develop and recommend to our Board of Directors a set of corporate governance principles applicable to us; and

The purpose of the Executive Committee is to assist our Board of Directors with its responsibilities and, except as may be limited by law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our By-Laws, to exercise the powers and authority of our Board of Directors when it is not in session. The Executive Committee is governed by the Executive Committee charter. A copy of this charter is available on the corporate governance section of our website at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and is available in print to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Director Indemnification Agreements 
Our Board of Directors approved and authorized us to enter into an indemnification agreement with each member of the Board. The indemnification agreement is intended to provide directors with the maximum protection available under applicable law in connection with their services to us. 
Each indemnification agreement provides, among other things, that subject to the procedures set forth therein, we will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify an indemnitee if, by reason of such indemnitee's corporate status as a director, such indemnitee incurs any losses, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened, pending or completed proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative nature. In addition, each indemnification agreement provides for the advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee, subject to certain exceptions, in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement. Each indemnification agreement also requires that we cover an indemnitee under liability insurance available to any of our directors, officers or employees. Our indemnification obligations under these agreements are primary for all claims against our directors. 
No Material Proceedings 
As of November 14, 2018 there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates, or any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of our Common Stock (or their associates) is a party adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
The Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Rabin (chair), Ms. Button Bell, Mr. Magnacca, and Ms. Mulder. No member of our current Compensation Committee is or has been one of our officers or employees or has had any relationship requiring disclosure under SEC rules. In addition, during fiscal 2018, none of our executive officers served as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence  of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another corporation, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a director of another corporation, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing similar functions or, in the absence  of such committee, the entire board of directors) of another corporation, one of whose executive officers served as one of our directors.  
[END TABLE]
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Statement of Policy with respect to Related Party Transactions 
Our Board of Directors recognizes that interested transactions with related parties present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest or the perception thereof and therefore adopted a Statement of Policy with respect to Related Party Transactions, which was amended and restated in July 2016. Under this policy, an "interested transaction" is defined as any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to exceed $20,000 in any calendar year, (2) the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than ten percent beneficial owner of another entity). Any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by the Corporation to a charitable organization, foundation or university at which a related party's only relationship is as an employee, an officer or a director also constitutes an interested transaction. A "related party" is defined as any person who is or was (since the beginning of the last fiscal year for which the Corporation has filed an Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if such person does not presently serve in that role) (1) any officer (including at the Vice President level or above), director or nominee for election as a director of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a greater than five percent beneficial owner of any class of the Corporation's Common Stock or other equity securities, or (3) an immediate family member of any of the foregoing individuals. 
Subject to several exceptions (as described below), all interested transactions must be approved or ratified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, taking into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances, as well as the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. An interested transaction may be approved or ratified if it is determined in good faith that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is fair to the Corporation. The Audit Committee may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on the Corporation or the related party in connection with the approval of the transaction. 
No director participates in any discussion or approval of an interested transaction for which he or she is a related party, except to the extent the director provides material information concerning the transaction to the Audit Committee. If an interested transaction remains ongoing, the Audit Committee must review and assess, on at least an annual basis, ongoing relationships with the related party to ensure that the interested transaction remains appropriate. In addition, if an interested transaction involving a member of the Board may constitute an actual or potential director conflict of interest, the General Counsel shall notify the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of such interested transaction. 
Under the policy, the following categories of interested transactions have been deemed by the Audit Committee to be pre-approved, even if in excess of $20,000, unless otherwise specifically determined by the committee: (1) any employment by the Corporation of an officer of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries if the related compensation is approved (or recommended to the Board of Directors for approval) by the Corporation's Compensation Committee, (2) any compensation paid to a director if the compensation is consistent with the Corporation's director compensation policies and is required to be reported in the Corporation's proxy statement under Item 402, (3) any transaction with another company at which a related party's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or director) or beneficial owner of less than ten percent of that company's equity, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $120,000, or two percent of that company's total annual revenues, and (4) any transaction where the related party's interest arises solely from the ownership of the Corporation's Common Stock and all holders of the Corporation's Common Stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis (e.g., dividends).  All interested transactions with related parties were disclosed in the Corporation's Proxy Statement in accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. A copy of our Statement of Policy with respect to Related Party Transactions is available on the corporate governance section of our website at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and is available in print to any person, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations.

 Narrative Discussion of Director Compensation Table 
The following is a narrative discussion of the material factors which we believe are necessary to understand the information disclosed in the Director Compensation Table. The Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Independent Director Compensation Policy (the "Director Compensation Policy") governs the compensation paid to our independent directors. FW Cook reviews our director compensation program bi-annually, and FW Cook last completed such review in 2016 for application in fiscal year 2018. 
Cash Compensation 
In fiscal year 2018, pursuant to the Director Compensation Policy, each of our independent directors received an annual cash retainer of $55,000, payable in advance in four quarterly installments. For in-person Board or committee meetings during our 2018 fiscal year, each independent director in attendance received $2,000 per meeting. For telephonic Board or committee meetings for which minutes were kept, each independent director in attendance received $1,000 per meeting. 
Additional annual cash retainers were paid to each independent director who served as the Chairman of the Board (Mr. McMaster) or chairperson of the Audit Committee (Mr. McMaster), Compensation Committee (Mr. Rabin), or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (Mr. Eisenberg). The following table sets forth the cash retainers for services rendered in fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Non-Executive Chairman    $ 150,000   
 Audit Committee    $ 25,000   
 Compensation Committee    $ 20,000   
 Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee    $ 18,000   
[END TABLE]
In addition, in fiscal year 2018 the chairman of the Board (Mr. McMaster) received an additional $100,000 Non-Executive cash retainer in recognition of his increased workload during the fiscal year. 
Equity-Based Compensation 
Pursuant to our Director Compensation Policy, each independent director was granted an annual equity-based retainer award with a value at the time of grant of approximately $125,000. For fiscal year 2018, these awards were granted in accordance with the 2010 Omnibus Plan in the form of RSUs that vested on September 30, 2018, the last day of the fiscal year, subject to the director's continued service on the Board on such date. On November 1, 2017, each independent director received an award of 7,175 RSUs, except Ms. Paulonis who received a prorated award of 2,901 RSUs when she was appointed on May 23, 2018 and Ms. Mooney who received a prorated award of 717 RSUs when she was appointed on August 29, 2018. As provided in the Director Compensation Policy, each independent director may elect to defer delivery of the shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be due on the vesting date until a later date specified by the independent director. If an independent director does not make such election, he or she will receive shares of Common Stock in settlement of the RSU on the vesting date. Vesting accelerates on a pro-rata basis in the event of the director's death or disability. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
Pursuant to our stock ownership guidelines, each independent director must own shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to five times the base annual cash retainer (excluding additional annual cash retainers for the Chairman of the Board and committee chairpersons, and all meeting fees). Independent directors are required to achieve the applicable level of ownership within five years of becoming subject to the requirements. Until such time as the required equity ownership is reached, the independent director must retain 100% of the shares of Common Stock received upon settlement of his or her RSUs. Shares underlying vested RSUs (including deferred shares) count towards the stock ownership total. Unexercised   options (whether vested or unvested) and unvested RSUs do not count as stock owned under the guidelines. As of November 14, 2018, all of our independent directors were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines. 
Travel Expense Reimbursement 
Each of our independent directors is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses properly incurred in connection with his or her functions and duties as a director. With respect to air travel, reimbursements are limited to the cost of first-class commercial airline tickets for the trip.

Executive Overview 
Our Business 
We are the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the U.S. based on store count. We operate primarily through two business units, Sally Beauty Supply and Beauty Systems Group, or BSG. Through Sally Beauty Supply and BSG (which primarily operates stores under the CosmoProf service mark), we operated a multi-channel platform of 5,156 stores and supplied 184 franchised stores primarily in North America, South America and selected European countries, as of September 30, 2018. Within BSG, we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in North America, with approximately 820 professional distributor sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals. Sally Beauty Supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals, while BSG exclusively targets salons and salon professionals.  Fiscal 2018 Business Highlights 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the full fiscal year, consolidated net sales were $3.93 billion, a decrease of 0.1%, and same  store sales declined 1.5%. Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of approximately 80 basis points on full year consolidated sales growth. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Full year gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 49.4%. In the Sally segment, margin decreases were  driven primarily by a geographic revenue mix shift towards the segment's lower margin international business and increased coupon redemptions. In the Beauty Systems Group segment, margin declines were driven by opportunistic purchases that were  not repeated from the prior year and lower vendor allowances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• GAAP operating earnings for the full fiscal year were $426.6 million, compared to $478.6 million for  fiscal 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• GAAP net earnings for the full fiscal year were $258.0 million, an increase of $43.0 million or  20.0% compared to fiscal 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• GAAP diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year were $2.08, representing a 33.3% increase over  fiscal 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Full-year Adjusted EBITDA was $587.5 million, a decrease of 5.9% from fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as GAAP net earnings before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, share-based compensation, and certain  non-recurring items. For a more detailed discussion of and reconciliation of our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, see Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 14, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.08, representing a 33.3% increase over fiscal 2017. 
Growth in EPS  2018 Executive Compensation Events 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive compensation was primarily delivered through a combination of base salary, annual incentives and  long-term incentives in the form of stock options, performance-based restricted stock units (PBRSUs) and time-based restricted stock awards (TBRSAs). Our program closely  links realized compensation to the achievement of financial objectives and increases in the Corporation's stock price. Sixty percent of Mr. Brickman's fiscal 2018 target compensation was  performance-based and contingent upon the achievement of financial performance objectives or, in the case of stock options, increases in our stock price.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under our long-term incentive program, our named executive officers  received 33% of their fiscal 2018 equity-based compensation in the form of PBRSUs, 33% in TBRSAs and the remaining portion in the form of time-based stock options (34%).  PBRSUs vest based on achievement of 3-year sales growth and return on invested capital goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On October 1, 2017, Mr. Sherman was promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer  and his annual base salary was increased to $360,000 and his bonus target was increased to 60% of his base annual salary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On January 25, 2018, Mr. Haltom, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the  Company, separated from the Corporation. In order to obtain Mr. Haltom's agreement to certain restrictive covenants following his separation, including confidentiality, non-disparagement and non-solicitation provisions, as well as a release of potential claims, we entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Haltom. Pursuant to that agreement, Mr. Haltom received payments that represent his  base salary for one year and reimbursement for the cost of health insurance continuation for twelve months.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On April 4, 2018, Mr. Baxter was promoted to Group Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer and  Controller and his annual base salary was increased to $280,000 and his bonus target was increased to 50% of his base annual salary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On May 1, 2018, Mr. Grimes, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations  Officer, separated from the Corporation. In order to obtain Mr. Grimes' agreement to certain restrictive covenants following his separation, including confidentiality, non-disparagement and non-solicitation provisions, as well as a release of potential claims, we entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Grimes. Pursuant to that agreement, Mr. Grimes received a payment equal to one time  his base salary, a prorated annual bonus and reimbursement for the cost of health insurance continuation for twelve months.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On May 22, 2018, Mr. Alt was appointed as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief  Administrative Officer. In connection with his commencement of employment with us, Mr. Alt received certain sign-on benefits, including a cash sign-on bonus of  $250,000, an award of non-qualified stock options with a grant date value of approximately $462,000 and an award of restricted stock with a grant date value of approximately $938,000. The Compensation  Committee desired to offer Mr. Alt a competitive compensation package designed to encourage him to accept employment with us, which included one-time awards intended to address equity compensation granted  by his then-current employer that he would forfeit in connection with his termination of employment.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  The Compensation Committee reviews tally sheets in connection with making compensation decisions.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  We have a long-term incentive program that provides employees at the  Vice President level and above with a significant portion (1/3rd) of their equity-based compensation in the form of PBRSUs, which are subject to a three-year cliff-vesting provision and are payable if we meet sales growth and return on invested capital goals over the three-year  period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Minimum vesting requirements under our 2010 Omnibus Plan require that, subject to certain limited exceptions, full-value awards granted to employees either (i) be subject to a minimum vesting period of three years, or one year if the vesting is based on performance criteria, or (ii) be granted solely in exchange  for foregone compensation.

 Philosophy/Objectives of Executive Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee has developed the following set of objectives to guide the design of our executive officer compensation plans and practices, including those for our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers these objectives when making decisions regarding the forms, mix and amounts of compensation paid to our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals. To  assure that our compensation arrangements remain competitive with the compensation paid by other employers who compete with us for talent, the Compensation Committee considers peer group information as one input in its  decision-making process. In fiscal 2018, we targeted our compensation program to provide total direct compensation opportunities for our named executive officers at approximately the 25th percentile to median of our peer group. The Compensation Committee uses its judgment to vary executive officer pay within the targeted range and from the targeted range based on various  factors, such as an executive officers performance, responsibilities, experience and expected future contributions.      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of our executive officers more closely with those of our stockholders. The  compensation program for our executives is weighted toward performance-based compensation, with base salary generally being the only component of an executive officer's direct compensation that is fixed  each year. Other components, including annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation, are earned or derive value from the achievement of financial and strategic business objectives and/or increases in  stock price. The Compensation Committee believes this performance-driven compensation will promote our long-term success and lead to increased stockholder returns.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Manage risk by balancing the time horizon of incentive compensation. Our compensation program is balanced  between short- and long-term performance objectives, but always with a view to achieving long-term value for our stockholders.  This structure, together with our compensation recoupment policy, encourages and rewards sustained superior performance.  
[END TABLE]
We believe our compensation program provides a balanced and stable foundation for achieving our intended objectives. Our compensation philosophy emphasizes team effort, which we believe fosters rapid adjustment and adaptation to fast-changing market conditions and helps to not only achieve our short-term and long-term goals, but also aligns the interests of our management team with those of the Corporation and our stockholders. 
Internal Equity 
Internal equity is one factor of many that the Compensation Committee considers in establishing compensation for our executives. While there is no formal policy, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation levels to ensure that appropriate parity exists within the senior management team. The differences in compensation levels among our named executive officers reflect the significant variations in their relative responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer for management and oversight of a global enterprise are significantly higher than those of our other named executive officers. As a result, the pay level for our Chief Executive Officer is commensurately higher than the pay for other officer positions.  Management of Compensation-Related Risk 
We have designed our compensation programs to avoid excessive risk-taking. The following are some of the features of our program designed to help us appropriately manage business risk: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversification of incentive-related risk by employing a variety of  performance measures;  
[END TABLE]

• A balanced weighting of the various performance measures, to avoid excessive attention on achievement of one  measure over another;

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews each element of our executive compensation program, and the methods for determining the types and amounts of compensation, to assure that they help us meet our compensation philosophy and objectives. The Compensation Committee receives input from its independent compensation consultant as well as from members of management, as discussed below. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee retained the services of an independent consultant, FW Cook, to assist in its annual review of our management compensation levels and programs and bi-annual review of our non-employee director compensation levels and programs. As part of this engagement, FW Cook assisted the Compensation Committee in the design of our current compensation program for executives, and continues to advise the Compensation Committee on the program. The Compensation Committee has directly engaged FW Cook to assist with these same services for fiscal 2018, based on FW Cook's experience, expertise and familiarity with our company. FW Cook does not provide any services to our management, and does not provide any service to us, other than with respect to its role as the Compensation Committee's executive compensation consultant. 
Conflicts of Interest Assessment 
The Compensation Committee determined that the work of FW Cook did not raise any conflicts of interest in fiscal 2018. In making this assessment, the Compensation Committee considered the independence factors enumerated in Rule 10C-1(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the NYSE listing standards, including the fact that FW Cook does not provide any other services to the Corporation, the level of fees received from the Corporation as a percentage of FW Cook's total revenue, policies and procedures employed by FW Cook to prevent conflicts of interest, and whether the individual FW Cook advisers to the Compensation Committee own any stock of the Corporation or have any business or personal relationships with members of the Compensation Committee or our executive officers.  Market Data/Benchmarking 
FW Cook assisted the Compensation Committee in benchmarking our compensation arrangements and aggregate equity compensation practices against public companies similar in size and scope to our company. FW Cook obtained proxy data from the peer companies described below, as well as comparative compensation surveys of general industry companies. 
The following 16 specialty retail companies comprised our peer group for fiscal 2018, which we refer to as our "peer companies" or "peer group:" 
The Compensation Committee selected the companies in the peer group, after reviewing data on retail companies (including financial metrics, line-of-business, stock performance and employee count for each respective company) and considering several criteria, including the comparability of specialty retailers and the volatility and maturity of potential peers. In terms of size, our revenues and our market capitalization approximated the median of these peer companies. The peer group is unchanged from the peer group for fiscal 2017. 
Role of Management 
The Compensation Committee also considers the views and insights of our management, including our executive officers, in making compensation decisions. In particular, our Chief Executive Officer recommends to the Compensation Committee the base pay levels and individual compensation targets for each executive officer (other than himself) based on each executive's experience, as well as our Chief Executive Officer's view as to the strategic importance of that executive's role, knowledge and performance. Our Chief Executive Officer's unique insight into our business and day-to-day interaction with our senior executives provides a valuable resource to the Compensation Committee with respect to our executive compensation programs. In addition, the Compensation Committee relied on recommendations made by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer in selecting the performance metrics and targets for fiscal 2018 annual incentive compensation awards. 
Our Chief Executive Officer as well as other members of management generally attend Compensation Committee meetings to provide input on executive contributions, but no member of management participates in discussions with the Compensation Committee concerning his or her own compensation. The Compensation Committee also works closely with our internal legal, human resources, and finance personnel in establishing and monitoring our compensation programs. Our Chief Financial Officer provides the Compensation Committee with input on our financial performance and operational issues, and our General Counsel provides input to the Compensation Committee regarding compliance with the laws, regulations and best practices applicable to executive compensation. 
Experience of our Compensation Committee 
The Chair of our Compensation Committee has significant experience in the management of professionals and has served both as chair and as a member of the compensation committees of other publicly-traded companies, and all of our Compensation Committee members have significant experience with regard to the oversight of executive compensation practices of large publicly-traded companies. The Board believes that this experience provides the members of our Compensation Committee with a solid frame of reference within which to evaluate our executive compensation programs and practices.  Total Compensation Review 
As part of its process for determining the amount and mix of total compensation to be paid to our executive officers in fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed tally sheets prepared by management containing information for each executive officer regarding, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation for the last four fiscal years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• length of service with us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the types and amounts of long-term incentive awards granted in the  previous four fiscal years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the types and amounts of our equity securities, both vested and unvested, owned as of the end of the most  recently completed fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the proceeds realized from option exercises during the last four fiscal years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perquisites and other compensation paid in the previous fiscal year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the severance and other payments that he or she would receive upon the occurrence of certain events, taking into  account the proposed compensation to be paid to such executive officer for the new fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that this comprehensive annual review is important to an understanding of the total compensation paid and, in certain circumstances, payable to, our executive officers. The Compensation Committee uses these reports to test whether the various forms, targets, mix, and amounts of compensation paid and payable to our executive officers remain consistent with our compensation objectives. Based on its review for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee believes that the overall compensation of our executive officers was in line with the philosophy and objectives set forth above. 
The Compensation Committee strives to make decisions on each element of executive compensation within the context of an officer's entire compensation package, meaning that a decision on one pay element (such as base salary) impacts decisions made on other pay elements (such as annual and long-term incentives). Based upon input received from FW Cook, the Compensation Committee believes that this program balances both the mix of cash and equity compensation, the mix of currently-paid and longer-term compensation, and the security of severance and change-in-control benefits in a way that furthers the compensation objectives discussed above.  Compensation Components for Fiscal 2018 
The following are the principal elements of the fiscal 2018 compensation program for our executive officers, including our named executive officers, each of which are described in greater detail following the chart:

 Base Salary 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee determines the base salary for each of our named executive officers on an annual basis  (unless market conditions or changes in responsibilities merit mid-year changes) and targets base salaries at or near the 25th percentile to median of  the companies in our peer group. The Compensation Committee uses its judgment to vary executive officer pay within the targeted range and from the targeted range based on various factors, such as an executive officer's performance and  responsibilities.

[END TABLE]
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed market data provided by FW Cook on our peer companies and general industry to determine whether any significant changes to the base salaries for our executive officers were needed for fiscal 2018 to align our executive team with the market. The Compensation Committee increased the base salary levels of the named executive officers, with adjustments to reflect executive performance and to move executive salaries closer to the targeted competitive position as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Brickman's salary remained unchanged at $1,000,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Grimes's salary was increased modestly from $675,000 to $688,500;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Baxter's salary was originally increased from $250,000 to $254,000, with a subsequent increase on  April 4, 2018 to $280,000 in recognition of his promotion;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. McDermott's salary remained unchanged at $585,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Spinks' salary was modestly increased from $415,013 to $450,000;  
[END TABLE]

• Mr. Sherman's salary was increased from $296,154 to $360,000 in recognition of a promotion on  October 1, 2017; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Haltom's salary was increased from $450,000 to $500,000.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with his commencement of employment with us, the Compensation Committee approved an annual base salary for Mr. Alt of $600,000. In determining the base salaries for Mr. Alt, the Compensation Committee considered the market data of our peer companies and general industry market data, as well as the pay level of his predecessors and the base salary that he received from his prior employer. Mr. Alt was promoted to Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President — Sally Beauty Supply on October 19, 2018 upon the departure of Ms. McDermott. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the base salaries paid to our named executive officers during fiscal 2018 were appropriate to facilitate our ability to retain and motivate such officers and were competitive with those offered by our peer companies. For the base salaries paid to our named executive officers during fiscal 2018, please see the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 45 of this Proxy Statement. 
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus 
AIP.    For fiscal 2018, annual cash incentive bonuses for our named executive officers were made pursuant to the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the AIP, which   operates as a sub-plan of the 2010 Omnibus Plan. The AIP was designed to function as a "plan within a plan" in order to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, while giving the Compensation Committee the flexibility to tailor awards to reflect financial, operational and individual achievements based on subjective as well as objective criteria. The "outer layer" component of the AIP is entirely objective. No bonuses will be payable under the AIP unless we achieve positive operating income for the year, as reflected in our audited consolidated financial statements. If we achieve this threshold financial goal for the year, our Chief Executive Officer's maximum award is 1% of such operating income and each other named executive officer's maximum award is 0.5% of such operating income, which we refer to as the "Section 162(m) maximum awards." As the "inner layer" component of the AIP, at the beginning of each year the Compensation Committee establishes other financial, operational and/or individual performance goals for each executive officer that will be used to determine actual bonus amounts that are below the officer's Section 162(m) maximum award. The Compensation Committee in effect uses "negative discretion" to reduce the Section 162(m) maximum awards, as it deems appropriate, based on our financial performance relative to these pre-determined goals and based on the Compensation Committee's more subjective evaluation of financial, operational and individual performance. 
Award Opportunities.    Consistent with the above approach, the Compensation Committee established certain performance criteria for each named executive officer which, if satisfied, would enable him to earn a target-level (below maximum) award under the AIP for fiscal 2018 (we refer to these "inner layer" performance criteria as the AIP criteria). These AIP criteria are factors used by the Compensation Committee in exercising its discretion to appropriately size the AIP bonuses, if any, to an amount that is below the Section 162(m) maximum award amount, as described above. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our Chief Executive Officer made recommendations to the Compensation Committee as to the percentage of each named  executive officer's base salary (other than himself) to be used as his target-level award under the AIP, based on job responsibilities and peer group data provided by FW Cook. The Compensation Committee  made the      
[END TABLE]
The AIP is designed so that if we achieve the AIP financial performance targets and strategic initiatives (as discussed below), the executive is eligible to earn 100% of his or her target bonus award. Financial performance at below- target levels would result in awards as low as 0% of the target award, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee to make adjustments as described below. If we exceed the AIP financial performance targets, each named executive officer is eligible to earn an AIP bonus in an amount up to 200% of the financial criteria components of his or her target award and 150% of the strategic initiatives component, not to exceed the designated individual award limit. We refer to these higher amounts as the "AIP maximum awards," as distinguished from the Section 162(m) maximum awards. 
AIP Financial Performance Criteria.    In establishing the performance objectives for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the primary emphasis should be on financial performance objectives. Accordingly, in order for an executive to receive 100% of his or her AIP target bonus on financial metrics, the target level of financial performance must be achieved, subject to a potential adjustment based on individual performance, as described below.  For fiscal 2018, the AIP financial criteria consisted of the following three performance metrics, which were measured with reference to our annual operating plan. For shared services officers (Messrs. Brickman, Alt, Grimes, Baxter, Sherman and Haltom), these financial metrics were expressed on the consolidated level as made up by individual reporting units. For heads of a business unit (Mr. Spinks and Ms. McDermott), these financial metrics were expressed as that segment's portion of our annual operating plan. In addition a portion of Mr. Spinks and Ms. McDermott's AIP was tied to consolidated operating income of the Corporation. The percentage weighting of the various financial metrics represents the Compensation Committee's determination regarding the relative importance of each metric to our overall financial performance. The strategic initiatives focused on company-wide initiatives applied to all officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sales (20% for Messrs. Brickman, Alt, Grimes, Baxter, Sherman and Haltom and 12% for  Mr. Spinks and Ms. McDermott).  Sales, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions, measures our growth. It is a valuable measure in determining incentive compensation, as it provides consistency and  comparability in our financial reporting and therefore links the compensation of our executive officers with our growth objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted Operating Income (60% for Messrs. Brickman, Alt, Grimes, Baxter, Sherman and Haltom; 48% for  Mr. Spinks and Ms. McDermott segment portion; 20% for Mr. Spinks and Ms. McDermott consolidated level).  Adjusted Operating Income means the operating income of the Company as reported in the  Company's audited consolidated financial statements, with such adjustment as the Committee may provide for prior to the commencement thereof, or at such later time as may be permitted by applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (which  adjustments may include effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other unusual or non-recurring items, and the cumulative effect of tax or accounting changes, each  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements or management's discussion and analysis)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategic Initiatives (20%).  Company-wide initiatives applied to all officers set at the  beginning of fiscal year 2018 by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. These strategic initiatives focused on driving synergy in our European and South American businesses as well as setting key foundations for an  omni-channel experience.  
[END TABLE]
In setting the financial performance targets for the AIP, the Compensation Committee reviewed our financial projections for fiscal 2018 with Mr. Brickman. For fiscal 2018, the AIP financial performance targets were as follows:

 As noted above, if we achieve target-level financial performance, the executives are eligible to earn 100% of their target AIP bonus awards. Financial performance at below-target levels would result in awards as low as approximately 0% of the target award, except that, as discussed below, the Compensation Committee has discretion to reduce or increase the dollar value of an individual officer's AIP award based upon a subjective assessment of the individual's performance. The named executive officers were eligible to earn bonuses in excess of the target awards (up to the AIP maximum awards stated above) to the extent that performance against the financial goals exceeded target performance. AIP maximum awards could be earned if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we, or the applicable business unit, had achieved 100.1% or greater of the target amount of sales for fiscal  2018,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we had achieved 101.32% or greater of the target amount of adjusted Operating Income for fiscal 2018 or the  applicable business unit, had achieved 100.1% or greater of the target amount of adjusted Operating Income for fiscal 2018, and

• the leadership team exceeded the strategic initiatives  
[END TABLE]
When performance for a given financial metric exceeds target, the payout between target and maximum award opportunity for that metric is determined by straight-line interpolation. For example, based on the following sales chart, sales performance of 102.25% of target would translate into a payout percentage of 145%. If the sales component is weighted at 20% of the bonus opportunity, the weighted payout for that metric would equate to 29% of the total target bonus opportunity for that participant. Based on the following adjusted operating income chart (SBH Consolidated), adjusted operating income performance of 104.74% of target would translate into a payout percentage of 131%. If the adjusted operating income component is weighted at 60% of the bonus opportunity, the weighted payout for that metric would equate to 78.6% of the total target bonus opportunity for that participant.

Individual Performance.    In order to provide flexibility to recognize overall achievements in key focus areas and operational performance, which can change throughout the year based on unanticipated contingencies, the Compensation Committee does not list specific individual performance objectives for individual officers under the AIP. Instead, the Compensation Committee has the ability to use its qualitative judgment to reduce or increase the dollar value of an individual officer's AIP award (by up to 50 percentage points below or above the percentage of the target award resulting from application of the financial performance formulas) based upon a subjective assessment of the individual's performance, but the adjusted payout cannot exceed the Section 162(m) maximum award for such individual. 
Determination of Fiscal 2018 Awards.    The amounts by which the financial performance targets under the AIP were achieved for each metric, the strategic initiatives achievement and the resulting payout factors, are illustrated in the following table.

Equity-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In November 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the long-term incentive program for fiscal 2018, pursuant to which employees at the Vice President level and above received 33% of their fiscal 2018 equity-based compensation in the form of TBRSAs, 33% in the form of PBRSUs and the remaining portion in the form of time-based stock options (34%). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The TBRSAs create strong retention for our executives because the benefits of such awards are dependent on the  continued success of the company and long-term stock price appreciation. In addition, the awards vest ratably over a three-year period, requiring our executives to remain employed for a significant period in  order to realize any value for their TBRSAs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The PBRSUs are eligible to vest following the conclusion of a three-year  performance period based on the level of achievement of goals related to adjusted operating income growth (weighted at 60%) and return on invested capital (ROIC) (weighted at 40%), over such three-year period.  Each of these performance metrics is an indicator of our growth and profitability, thereby aligning the interests of senior management with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Compensation  Committee established threshold, target and maximum performance levels for both sales growth and ROIC, where achievement at the threshold, target and maximum performance level results in 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of the PBRSUs becoming  vested.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options create a strong financial incentive for meeting or exceeding our  long-term financial goals and increasing stockholder return because the benefits of such awards are dependent on the appreciation of the price of our Common Stock. In addition, the options vest ratably over a three-year period, requiring our executives to remain employed for a significant period in order to realize any value for their options.  
[END TABLE]
 Grant Practices for Equity-Based Awards.    The Compensation Committee's policy is to grant equity awards on the same day it approves the grant. Options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of grant. Other than special one-time grants, such as at the time of a new hire or promotion, the Compensation Committee intends to grant equity awards to its executive officers once a year, and such grants will generally be made at the same time that the Compensation Committee approves the annual bonus award targets under the annual bonus plan for the fiscal year. These actions will generally occur within the first month of the fiscal year. Equity grants are currently made under the 2010 Omnibus Plan. 
Our Vice President of Compensation and Benefits recommends to our Chief Executive Officer the number of options or other equity awards to be granted to certain key employees based on consideration of each individual's rate of base salary and the dollar value of the proposed award as a percentage of base salary and market value. Our Chief Executive Officer then makes a grant recommendation for each of the proposed grantees, including the named executive officers other than himself, to the Compensation Committee based on consideration of the value of the grants that the individual received in prior years, the competitive market data provided by FW Cook and his views as to the individual's expected future contribution to our business results. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors recommends to the Compensation Committee the Chief Executive Officer's proposed equity grant based on his review of competitive market data provided by FW Cook. The Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible for determining the number of options or shares to be awarded and for approving each grant. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer, the long-term incentive opportunity market data provided by FW Cook, and the competitive data provided by FW Cook regarding aggregate share usage and costs associated with equity grants. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee sets an aggregate long-term incentive budget to  determine the total amount of equity awards that may be awarded in any fiscal year. The Compensation Committee determines the budget after discussions with FW Cook and management and a review of      
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018 Equity Awards.    Consistent with its equity grant policy, in November 2017, the Compensation Committee granted stock options, TBRSAs and PBRSUs to each of Messrs. Brickman, Grimes, Spinks, Sherman, Baxter and Haltom and Ms. McDermott, with stock options comprising 1/3rd of the grant value, TBRSAs comprising 1/3rd of the grant value, and PBRSUs comprising 1/3rd of the grant value. In addition to these regular grants, the Compensation Committee approved the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an award of non-qualified stock options with a grant date value of  approximately $462,000 and an award of restricted stock with a grant date value of approximately $938,000 in connection with Mr. Alt's commencement of employment. The stock option award vests ratably over four years and the restricted  stock award vests ratably over three years, in each case subject to Mr. Alt's continued employment with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
For more information regarding the equity-based awards granted to our named executive officers during fiscal 2018, please see the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2018" table on page 48 of this Proxy Statement.  Determination of Fiscal 2016-2018 PBRSUs 
The PBRSUs granted in October 2015 for the fiscal year 2016-2018 performance period were determine to have vested at 52.2% of the targeted award for Messrs. Spinks, and Sherman. The sales growth metric did not reach a threshold level of performance and no payout was earned for the sales growth metric worth 40% of the award. The return on invested capital metric performed at 22.24% vs. target of 22.5% over the three-year period resulting in an 87% payout to target for 60% of the award. Overall the award vested at 52.2% of target and the remainder PBRSUs were cancelled per the terms of the award. Awards for Mr. Brickman earned at 0% on both sales and return on invested capital metrics as Mr. Brickman's awards were tied to a pre-tax reform fixed tax rate in the return on invested capital metric calculation.

 Benefits and Perquisites.    Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the  benefit plans generally available to all of our U.S. employees, which include health, dental, life insurance, and disability plans. In addition, our named executive officers (along with our other U.S. employees) are eligible to participate in our  401(k) plan, which represents the only retirement plan that we provide to our named executive officers. Under the 401(k) plan, our employees may contribute, on a pre-tax basis, up to 50% of eligible  compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. We match each employee's contribution, including our named executive officers, at a rate of 100% on the first 4% of the employee's eligible compensation. Employees are immediately  vested in the matching contributions made by us.

 Consistent with our philosophy of emphasizing performance-based pay,  our executive compensation program provides limited benefits and perquisites. All perquisites for executive officers must be approved by the Compensation Committee.   
 The Compensation Committee believes that offering the  above-described benefits and perquisites to our named executive officers is consistent with the terms and benefits offered by other similarly-situated public companies,  and enhances our ability to retain our named executive officers. Given the fact that these items represent a relatively insignificant portion of our named executive officers' total compensation, the availability of such items does not  materially influence the decisions made by the Compensation Committee with respect to the other elements of the total compensation payable to our named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Post-Termination Benefits 
Change-in-Control Agreements.    Many change-in-control transactions result in significant organizational changes, particularly at the senior executive level. In order to encourage our senior executive officers to remain employed with the Corporation during an important time when their prospects for continued employment can be uncertain, during fiscal year 2018, we were parties to change-in-control agreements with each of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Baxter), which provide payments and benefits in the event of the executive's termination of employment by the Corporation without cause or by the executive for "good reason" within two years following a change in control. Because a termination by the executive for good reason is effectively a "constructive termination" by the Corporation without cause, we believe it is appropriate to provide severance benefits in these circumstances. The Compensation Committee has determined that our change-in-control agreements were generally   consistent with those in place at similarly-situated public companies, were designed to keep our executives focused on their work responsibilities during the uncertainty that accompanies a potential change-in-control, and (consistent with the recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer) were necessary to retain and recruit our senior executives. The Compensation Committee also deemed it important from a retention perspective to treat all of the named executive officers (other than Mr. Baxter) similarly with respect to their change-in-control arrangements. 
Treatment of Equity Awards upon Change in Control.    Under the terms of our Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2007 Omnibus Plan") and our 2010 Omnibus Plan, stock option and restricted stock awards have "double trigger" change-in-control vesting if the awards are assumed by the surviving company and equitably converted to awards for publicly traded stock in connection with such transaction. This means that the awards would vest upon the holder's involuntary separation from service within two years following the change in control, or such other period specified by the Compensation Committee. If the awards are not assumed by the surviving company and equitably converted, they would vest upon the change in control. In addition, upon a change in control, PBRSUs will be cancelled in exchange for an amount equal to the change in control price multiplied by the target number of PBRSUs granted. This vesting approach aids in our ability to retain key executives during the critical time leading up to and following a change in control. 
Separation Agreement with Mr. Grimes and Mr. Haltom.    As discussed earlier, Mr. Grimes and Mr. Haltom received certain separation benefits in connection with their resignations from Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer of the Corporation and Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation, respectively, in order to obtain their agreements to certain restrictive covenants following their resignations, including confidentiality, non-disparagement and non-solicitation provisions, as well as a release of potential claims. In determining the appropriate severance amounts for Mr. Grimes and Mr. Haltom, the Compensation Committee considered the severance payable to comparable executives and also considered the fact that Mr. Grimes and Mr. Haltom would forfeit a substantial number of previously-granted equity awards in connection with their resignations. 
Compensation Recoupment Policy 
The Corporation has adopted a compensation recoupment policy that complies with and goes beyond the parameters described in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, in the event that we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the U.S. securities laws, we will seek to recover from any current or former executive officer incentive-based compensation (including equity compensation) received during the three-year period preceding the date on which the accounting restatement was required to be made. The amount to be recovered is the excess of the amount paid calculated by reference to the erroneous data, over the amount that would have been paid to the executive officer calculated using the corrected accounting statement data. This compensation recovery would be applied regardless of whether the executive officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the restatement. 
In addition to the above-described recoupment specified by the Dodd-Frank Act, our policy also requires the Corporation, to the extent permitted by governing law, to seek reimbursement of non-equity incentive compensation paid to any current or former employee after January 1, 2011, where: A) (i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of specified financial results; (ii) such financial results were subsequently the subject of a restatement or other material adjustment, (iii) in the Compensation Committee's view the person engaged in misconduct that caused or contributed to the need for the restatement or material adjustment, and (iv) a lower payment would have been made to the person based upon the correct financial results; or B) such employee commits an act of embezzlement, fraud or theft with respect to the property of the Corporation. In each such instance, the Corporation will seek to recover   the person's entire non-equity incentive compensation payment (not just the excess amount earned based on erroneous data) paid during the 12-month period preceding the Compensation Committee's determination that the person engaged in misconduct. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
Consistent with our commitment to aligning the interests of our executives with stockholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines which apply to our officers at the Vice President level and above. Pursuant to these guidelines, officers are encouraged to own shares of our Common Stock generally equal in value to a multiple of their annual base salary (as in effect on December 1st of each year) depending on such executive's level in the Corporation. 
The amended guidelines provide that shares owned outright by the officer or indirectly (e.g., owned or held in trust by an immediate family member), vested but unexercised stock options, shares the receipt of which has been deferred, as well as shares held in company sponsored benefit or retirement plans, count towards the grantee's stock ownership totals, with each option counting as one share of stock owned. 
Unvested stock options, restricted shares (stock for which restrictions have not lapsed), restricted stock units which have not been settled, as well as unearned PBRSUs, do not count as stock owned under the guidelines. The officer stock ownership guidelines, as applicable to the named executive officers, are as follows: 
Until such time as the officer reaches his or her equity ownership guideline, the officer will be required to retain that percentage of the shares of Common Stock received upon vesting of restricted stock, settlement of restricted stock units and exercise of stock options (net of any shares utilized to pay for the exercise price of the option and/or tax withholding for the option, restricted stock or restricted stock units, as applicable) as set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Retention Requirement        
 Chief Executive Officer      100%  
 Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents      50%  
 Group Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents      50%  
[END TABLE]
Because officers must retain a percentage of shares resulting from any exercise of stock options, settlement of restricted stock units or the vesting of restricted stock until they achieve the specified guidelines, there is no minimum time period required to achieve the equity ownership guidelines set forth above. As of September 30, 2018, all of our executive officers were in compliance with our equity ownership guidelines. 
The Compensation Committee may in the future consider an executive's achievement of the guideline stock ownership targets in its award of further equity grants. 
Beginning in fiscal year 2013, we instituted stock ownership and retention guidelines for our independent directors, as further described on page 22 of this Proxy Statement. 
Use of Pre-Approved Trading Plans 
We permit our executive officers and Directors to enter into pre-approved trading plans established according to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with an independent broker-dealer to enable them to either a) purchase securities; or b) to recognize the value of their compensation and diversify their holdings of our securities during periods in which they might otherwise   not be able to buy or sell our stock because important information about us had not been publicly released. These plans include specific instructions for the broker to exercise options or purchase or sell stock on behalf of the plan participant if our stock price reaches a specified level or certain events occur. The plan participant no longer controls the decision to purchase, exercise or sell the securities in the plan. Generally, when our executive officers trade under these plans they are publicly disclosed in Section 16 filings with the SEC. One of our named executive officers (Mr. Haltom, who separated from the Company on January 24, 2018) had Rule 10b5-1 sale plans in place during fiscal 2018. 
Policy Against Margin Trading, Pledging or Hedging Company Stock 
Certain forms of margin trading, pledging, hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, allow a director, officer or other employee to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. These transactions allow the person to continue to own the covered securities but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, he or she may no longer have the same objectives as the Corporation's other stockholders. Therefore, pursuant to our published insider trading policy, our directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions. 
Deductibility of Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility for federal income tax purposes of compensation paid to our named executive officers (other than our Chief Financial Officer). Under Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of these officers in excess of $1,000,000 per year is deductible by us only if it is "performance-based." The Compensation Committee believes that tax deductibility of compensation is an important consideration in establishing our executives' compensation. For example, the 2010 Omnibus Plan is designed to allow the Compensation Committee to grant awards that may qualify for the performance-based compensation exemption from Section 162(m), such as stock options and PBRSUs, and the AIP, as a sub plan of the 2010 Omnibus Plan, also allows annual cash incentive awards that may qualify as performance-based compensation. A number of requirements must be met for particular compensation to so qualify, however, so there can be no assurance that any compensation awarded will be fully deductible under all circumstances. Also, with the goal of providing a compensation program that enhances stockholder value, the Compensation Committee reserves flexibility to approve compensation arrangements that are not fully tax deductible by us. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been replaced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
Consideration of Most Recent Advisory Stockholder Vote on Executive Compensation 
At the annual meeting of stockholders on January 26, 2017, our stockholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year. In accordance with the results of this vote, the Board determined to implement an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next required vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of executives. Therefore, the last advisory vote was held in 2018 and the next advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at this annual meeting. Please refer to "Proposal 2 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation" on page 71 for information regarding the advisory (non-binding) resolution regarding the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
At the annual meeting of stockholders on February 1, 2018, in the advisory vote on executive compensation, over 96% of the shares voted were voted in support of the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers. The Compensation Committee appreciates and values the views   of our stockholders. As part of its compensation review, the Compensation Committee considered both the results of the 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation and feedback from our stockholders, and concluded that the compensation paid to our executive officers and the Corporation's overall executive pay practices have strong stockholder support and have been effective in implementing the Corporation's stated compensation philosophy and objectives. The Compensation Committee recognizes that executive pay practices and notions of sound governance principles continue to evolve. Consequently, the Compensation Committee intends to continue paying close attention to the advice and counsel of its compensation advisors and invites our stockholders to communicate any concerns or opinions on executive pay directly to the Compensation Committee or the Board. Please refer to "Stockholder — Director Communications" on page 14 for information about communicating with the Board.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K included in this Proxy Statement. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

 Code Section 280G Cut-Back 
Pursuant to the terms of the severance agreements, any payments to the executive under such agreements will be reduced so that the present value of such payments plus any other "parachute payments" as determined under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code will not, in the aggregate, exceed 2.99 times the executive's average taxable income from us over the five-year period ending prior to the year in which a change in control occurs. However, no such reduction will apply to payments that do not constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Equity Awards 
2010 Omnibus Plan 
Pursuant to the 2010 Omnibus Plan, in the event of a change in control, as defined below, the Compensation Committee may determine that all outstanding awards will be honored or assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by the surviving company; provided that any substitute award must (i) be based on shares of common stock that are traded on an established U.S. securities market; (ii) provide the participant substantially equivalent or more favorable terms and conditions than those applicable to the old award; (iii) have substantially equivalent economic value to the old award (determined at the time of the change in control); and (iv) provide that in the event that the participant is involuntarily terminated within two years after the change in control, or such other period specified by the Compensation Committee, the award will vest. 
If the Compensation Committee does not provide for substitute awards as described above or make another determination with respect to the treatment of awards, then, upon the occurrence of a change in control: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will become exercisable immediately before the change in  control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all time-based vesting restrictions on restricted stock and restricted  stock units will lapse immediately before the change in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares of common stock underlying awards of restricted stock units and deferred stock units (other than  performance awards) will be issued immediately before the change in control; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with respect to performance awards, the performance period will end as of the change in control and the  participant will earn a pro rata payout equal to the product of the target opportunity and the payout percentage that corresponds as closely as possible to the actual level of achievement of performance goals against target, measured as of the date  of the change in control(1); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at the Compensation Committee's discretion, each award will be canceled in exchange for an amount equal to a  value determined in accordance with the 2010 Omnibus Plan, based on the change in control price.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the 2010 Omnibus Plan, the term "change in control" generally means the first to occur of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any person, other than us, our subsidiaries, our employee benefit plans, or a certain  designated fund or its affiliates, of 50% or more of the voting power of our outstanding Common Stock;

• a change in the majority of our incumbent directors within any 24 month period;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• due to the grantee's retirement (as defined in the 2010 Omnibus Plan), and unless the grantee agrees to  certain restricted covenants described below, (i) any options that are exercisable as of the date of retirement will remain exercisable until the earlier of 12 months and the expiration of the option term, (ii) any unvested options  will be forfeited and cancelled as of the date of the termination, and (iii) any outstanding shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards will be forfeited and cancelled as of the date of such termination; or

[END TABLE]
The 2010 Omnibus Plan contain certain restrictive covenants, including non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure and non-disparagement covenants, that apply to the holder of an option during the term of his or her employment, any post-termination exercise period, and the one-year period following the expiration of any post-termination exercise period. If an option holder violates any of these covenants, then any options, to the extent unexercised, will automatically terminate and be cancelled upon the first date of the violation and, in the case of the termination of the grantee's employment for "cause," he or she will remit to us in cash, to the extent applicable, the excess of (A) the greater of the closing price for shares of our Common Stock on (i) the date of exercise and (ii) the date of sale of the shares of Common Stock underlying the options, over (B) the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the options (without reduction for any shares of Common Stock surrendered or attested to) the grantee realized from exercising all or a portion of the options within the period commencing six months prior to the termination of his or her employment and ending on the one-year date. This provision does not apply to the restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards made under the 2010 Omnibus Plan. 
In addition, the 2010 Omnibus Plan provide that, in the event that the grantee's service with us is terminated as a result of the grantee's retirement (as defined in the 2010 Omnibus Plan) and the grantee agrees to be bound for a three-year period by certain restrictive covenants, including non-competition, non-solicitation,non-disclosure and non-disparagement covenants, then (i) the payout opportunities   attainable under all of the grantee's outstanding performance-based awards will vest based on actual performance through the end of the performance period, and the awards will payout on a pro-rata basis, based on the time elapsed prior to the date of retirement, and (ii) for the three-year period following the grantee's retirement, (ii) the grantee's outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units will continue to vest, and (iii) the grantee will continue to vest in the portion of the options that were not vested and exercisable as of the date of his or her retirement, as if the grantee's service had not terminated. If the grantee violates any of the restrictive covenants during the three-year period, all outstanding options (whether or not vested) and all unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards then held by the grantee will be immediately forfeited and cancelled as of the date of such violation. 
Potential Realization Value of Equity Awards upon a Change in Control without Termination 
Under the 2010 Omnibus Plan, in the event of a change in control, the vesting of outstanding awards may be accelerated regardless of whether the award holder's employment is terminated in connection therewith. The following table shows the potential realizable value of outstanding awards granted to our named executive officers pursuant to the 2010 Omnibus Plan, assuming that:

CEO Pay Ratio 
The CEO pay ratio figures below are a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
We determined that the Corporation had 29,730 employees as of July 1, 2018. 
To determine our median employee, we used W-2 "gross pay" as our consistently applied compensation measure. We then annualized gross pay for permanent employees who commenced work during fiscal year 2018 and any employees who were on leave for a portion of fiscal year 2018. 
Using this methodology, we identified the median employee and that person's total annual compensation was $15,720. The total annual compensation of our CEO was $4,662,468. Accordingly, the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay was 297:1.

Securities Owned by Directors, Executive Officers and Certain Beneficial Owners 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership, as of November 14, 2018, of: (i) our Common Stock by each person believed by us (based upon their Schedule 13D or 13G filings with the SEC), to beneficially own more than 5% of the total number of outstanding shares; and (ii) our Common Stock by each current director (including director nominees) or executive officer and of all the current directors (including director nominees) and executive officers as a group. The number of shares beneficially owned by each person or group as of November 14, 2018, includes shares of Common Stock that such person or group had the right to acquire on or within 60 days after November 14, 2018, including upon the exercise of options. The total number of outstanding shares on which the percentages of share ownership in the table are based is 120,208,755. All such information is estimated and subject to change. Each outstanding share of Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Except as specified below, the business address of the persons listed is our headquarters, 3001 Colorado Boulevard, Denton, Texas 76210. 
Ownership of our Common Stock is shown in terms of "beneficial ownership." Amounts and percentages of Common Stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or "investment power," which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which he has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. More than one person may be considered to beneficially own the same shares. In the table below, unless otherwise noted, a person has sole voting and dispositive power for those shares shown as beneficially owned by such person.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and certain persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock and other security interests of Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. Directors, executive officers, and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by the regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we believe that all of our directors and officers complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during fiscal 2018.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee serves an independent oversight role by consulting with and providing guidance to management and the Corporation's independent auditors on matters such as accounting, audits, compliance, controls, disclosure, finance and risk management. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that all Audit Committee members are "independent" (within the meaning of the applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC) and financially literate. The Board of Directors has designated Robert R. McMaster, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, along with Marshall E. Eisenberg, John A. Miller, David W. Gibbs, and Denise Paulonis as audit committee financial experts under the SEC's guidelines. 
The Audit Committee's purposes and responsibilities are described in its charter, available on the corporate governance section of the Corporation's website at http://investor.sallybeautyholdings.com and in print, without charge, upon written request to our Vice President of Investor Relations. They include (a) assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of the integrity of the Corporation's financial statements and financial reporting processes, overseeing compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, reviewing the independent auditors' qualifications and independence (including auditor rotation), and reviewing the performance of the Corporation's internal audit function; (b) deciding whether to appoint, retain or terminate the Corporation's independent auditors and to pre-approve all audit, audit-related, tax and other services, if any, to be provided by the independent auditors; and (c) preparing this report. The Audit Committee members do not act as accountants or auditors for the Corporation. Management is responsible for the Corporation's financial statements and the financial reporting process, including the implementation and maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The independent auditors have free access to the Audit Committee to discuss any matters they deem appropriate. 
The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Corporation's independent auditor, both in fact and appearance. Consistent with its charter, the Audit Committee has evaluated the qualifications, performance, and independence of KPMG LLP, the Corporation's independent auditors, including that of KPMG LLP's lead audit partner. As part of its auditor engagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has established in its charter a policy pursuant to which all services, audit and non-audit, provided by the independent auditor must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its designee. The Corporation's pre-approval policy is more fully described in this Proxy Statement under the caption "Proposal 4 — Ratification of Selection of Auditors." The Audit Committee has concluded that provision of the non-audit services described in that section is compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG LLP. In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed, with management and the independent auditors, the Corporation's audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence from the Corporation and its management. The Audit Committee has considered whether the independent auditors' provision of non-audit services to the Corporation is compatible with the auditors' independence.  Following the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 PROPOSAL 2 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, the Corporation is providing in this Proxy Statement a separate resolution, subject to an advisory (non-binding) vote, to approve the compensation of its named executive officers. This proposal is commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" proposal. As required by these rules, the Board invites you to review carefully the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 23 and the tabular and other disclosures on compensation under Executive Compensation beginning on page 45, and cast a vote "FOR" the Corporation's executive compensation programs through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Corporation's named executive officers, including the Corporation's compensation practices and principles and their implementation, as discussed and disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any narrative executive compensation disclosure contained in this Proxy Statement." 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 23, the Board of Directors believes that the Corporation's long-term success depends in large measure on the talents of our employees. The Corporation's compensation system plays a significant role in our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the highest quality workforce. The Board believes that its current compensation program directly links executive compensation to performance, aligning the interests of the Corporation's executive officers with those of its stockholders. 
This vote is advisory and will not be binding on the Corporation. While the vote does not bind the Board to any particular action, the Board values the input of the stockholders, and will take into account the outcome of this vote in considering future compensation arrangements. 
At the 2018 annual meeting, our stockholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year. In accordance with the results of this vote, the Board determined to implement an advisory "Say on Pay" vote every year until the next required vote on the frequency of "Say on Pay" vote. 
Although this vote is advisory in nature and does not impose any action on the Corporation or the Compensation Committee of the Board, the Corporation strongly encourages all stockholders to vote on this matter. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 2.  EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION

 PROPOSAL 3 — APPROVAL OF THE SALLY BEAUTY HOLDINGS, INC. 
2019 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
On November 2, 2018, our Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting, the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2019 Omnibus Plan"). The 2019 Omnibus Plan will become effective as of the date it is approved by our stockholders. 
The 2019 Omnibus Plan is intended to serve as the successor to the Sally Beauty Holdings Amended and Restate 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan"). As of December 6, 2018, there were approximately 7,106,148 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan. As of such date, there were approximately 3,537,180 shares of our common stock reserved and available for future awards under the Prior Plan. The Prior Plan has been the sole source of shares for all equity incentive awards granted to our officers, employees and directors since 2010, and during such time we have never sought stockholder approval of any increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the Prior Plan. If our stockholders approve the 2019 Omnibus Plan, all future equity awards will be made from the 2019 Omnibus Plan, and we will not grant any additional awards under the Prior Plan. 
A summary of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is set forth below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2019 Omnibus Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A. 
Promotion of Sound Corporate Governance Practices 
We have designed the 2019 Omnibus Plan to include a number of features that reinforce and promote alignment of equity compensation arrangements for employees, officers and non-employee directors with the interests of stockholders and the company. These features include, but are not limited to, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Discounted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs). Stock options and SARs may not be granted  with exercise prices lower than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prohibition on Repricing. The exercise price of a stock option or SAR may not be reduced, directly or  indirectly, without the prior approval of stockholders, including by a cash repurchase of "underwater" awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimum Vesting Requirements. Subject to certain limited exceptions, awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus  Plan will either (i) be subject to a minimum vesting period of one year, or (ii) be granted solely in exchange for foregone cash compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Share Recycling. Shares retained by or delivered to the company to pay the exercise price of a  stock option or SAR or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise or settlement of an award count against the number of shares remaining available under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Dividends on Unearned Awards. The 2019 Omnibus Plan prohibits the current payment of dividends or  dividend equivalent rights on unearned awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards Subject to Clawback Policy. Awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be subject to any compensation  recoupment policy that the company may adopt from time to time.  
[END TABLE]

Summary of the 2019 Omnibus Plan 
Purpose. The purpose of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is to promote the interests of the company and its stockholders by strengthening the ability of the company to attract, motivate, reward, and retain qualified individuals upon whose judgment, initiative, and efforts the financial success and growth of the business of the company largely depend, and to provide an opportunity for such individuals to acquire stock ownership and other rights that promote and recognize the financial success and growth of the company. 
Administration. The 2019 Omnibus Plan will be administered by a committee (the "Committee") of the Board. The Committee will have the authority to designate participants; determine the type or types of awards to be granted to each participant and the number, terms and conditions thereof; establish, adopt or revise any rules and regulations as it may deem advisable to administer the 2019 Omnibus Plan; interpret the terms and intent of the 2019 Omnibus Plan and any award certificate; and make all other decisions and determinations that may be required under the 2019 Omnibus Plan. Unless and until changed by the Board, the Compensation Committee is designated as the Committee to administer the 2019 Omnibus Plan. 
Eligibility. The 2019 Omnibus Plan permits the grant of incentive awards to employees, officers, non-employee directors, and consultants of the company and its affiliates as selected by the Committee. As of December 6, 2018, approximately 30,000 employees and eleven non-employee directors would be eligible to participate in the 2019 Omnibus Plan. 
Awards to Non-Employee Directors. Notwithstanding the above, awards to non-employee directors will be made only in accordance with the terms, conditions and parameters of a plan, program or policy for the compensation of non-employee directors as in effect from time to time. The Committee may not make discretionary grants under the 2019 Omnibus Plan to non-employee directors outside of such established program for director compensation. 
Permissible Awards. The 2019 Omnibus Plan authorizes the granting of awards in any of the following forms: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• market-priced stock options to purchase shares of our common stock (for a term not to exceed 10 years), which may  be designated under the Code as nonstatutory stock options (which may be  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     granted to all participants) or incentive stock options (which may be granted to officers and employees but not to consultants or non-employee directors);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SARs, which give the holder the right to receive the difference (payable in cash or stock, as specified in the  award certificate) between the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of exercise over the base price of the award (which cannot be less than the fair market value of the underlying stock as of the grant date);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock awards (including performance shares), which are subject to restrictions on transferability and  subject to forfeiture on terms set by the Committee, including time-based and/or performance-based vesting conditions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs (including performance units), which represent the right to receive shares of common stock (or an equivalent  value in cash, as specified in the award certificate) at a designated time in the future, subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting conditions set by the Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• non-employee director awards, including DSUs, which represent a vested  right to receive shares of common stock at a designated time in the future;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other stock-based awards that are denominated in, or valued by reference to, shares of our common stock; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• cash-based awards, including performance-based annual bonus awards.  
[END TABLE]
Shares Available for Awards. Subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits and similar events, the aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan is 8,000,000, plus a number of additional shares (7,106,148) underlying awards outstanding as of the effective date of the 2019 Omnibus Plan under the Prior Plan that thereafter terminate or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited or lapse for any reason. 
Share Counting. Shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan shall be counted against the 2019 Omnibus Plan reserve as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full number of shares subject to a stock option shall count against the shares remaining available under the  2019 Omnibus Plan, even if the exercise price of the stock option is satisfied in whole or in part through net-settlement or by delivering shares to the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full number of shares originally subject to an award of SARs shall count against the shares remaining  available under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares withheld or repurchased from an award to satisfy tax withholding requirements shall count against the  shares remaining available under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, and shares delivered to satisfy tax withholding requirements shall not be added to the 2019 Omnibus Plan share reserve.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To the extent an award granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan is canceled, terminates, expires, is forfeited or  lapses for any reason, including by reason of failure to achieve maximum performance goals, any unissued or forfeited shares will be added back to the 2019 Omnibus Plan share reserve and again be available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares subject to awards settled in cash will be added back to the 2019 Omnibus Plan share reserve and again be  available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee may grant awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan in substitution for awards held by employees of  another entity who become employees of the company as a result of a business combination, and such substitute awards will not count against the 2019 Omnibus Plan share reserve.  
[END TABLE]
Limitations on Individual Awards. The maximum number of shares of common stock subject to stock-based awards that may be granted (or allocated in the case of multi-year performance awards) under the 2019   Omnibus Plan is 8,000,000 and the aggregate compensation that may be granted or awarded to any Non-Employee Director in respect of his or her services as a Non-Employee Director, including all meeting fees, cash retainers and retainers granted in the form of Awards, shall not exceed $400,000, or $650,000 in the case of a non-employee Chairman of the Board or Lead Director. For purposes of such limit, the value of Awards will be determined based on the aggregate Grant Date fair value of all awards issued to the director in such year (computed in accordance with applicable financial accounting rules). 
Minimum Vesting Requirements. Except in the case of substitute awards granted in a business combination as described above, awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will either (i) be subject to a minimum vesting period of one year, or (ii) be granted solely in exchange for foregone cash compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may (i) permit acceleration of vesting of full-value awards in the event of a participant's termination of service, or (ii) grant awards without the minimum vesting requirements described above with respect to awards covering 5% or fewer of the total number of shares authorized under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  
Treatment of Awards upon a Participant's Termination of Service. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant's service terminates by reason of death or disability: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all of such participant's outstanding options and stock appreciation rights that would have vested on the  next vesting date after such termination of service will become vested and remain exercisable for a period of one year or until the earlier expiration of the original term of the option or stock appreciation right;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the time-based vesting restrictions with respect to that participant's restricted stock or restricted stock  units that would have lapsed on the next vesting date after such termination of service will lapse as of the date of termination of service; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payout opportunities attainable under all of that participant's outstanding performance-based awards  will vest based on actual performance through the end of the performance period, and the awards will payout on a pro-rata basis, based on the time elapsed prior to the date of termination.   
[END TABLE]
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant's service terminates by reason of retirement and the participant agrees to be bound by and continues to comply with certain restrictive covenants during a three-year period following retirement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such participant's outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will continue to vest in accordance  with their respective terms during the three-year period as if the participant's service had not terminated and such awards may be exercised until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the participant's retirement, (or if the  participant dies prior to such third anniversary, 12 months after the participant's death), and (ii) the expiration of the original term of the option or stock appreciation right;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all time-based vesting restrictions with respect to that participant's restricted stock or restricted stock  units will continue to lapse in accordance with their respective terms during such three-year period as if the participant's service had not terminated; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payout opportunities attainable under all of that participant's outstanding performance-based awards  will vest based on actual performance through the end of the performance period, and the awards will payout on a pro-rata basis, based on the time elapsed prior to the date of retirement.   
[END TABLE]
If the retiring participant elects not to be bound by the restrictive covenants, then: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such participant's outstanding options and stock appreciation rights that were vested as of the date of  retirement may be exercised until the earlier of the first anniversary of the participant's retirement or the expiration of the original term of the option or stock appreciation right, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any awards held by the participant (including options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted  stock units and performance awards) that were not vested as of the date of retirement will be forfeited.  
[END TABLE]
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant's service is terminated for cause (or if, following the date of termination for any reason, the Committee determines that circumstances exist such that the participant's service could have been terminated for cause), any awards held by that participant, whether or not then exercisable, will be immediately forfeited as of the date of such termination. 
Treatment of Awards upon a Change in Control. In connection with a change in control of the Corporation (as defined in the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the Committee may determine that all outstanding awards will be honored or assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by the surviving company; provided that any substitute award must (i) be based on shares of common stock that are traded on an established U.S. securities market; (ii) provide the participant substantially equivalent or more favorable terms and conditions than those applicable to the old award; (iii) have substantially equivalent economic value to the old award (determined at the time of the change in control); and (iv) provide that in the event that the participant is involuntarily terminated within two years after the change in control, or such other period specified by the Committee, the award will vest. 
If the Committee does not provide for substitute awards as describe above or make another determination with respect to the treatment of awards, then, upon the occurrence of a change in control: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will become exercisable immediately before the change in  control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all time-based vesting restrictions on restricted stock and restricted stock units will lapse immediately before  the change in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares of common stock underlying awards of restricted stock units and deferred stock units (other than  performance awards) will be issued immediately before the change in control; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with respect to performance awards, the performance period will end as of the change in control and the  participant will earn a pro rata payout equal to the product of the target opportunity and the payout percentage that corresponds as closely as possible to the actual level of achievement of performance goals against target, measured as of the date  of the change in control; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at the Committee's discretion, each award will be canceled in exchange for an amount equal to a value  determined in accordance with the 2019 Omnibus Plan, based on the change in control price.  
[END TABLE]
Limitations on Transfer; Beneficiaries. A participant may not assign or transfer an award other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that the Committee may permit other transfers (other than transfers for value). A participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any award upon the participant's death. 
Adjustments. In the event of a transaction between the company and its stockholders that causes the per-share value of the company's common stock to change (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering, or large nonrecurring cash dividend), the share authorization limits under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be adjusted proportionately, and the Committee must make such adjustments to the 2019 Omnibus Plan and awards as it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights immediately resulting from such transaction. In the event of any corporate event or transaction involving the company, such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, a stock dividend, spin-off, or a combination or exchange of shares, dividend in kind or other like change in capital structure, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such other appropriate adjustments to the terms of any outstanding awards to reflect such changes or distributions and to modify any other terms of outstanding awards.  Termination and Amendment. The Board may, at any time and from time to time, terminate or amend the 2019 Omnibus Plan, but if an amendment would constitute a material amendment requiring stockholder approval under applicable listing requirements, laws, policies or regulations, then such amendment will be subject to stockholder approval. No termination or amendment of the 2019 Omnibus Plan may, without the written consent of the participant, reduce or diminish the value of an outstanding award. Unless sooner terminated, the 2019 Omnibus Plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its adoption by the Board or, if the stockholders approve an amendment to the 2019 Omnibus Plan that increases the number of shares subject to the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the tenth anniversary of the date of such approval. 
The Committee may amend or terminate outstanding awards. However, such amendments may require the consent of the participant and, unless approved by the stockholders, the exercise price of an outstanding option may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, and the original term of an option may not be extended. 
Prohibition on Repricing. As indicated above under "Termination and Amendment," outstanding stock options and SARs cannot be repriced, directly or indirectly, without stockholder approval. The exchange of an "underwater" stock option or SAR (i.e., an award having an exercise price in excess of the current market value of the underlying stock) for another award or for a cash payment would be considered an indirect repricing and would, therefore, require stockholder approval. 
Clawback Policy. Awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be subject to any compensation recoupment policy (sometimes referred to as a "clawback policy") of the company as adopted from time to time. 
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Effects 
The U.S. federal income tax discussion set forth below is intended for general information only and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential tax effects of the 2019 Omnibus Plan. It is based upon laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. State and local income tax consequences are not discussed, and may vary from locality to locality. 
Nonstatutory Stock Options. There will be no federal income tax consequences to the optionee or to the company upon the grant of a nonstatutory stock option under the 2019 Omnibus Plan. When the optionee exercises a nonstatutory option, however, he or she will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock received upon exercise of the option at the time of exercise over the exercise price, and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction. Any gain that the optionee realizes when he or she later sells or disposes of the option shares will be short-term or long-term capital gain, depending on how long the shares were held. 
Incentive Stock Options. There will be no federal income tax consequences to the optionee or to the company upon the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. If the optionee holds the option shares for the required holding period of at least two years after the date the option was granted and one year after exercise, the difference between the exercise price and the amount realized upon sale or disposition of the option shares will be long-term capital gain or loss, and the company will not be entitled to a federal income tax deduction. If the optionee disposes of the option shares in a sale, exchange, or other disqualifying disposition before the required holding period ends, he or she will recognize taxable ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the option shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price, and the company will be allowed a federal income tax deduction equal to such amount. While the exercise of an incentive stock option does not result in current taxable income, the excess of the fair market value of the option shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price will be an item of adjustment for purposes of determining the optionee's alternative minimum taxable income.  SARs. A participant receiving a SAR under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will not recognize income, and the company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time the award is granted. When the participant exercises the SAR, the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares of stock received will be ordinary income to the participant and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time. 
Restricted Stock. Unless a participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of the income to the date of grant as described below, a participant will not recognize income, and the company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a restricted stock award is granted, provided that the award is nontransferable and is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. When the restrictions lapse, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock as of that date (less any amount he or she paid for the stock), and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m). If the participant files an election under Code Section 83(b) within 30 days after the date of grant of the restricted stock, he or she will recognize ordinary income as of the date of grant equal to the fair market value of the stock as of that date (less any amount paid for the stock), and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m). Any future appreciation in the stock will be taxable to the participant at capital gains rates. However, if the stock is later forfeited, the participant will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant to the Code Section 83(b) election. 
Restricted or Deferred Stock Units. A participant will not recognize income, and the company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a stock unit award is granted. Upon receipt of shares of stock (or the equivalent value in cash) in settlement of a stock unit award, a participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock or other property as of that date (less any amount he or she paid for the stock or property), and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m). 
Cash-Based Awards. A participant will not recognize income, and the company will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a cash-based award is granted (for example, when the performance goals are established). Upon receipt of cash in settlement of the award, a participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the cash received, and the company will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time, subject to any applicable limitations under Code Section 162(m). 
Tax Withholding. The company has the right to deduct or withhold, or require a participant to remit to the company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including employment taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the 2019 Omnibus Plan. 
Benefits to Named Executive Officers and Others 
As of December 6, 2018, no awards had been granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan. Awards will be made at the discretion of the Committee or pursuant to delegated authority. Therefore, it is not presently possible to determine the benefits or amounts that will be received by such persons or groups pursuant to the 2019 Omnibus Plan in the future.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL 3.  PROPOSAL 4 — RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUDITORS 
Based upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors has selected KPMG LLP, which we refer to as KPMG, to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending September 30, 2018.

(3)  The Audit Committee pre-approved all fees.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by KPMG and determined that the provision of these services during fiscal 2018 is compatible with maintaining KPMG's independence. 
Pre-Approval Policy.    Our Audit Committee (or its designee, as described below) approved all audit and permissible non-audit fees during fiscal year 2018. The Audit Committee has the sole and direct authority to engage, appoint and replace our independent auditors. In addition, the Audit Committee has established an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy, whereby every engagement of KPMG to perform audit or permissible non-audit services on behalf of us or any of our subsidiaries requires pre-approval from the Audit Committee or its designee before KPMG is engaged to provide those services. Pursuant to that policy, we expect that on an annual basis, the Audit Committee will review and provide pre-approval for certain types of services that may be rendered by the independent auditors, together with a budget for the applicable fiscal year. The pre-approval policy also requires the pre-approval of any fees that are in excess of the amount budgeted by the Audit Committee. The pre-approval policy contains a provision delegating limited pre-approval authority to the chairman of the Audit Committee in instances when pre-approval is needed prior to a scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The chairman of the Audit Committee would be required to report on such pre-approvals at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. As a result, the Audit Committee or its designee has approved 100% of all services performed by KPMG on behalf of us or any of our subsidiaries subsequent to November 16, 2006, the date we became a public company. 
If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of KPMG, the selection of independent auditors will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Board may reserve to itself any or all of the authority and responsibility of the Committee under the Plan or may act as administrator of the Plan for any and all purposes.

To the extent any action of the Board under the Plan conflicts with actions taken by the Committee, the actions of the Board shall control. 
4.2    ACTION AND INTERPRETATIONS BY THE COMMITTEE.    For purposes of administering the Plan, the Committee may from time to time adopt rules, regulations, guidelines and procedures for carrying out the provisions and purposes of the Plan and make such other determinations, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may deem appropriate. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award in the manner and to the extent it deems necessary to carry out the intent of the Plan. The Committee's interpretation of the Plan, any Awards granted under the Plan, any Award Certificate and all decisions and determinations by the Committee with respect to the Plan are final, binding, and conclusive on all parties. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Company or any Affiliate, the Company's or an Affiliate's independent certified public accountants, Company counsel or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company or the Committee to assist in the administration of the Plan. No member of the Committee will be liable for any good faith determination, act or omission in connection with the Plan or any Award.

4.4    DELEGATION.    The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more officers of the Company or an Affiliate or to one or more agents or advisors such administrative duties or powers as it may deem advisable, and the Committee or any individuals to whom it has delegated duties or powers as aforesaid may employ one or more individuals to render advice with respect to any responsibility the Committee or such individuals may have under this Plan. In addition, the Committee may, by resolution, expressly delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more officers of the Company, the authority, within specified parameters as to the number and terms of Awards, to (i) designate officers and/or employees of the Company or any of its Affiliates to be recipients of Awards under the Plan, and (ii) to determine the number of such Awards to be received by any such Participants; provided, however, that such delegation of duties and responsibilities may not be made with respect to the grant of Awards to eligible participants who are subject to Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act at the Grant Date.

Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Committee, or the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with this Article 4, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his or her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled under the Company's charter or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
ARTICLE 5

(a)    To the extent that an Award is canceled, terminates, expires, is forfeited or lapses for any reason (including by reason of failure to achieve maximum performance goals), any unissued or forfeited Shares subject to the Award will be added back to the Plan share reserve and again be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan. 
(b)    Shares subject to Awards settled in cash will be added back to the Plan share reserve and again be available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan. 
(c)    Shares withheld from an Award to satisfy tax withholding requirements will count against the number of Shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan, and Shares delivered by a participant to satisfy tax withholding requirements will not be added to the Plan share reserve. 
(d)    The full number of Shares subject to an Option shall count against the number of Shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan, even if the exercise price of an Option is satisfied through net-settlement or by delivering Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or attestation). 
(e)    The full number of Shares subject to a stock-settled SAR shall count against the number of Shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to Awards made under the Plan (rather than the net number of Shares actually delivered upon exercise). 
(f)    Substitute Awards granted pursuant to Section 13.11 of the Plan shall not count against the Shares otherwise available for issuance under the Plan under Section 5.1. 
(g)    Subject to applicable Exchange requirements, shares available under a stockholder-approved plan of a company acquired by the Company (as appropriately adjusted to Shares to reflect the transaction) may be issued under the Plan pursuant to Awards granted to individuals who were not directors or employees of the Company or its Affiliates immediately before such transaction and will not count against the maximum share limitation specified in Section 5.1. 
5.3    STOCK DISTRIBUTED.    Any Stock distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Stock, treasury Stock or Stock purchased on the open market. 
5.4    LIMITATION ON AWARDS.    Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary (but subject to adjustment as provided in Article 14), during the term of the Plan, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be 8,000,000. 
5.5    LIMITATION ON COMPENSATION FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.    With respect to any one calendar year, the aggregate compensation that may be granted or awarded to any one Non-Employee Director in respect of his or her services as a Non-Employee Director, including all meeting fees, cash retainers and retainers granted in the form of Awards, shall not exceed $400,000, or $650,000 in the case of a non-employee Chairman of the Board or Lead Director. For purposes of such limit, the value of Awards will be determined based on the aggregate Grant Date fair value of all awards issued to the director in such year (computed in accordance with applicable financial accounting rules). 
ARTICLE 6 
ELIGIBILITY 
6.1    GENERAL.    Awards may be granted only to Eligible Participants. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Eligible Participants who are employees of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary as defined in 
A-8 
 Section 424(e) and (f) of the Code. Eligible Participants who are service providers to an Affiliate may be granted Options or SARs under this Plan only if the Affiliate qualifies as an "eligible issuer of service recipient stock" within the meaning of §1.409A- 1(b)(5)(iii)(E) of the final regulations under Code Section 409A. 
ARTICLE 7 
STOCK OPTIONS 
7.1    GENERAL.    The Committee is authorized to grant Options to Participants on the following terms and conditions: 
(a)    Exercise Price.    The exercise price per Share under an Option shall be determined by the Committee, provided that the exercise price for any Option (other than an Option issued as a substitute Award pursuant to Section 13.11) shall not be less than the Fair Market Value as of the Grant Date. 
(b)    Prohibition on Repricing.    Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.1 or in connection with a Change in Control, without the prior approval of stockholders of the Company: (i) the exercise price of an Option may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, (ii) an Option may not be cancelled in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or SARs with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise price of the original Option, and (iii) the Company may not repurchase an Option for value (in cash or otherwise) from a Participant if the current Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Option is lower than the exercise price per share of the Option. 
(c)    Time and Conditions of Exercise.    The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to Sections 7.1(e) and 13.6, and may include in the Award Certificate a provision that an Option that is otherwise exercisable and has an exercise price that is less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the last day of its term will be automatically exercised on such final date of the term by means of a "net exercise," thus entitling the optionee to Shares equal to the intrinsic value of the Option on such exercise date, less the number of Shares required for tax withholding. The Committee shall also determine the performance or other conditions, if any, that must be satisfied before all or part of an Option may be exercised or vested. 
(d)    Payment.    The Committee shall determine the methods by which the exercise price of an Option may be paid, the form of payment, and the methods by which Shares shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants. As determined by the Committee at or after the Grant Date, payment of the exercise price of an Option may be made, in whole or in part, in the form of (i) cash or cash equivalents, (ii) delivery (by either actual delivery or attestation) of previously-acquired Shares based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date the Option is exercised, (iii) withholding of Shares from the Option based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date the Option is exercised, (iv) broker-assisted market sales, or (iv) any other "cashless exercise" arrangement. 
(e)    Exercise Term.    Except for Nonstatutory Options granted to Participants outside the United States, no Option granted under the Plan shall be exercisable for more than ten years from the Grant Date. 
(f)    No Deferral Feature.    No Option shall provide for any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the exercise or disposition of the Option. 
(g)    No Dividend Equivalents.    No Option shall provide for Dividend Equivalents. 
7.2    INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.    The terms of any Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan must comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Without limiting the foregoing, any Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who at the Grant Date owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company must have an exercise price per Share of not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date and an Option term of not more than five years. If all of the requirements of Section 422 of the Code (including the above) are not met, the Option shall automatically become a Nonstatutory Stock Option.

(1)    The Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise; over 
(2)    The base price of the SAR as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Certificate, which for any SAR (other than a SAR issued as a substitute Award pursuant to Section 13.11) shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of one Share on the Grant Date. 
(b)    Prohibition on Repricing.    Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.1 or in connection with a Change in Control, without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company, (i) the base price of a SAR may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, (ii) a SAR may not be cancelled in exchange for cash, other Awards, or Options or SARs with an exercise or base price that is less than the base price of the original SAR, and (iii) the Company may not repurchase a SAR for value (in cash or otherwise) from a Participant if the current Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the SAR is lower than the base price per share of the SAR. 
(c)    Time and Conditions of Exercise.    The Committee shall determine the time or times at which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to Section 13.6, and may include in the Award Certificate a provision that a SAR that is otherwise exercisable and has a base price that is less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the last day of its term will be automatically exercised on such final date of the term, thus entitling the holder to cash or Shares equal to the intrinsic value of the SAR on such exercise date, less the cash or number of Shares required for tax withholding. No SAR shall be exercisable for more than ten years from the Grant Date. 
(d)    No Deferral Feature.    No SAR shall provide for any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the exercise or disposition of the SAR.

RESTRICTED STOCK AND STOCK UNITS 
9.1    GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND STOCK UNITS.    The Committee is authorized to make Awards of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units to Participants in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee. An Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Certificate setting forth the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to the Award. 
9.2    ISSUANCE AND RESTRICTIONS.    Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions on transferability and other restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, for example, limitations on the right to vote Restricted Stock or the right to receive dividends on the Restricted Stock). These restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances, in such installments, upon the satisfaction of performance goals or otherwise, as the Committee 
A-10 
 determines, subject to Section 13.6, at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Certificate or any special Plan document governing an Award, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units until such time as Shares of Stock are paid in settlement of such Awards. 
9.3    DIVIDENDS ON RESTRICTED STOCK.    Dividends accrued on shares of Restricted Stock before they are vested shall be credited by the Company to an account for the Participant and accumulated without interest until the date upon which the host Award becomes vested, and any dividends accrued with respect to forfeited Restricted Stock will be reconveyed to the Company without further consideration or any act or action by the Participant. In no event shall dividends be paid or distributed until the vesting restrictions of the underlying Restricted Stock Award lapse. 
9.4    FORFEITURE.    Subject to the terms of the Award Certificate and except as otherwise determined by the Committee at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, upon termination of Continuous Service during the applicable restriction period or upon failure to satisfy a performance goal during the applicable restriction period, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that are at that time subject to restrictions shall be forfeited. 
9.5    DELIVERY OF RESTRICTED STOCK.    Shares of Restricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant at the Grant Date either by book-entry registration or by delivering to the Participant, or a custodian or escrow agent (including, without limitation, the Company or one or more of its employees) designated by the Committee, a stock certificate or certificates registered in the name of the Participant. If physical certificates representing shares of Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the Participant, such certificates must bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. 
ARTICLE 10 
PERFORMANCE AWARDS 
10.1    GRANT OF PERFORMANCE AWARDS.    The Committee is authorized to grant any Award under this Plan, including cash-based Awards, with performance-based vesting criteria, on such terms and conditions as may be selected by the Committee. Any such Awards with performance- based vesting criteria are referred to herein as Performance Awards. The Committee shall have the complete discretion to determine the number of Performance Awards granted to each Participant and to designate the provisions of such Performance Awards as provided in Section 4.3. All Performance Awards shall be evidenced by an Award Certificate or a written program established by the Committee, pursuant to which Performance Awards are awarded under the Plan under uniform terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in such written program. 
10.2    PERFORMANCE GOALS.    The Committee may establish performance goals for Performance Awards which may be based on any criteria selected by the Committee. Performance goals may be described in terms of Company-wide objectives or in terms of objectives that relate to the performance of the Participant, an Affiliate or a division, region, department or function within the Company or an Affiliate. Performance goals may be specified in absolute terms, in percentages, or in terms of growth from period to period or growth rates over time, as well as measured relative to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or a published or special index, or a stock market index, that the Committee deems appropriate. Performance Goals need not be based upon an increase or positive result under a business criterion and could include, for example, the maintenance of the status quo or the limitation of economic losses (measured, in each case, by reference to a specific business criterion). If the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the Company or the manner in which the Company or an Affiliate conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render performance goals to be unsuitable, the Committee may modify such performance goals in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate. 
A-11 
ARTICLE 11 
DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS 
11.1    GRANT OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS.    The Committee is authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents with respect to Full-Value Awards granted hereunder. Dividend Equivalents shall entitle the Participant to receive payments equal to ordinary cash dividends or distributions with respect to all or a portion of the number of Shares subject to a Full-Value Award, as determined by the Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Dividend Equivalents accruing on unvested Full-Value Awards shall, as provided in the Award Certificate, either (i) be reinvested in the form of additional Shares (subject to Share availability under Section 5.1 hereof), which shall be subject to the same vesting provisions as provided for the host Award, or (ii) be credited by the Company to an account for the Participant and accumulated without interest until the date upon which the host Award becomes vested, and, in either case, any Dividend Equivalents accrued with respect to forfeited Awards will be reconveyed to the Company without further consideration or any act or action by the Participant. In no event shall Dividend Equivalents be paid or distributed until the vesting restrictions of the underlying Full-Value Award lapse. 
ARTICLE 12 
STOCK OR OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS 
12.1    GRANT OF STOCK OR OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS.    The Committee is authorized, subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Participants such other Awards that are payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to Shares, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan, including without limitation, convertible or exchangeable debt securities, other rights convertible or exchangeable into Shares, including limited partnership interests in a limited partnership entity of which the Company is general partner that may be exchanged or redeemed for Shares on a one-for-one basis, or any profits interest in such limited partnership entity that may be exchanged or converted into such limited partnership interests, and Awards valued by reference to book value of Shares or the value of securities of or the performance of specified Parents or Subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards with such Awards being subject to the provisions of Article 11. 
ARTICLE 13

13.2    FORM OF PAYMENT FOR AWARDS.    At the discretion of the Committee, payment of Awards may be made in cash, Stock, a combination of cash and Stock, or any other form of property as the Committee shall determine. In addition, payment of Awards may include such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the Committee deems appropriate, including, in the case of Awards paid in the form of Stock, restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions. Further, payment of Awards may be made in the form of a lump sum, or in installments, as determined by the Committee. 
13.3    LIMITS ON TRANSFER. 
(a)    Each Award and each right under any Award shall be exercisable only by the holder thereof during such holder's lifetime, or, if permissible under applicable law, by such holder's guardian or legal representative or by a transferee receiving such Award pursuant to a domestic relations order (a "QDRO") as defined in Section 414(p)(1)(B) of the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or the rules thereunder. 
A-12 
(b)    No Award (prior to the time, if applicable, Shares are delivered in respect of such Award), and no right under any Award, may be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a grantee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution (or in the case of Restricted Stock, to the Company) or pursuant to a QDRO, and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate; provided that the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the grantee's death shall not constitute an assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer or encumbrance. 
(c)    Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) above, to the extent provided in the Award Certificate, Awards (other than Incentive Stock Options and corresponding Awards), may be transferred, without consideration, to a Permitted Transferee. For this purpose, a "Permitted Transferee" in respect of any grantee means any member of the Immediate Family of such grantee, any trust of which all of the primary beneficiaries are such grantee or members of his or her Immediate Family, or any partnership (including limited liability companies and similar entities) of which all of the partners or members are such grantee or members of his or her Immediate Family; and the "Immediate Family" of a grantee means the grantee's spouse, any person sharing the grantee's household (other than a tenant or employee), children, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, siblings, grandparents, nieces and nephews. Such Award may be exercised by such transferee in accordance with the terms of the Award Certificate. 
(d)    Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Company or any Affiliate to honor a QDRO except to the extent required under applicable law. 
13.4    BENEFICIARIES.    Notwithstanding Section 13.3, a Participant may, in the manner determined by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the Participant's death. A Permitted Transferee, beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award Certificate applicable to the Participant, except to the extent the Plan and Award Certificate otherwise provide, and to any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the Participant, any payment due to the Participant shall be made to the Participant's estate. Subject to the foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Participant, in the manner provided by the Company, at any time provided the change or revocation is filed with the Committee. 
13.5    STOCK TRADING RESTRICTIONS.    All Stock issuable under the Plan is subject to any stop- transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal or state securities laws, rules and regulations and the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock is listed, quoted, or traded. The Committee may place legends on any Stock certificate or issue instructions to the transfer agent to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock. 
13.6    MINIMUM VESTING REQUIREMENTS. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, Awards granted under the Plan (other than cash-based Awards) shall vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the Award is granted; provided, that the following Awards shall not be subject to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement: any (i) substitute Awards granted pursuant to Section 13.11, (ii) Shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash Awards, (iii) Awards to Non-Employee Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, and (iv) any additional Awards the Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 5.1 (subject to adjustment under Section 14.1); and, provided, further, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any Award, including in cases of Retirement, death, Disability or a Change in Control, in the terms of the Award Certificate or otherwise. 
A-13 
13.7    SEPARATION FROM SERVICE.     
(a)    Death or Disability. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at or after the Grant Date, if a Participant's separates from service by reason of such Participant's death or Disability: 
(i)    the portion of that Participant's Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that would have become vested and exercisable on the next vesting date after the date of such Participant's termination shall become immediately exercisable in full and the Award as so vested may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary or legal representative) until the earlier of (i) the twelve-month anniversary of the date of such separation from service, and (ii) the expiration of the term of such Award, and any additional portion of such Award that is not then exercisable shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such separation from service; 
(ii)    the time-based vesting restrictions with respect to any Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units then held by such Participant that would have lapsed on the next vesting date after the date of such Participant's separation from service shall lapse as of the date of such separation from service, and the unvested portion of each such Award shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such separation from service; and 
(iii)    the Participant or, as the case may be, the Participant's estate, shall retain a portion of his Performance Awards equal to the number of shares or units underlying each Award multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the commencement of the applicable Performance Period through the date of the Participant's separation from service, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Performance Period (each a "Retained Award"), and the remainder of each Award shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such separation from service. The Retained Award shall vest upon completion of the applicable Performance Period to the extent that applicable performance objectives are attained. 
(b)    Retirement. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at or after the Grant Date, if a Participant separates from service by reason of such Participant's Retirement, then 
(i)    if the Participant agrees to be bound by certain restrictive covenants, including non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure and non-disparagement covenants as determined in the sole discretion of the Company, during the three-year period following the Participant's Retirement: 
(1)    such Participant's unvested Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall continue to become exercisable in accordance with their respective terms during such three-year period as if such Participant's employment or other service had not terminated, and all of such Participant's exercisable Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (including those that become exercisable pursuant to the immediately preceding clause) may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant's beneficiary or legal representative) until the earlier of (A)(i) the third anniversary of the Participant's Retirement or (ii) if the Participant dies prior to the third anniversary of the Participant's Retirement, the twelve-month anniversary following the date of the Participant's death, and (B) the expiration of the term of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. Upon the expiration of such period, all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights not previously exercised by the Participant shall be forfeited and canceled; 
(2)    any time-based vesting restrictions with respect to such Participant's Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall continue to lapse in accordance with their respective terms during such three-year period as if such Participant's employment or other service had not terminated; 
(3)    such Participant shall retain a portion of his Performance Awards equal to the number of shares or units underlying each Performance Award multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the commencement of the applicable Performance Period through the date of his Retirement, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Performance Period (each a "Retained Retirement Award"), and the remainder of each Award shall be forfeited and 
A-14 
 canceled as of the date of such Retirement. Subject to the Participant's compliance with such covenants, the Retained Retirement Awards shall vest upon completion of the applicable Performance Period for such Retained Retirement Award to the extent that applicable performance objectives are attained; and 
(4)    if (A) the Participant violates any such restrictive covenants during the applicable three-year period, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, or (B) following the date of the Participant's Retirement, circumstances exist such that the Participant's employment or other service could have been terminated for Cause, in each case, then, as of the date of such violation, (1) all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted to such Participant, whether or not then exercisable, shall be immediately forfeited and canceled, (2) all unvested time-based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant shall be immediately forfeited and canceled, and (3) all unvested Performance Awards shall be immediately forfeited and canceled. 
(ii)    if the Retiring Participant elects not to be bound by the restrictive covenants described in subsection (a) above, then 
(1)    any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights held by the Participant that are exercisable as of the date of Retirement may be exercised until the earlier of (A) the twelve-month anniversary of the date of Retirement, and (B) the expiration of the term of such Award, and any additional portion of such Award that is not then exercisable shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such Retirement; 
(2)    any unvested Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such Retirement; and 
(3)    any unvested Performance Awards held by the Participant shall be forfeited and canceled as of the date of such Retirement. 
(c)    For Cause. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at or after the Grant Date, if a Participant's employment or other service is terminated by the Company or any Subsidiary for Cause (or if, following the date of termination of the Participant's service for any reason, the Committee determines that circumstances exist such that the Participant's service could have been terminated for Cause), any Awards granted to such Participant, whether or not then exercisable in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, shall be immediately forfeited and canceled as of the date of such termination. 
13.8    EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN CONTROL. 
(a)    Accelerated Vesting and Payment. 
(i)    Time-Based Awards. Unless the Committee otherwise determines in the manner set forth in Section 13.8(b), in the event of a Change in Control (1) all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to such Change in Control, (2) the time-based vesting restrictions on all Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall lapse immediately prior to such Change of Control, (3) shares of Common Stock underlying Awards of Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units (other than Performance Awards) shall be issued immediately prior to such Change in Control to each Participant then holding such Award, or (4) at the discretion of the Committee (as constituted immediately prior to the Change in Control), each such Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Unit and Deferred Stock Unit shall be canceled in exchange for an amount equal to the product of (A)(I) in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the excess, if any, of the product of the Change in Control Price over the exercise price for such Award, and (II) in the case of Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units (other than Performance Awards), the Change in Control Price, multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Award. 
(ii)    Performance Awards. Unless the Committee otherwise determines at or after the Grant Date of a Performance Award, in the event of a Change in Control, (1) any Performance Period in progress at the time 
A-15 
 of the Change in Control for which the Performance Award is outstanding shall end effective upon the occurrence of such Change in Control, (2) the Participant shall be deemed to have earned a pro rata payout (the "Pro Rata Amount") equal to the product of (A) such Participant's target award opportunity with respect to such Award for the Performance Period in question and (B) the payout percentage as indicated in the Award that corresponds as closely as possible to the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target, measured as of the date of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee (as constituted immediately prior to the Change in Control), and (3) the portion of the Performance Award in excess of the Pro Rata Amount shall be forfeited and canceled as of the effective time of such Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the discretion of the Committee (as constituted immediately prior to the Change in Control), all Performance Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control shall be canceled upon the Change in Control in exchange for an amount equal to the product of (A) the Change in Control Price, multiplied by (B) the aggregate earned number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Performance Award. 
(iii)    Timing of Payments. Payment of any amounts calculated in accordance with Sections 13.8(a)(i) and 13.8(a)(ii) shall be payable in full, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 30 days, following the Change in Control, subject to Section     . 
(b)    Assumed Awards. Notwithstanding Section 13.8(a), no cancellation, termination, acceleration of exercisability or vesting, lapse of any restrictions or settlement or other payment shall occur with respect to any outstanding Award (other than a Performance Award), if the Committee (as constituted immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction constituting the Change in Control) reasonably determines, in good faith, prior to the Change in Control that such outstanding Awards shall be assumed by the surviving entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection with a Change in Control (such assumed, converted or substituted Award being hereinafter referred to as an "Assumed Award"), provided that any Assumed Award must: 
(i)    be based on shares of common stock that are traded on an established U.S. securities market; 
(ii)    provide the Participant (or each Participant in a class of Participants) with rights and entitlements substantially equivalent to or more favorable to the Participant than the rights, terms and conditions applicable under such Award, including, but not limited to, an identical or more favorable exercise or vesting schedule and identical or more favorable timing and methods of payment; 
(iii)    have substantially equivalent economic value to such Award (determined at the time of the Change in Control); and 
(iv)    have terms and conditions which provide that in the event that the Participant suffers an involuntary separation from service from the surviving entity within two years following the Change in Control, or such other period specified by the Committee, any conditions on the Participant's rights under, or any restrictions on transfer or exercisability applicable to, each such Award held by such Participant shall be waived or shall lapse, as the case may be, upon such separation from service. 
13.9    DISCRETION TO ACCELERATE AWARDS.    Regardless of whether an event has occurred as described in Section 13.7 or 13.8 above, the Committee may in its sole discretion determine that, upon the termination of service of a Participant for any reason, or the occurrence of a Change in Control, or any other reason, all or a portion of such Participant's Options or SARs shall become fully or partially exercisable, that all or a part of the restrictions on all or a portion of the Participant's outstanding Awards shall lapse, and/or that any performance-based criteria with respect to any Awards held by that Participant shall be deemed to be wholly or partially satisfied, in each case, as of such date as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, declare. The Committee's determination in exercising its discretion pursuant to this Section 13.9 need not be uniform and may be different for different Participants whether or not such Participants are similarly situated. 
A-16 
13.10    FORFEITURE EVENTS.    Awards under the Plan shall be subject to any compensation recoupment policy that the Committee may adopt from time to time that is applicable by its terms to the Participant. In addition, the Committee may specify in an Award Certificate that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, (i) termination of employment for cause, (ii) violation of material Company or Affiliate policies, (iii) breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, (iv) other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or any Affiliate, or (v) a later determination that the vesting of, or amount realized from, a Performance Award was based on materially inaccurate financial statements or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria, whether or not the Participant caused or contributed to such material inaccuracy. Nothing contained herein or in any Award Certificate prohibits the Participant from: (1) reporting possible violations of federal law or regulations, including any possible securities laws violations, to any governmental agency or entity; (2) making any other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulations; or (3) otherwise fully participating in any federal whistleblower programs, including but not limited to any such programs managed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange. 
13.11    SUBSTITUTE AWARDS.    The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for stock and stock-based awards held by employees of another entity who become employees of the Company or an Affiliate as a result of a merger or consolidation of the former employing entity with the Company or an Affiliate or the acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate of property or stock of the former employing corporation. The Committee may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances. 
ARTICLE 14 
CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
14.1    MANDATORY ADJUSTMENTS.    In the event of a nonreciprocal transaction between the Company and its stockholders that causes the per-share value of the Stock to change (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering, or large nonrecurring cash dividend), the authorization limits under Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall be adjusted proportionately, and the Committee shall make such adjustments to the Plan and Awards as it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights immediately resulting from such transaction. Action by the Committee may include: (i) adjustment of the number and kind of shares that may be delivered under the Plan; (ii) adjustment of the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) adjustment of the exercise price of outstanding Awards or the measure to be used to determine the amount of the benefit payable on an Award; (iv) adjustment to the performance objectives applicable to outstanding awards; and (v) any other adjustments that the Committee determines to be equitable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not make any adjustments to outstanding Options or SARs that would constitute a modification or substitution of the stock right under Treas. Reg. Sections 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v) that would be treated as the grant of a new stock right or change in the form of payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of a subdivision of the outstanding Stock (stock-split), a declaration of a dividend payable in Shares, or a combination or consolidation of the outstanding Stock into a lesser number of Shares, the authorization limits under Section 5.1 and 5.4 shall automatically be adjusted proportionately, and the Shares then subject to each Award shall automatically, without the necessity for any additional action by the Committee, be adjusted proportionately without any change in the aggregate purchase price therefor. 
14.2    DISCRETIONARY ADJUSTMENTS.    Upon the occurrence or in anticipation of any corporate event or transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any merger, reorganization, recapitalization, combination or exchange of shares, or any transaction described in Section 14.1), the Committee 
A-17 
 may, in its sole discretion, provide (i) that Awards will be settled in cash rather than Stock, (ii) that Awards will become immediately vested and non-forfeitable and exercisable (in whole or in part) and will expire after a designated period of time to the extent not then exercised, (iii) that Awards will be assumed by another party to a transaction or otherwise be equitably converted or substituted in connection with such transaction, (iv) that outstanding Awards may be settled by payment in cash or cash equivalents equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the underlying Stock, as of a specified date associated with the transaction, over the exercise or base price of the Award, (v) that performance targets and performance periods for Performance Awards will be modified, or (vi) any combination of the foregoing. The Committee's determination need not be uniform and may be different for different Participants whether or not such Participants are similarly situated. 
14.3    GENERAL.    Any discretionary adjustments made pursuant to this Article 14 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 15.2. To the extent that any adjustments made pursuant to this Article 14 cause Incentive Stock Options to cease to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, such Options shall be deemed to be Nonstatutory Stock Options. 
ARTICLE 15 
AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION 
15.1     AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION.    The Board or the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, amend, modify or terminate the Plan without stockholder approval; provided, however, that if an amendment to the Plan would, in the reasonable opinion of the Board or the Committee, either (i) materially increase the number of Shares available under the Plan (other than pursuant to Article 14), (ii) expand the types of awards under the Plan.(iii)    materially expand the class of participants eligible to participate in the Plan, (iv) materially extend the term of the Plan, or (v) otherwise constitute a material change requiring stockholder approval under applicable laws, policies or regulations or the applicable listing or other requirements of an Exchange, then such amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval; and provided, further, that the Board or Committee may condition any other amendment or modification on the approval of stockholders of the Company for any reason, including by reason of such approval being necessary or deemed advisable (i) to comply with the listing or other requirements of an Exchange, or (ii) to satisfy any other tax, securities or other applicable laws, policies or regulations. Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.1 or in connection with a Change in Control, without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company, the Plan may not be amended to permit: (i) the exercise price or base price of an Option or SAR to be reduced, directly or indirectly, (ii) an Option or SAR to be cancelled in exchange for cash, other Awards, or Options or SARs with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise price or base price of the original Option or SAR, or (iii) the Company to repurchase an Option or SAR for value (in cash or otherwise) from a Participant if the current Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Option or SAR is lower than the exercise price or base price per share of the Option or SAR. 
15.2    AWARDS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED.    At any time and from time to time, the Committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award without approval of the Participant; provided, however: 
(a)    Subject to the terms of the applicable Award Certificate, such amendment, modification or termination shall not, without the Participant's consent, reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment or termination (with the per-share value of an Option or SAR for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment or termination over the exercise or base price of such Award); 
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.1 or in connection with a Change in Control, without the prior approval of the stockholders of the Company, (i) the exercise price of an Option or base price of a SAR may not be reduced, directly or indirectly, (ii) an option or SAR may not be cancelled in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or SARs with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise price or 
A-18 
 base price of the original Option or SAR, or otherwise, and (iii) the Company may not repurchase an Option or SAR for value (in cash or otherwise) from a Participant if the current Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Option or SAR is lower than the exercise price or base price per share of the Option or SAR; and 
(c)    No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material respect any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant affected thereby. An outstanding Award shall not be deemed to be "adversely affected" by a Plan amendment if such amendment would not reduce or diminish the value of such Award determined as if the Award had been exercised, vested, cashed in or otherwise settled on the date of such amendment (with the per-share value of an Option or SAR for this purpose being calculated as the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value as of the date of such amendment over the exercise or base price of such Award). 
15.3    COMPLIANCE AMENDMENTS.    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or in any Award Certificate to the contrary, the Board may amend the Plan or an Award Certificate, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or Award Certificate to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature (including, but not limited to, Section 409A of the Code), and to the administrative regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any amendment made pursuant to this Section 15.3 to any Award granted under the Plan without further consideration or action. 
ARTICLE 16 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
16.1    RIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS. 
(a)    No Participant or any Eligible Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan. Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor the Committee is obligated to treat Participants or Eligible Participants uniformly, and determinations made under the Plan may be made by the Committee selectively among Eligible Participants who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards (whether or not such Eligible Participants are similarly situated). 
(b)    Nothing in the Plan, any Award Certificate or any other document or statement made with respect to the Plan, shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate any Participant's employment or status as an officer, or any Participant's service as a director or consultant, at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue as an employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Affiliate, whether for the duration of a Participant's Award or otherwise. 
(c)    Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under this Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company or any Affiliate and, accordingly, subject to Article 15, this Plan and the benefits hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Committee without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
(d)    No Award gives a Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such person in connection with such Award. 
16.2    WITHHOLDING.    The Company or any Affiliate shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company or such Affiliate, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes (including the Participant's FICA obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the Plan. The obligations of the Company under the Plan will be conditioned on such payment or arrangements and the Company or such Affiliate will, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at the time the Award is 
A-19 
 granted or thereafter, any such withholding requirement may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by withholding from the Award Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the amount required to be withheld in accordance with applicable tax requirements (up to the maximum individual statutory rate in the applicable jurisdiction as may be permitted under then-current accounting principles to qualify for equity classification), in accordance with such procedures as the Committee establishes. All such elections shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
16.3    SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATED TO SECTION 409A OF THE CODE. 
(a)    General. It is intended that the payments and benefits provided under the Plan and any Award shall either be exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The Plan and all Award Certificates shall be construed in a manner that effects such intent. Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Plan or any Award is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Company, its Affiliates nor their respective directors, officers, employees or advisers (other than in his or her capacity as a Participant) shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant or other taxpayer as a result of the Plan or any Award. 
(b)    Definitional Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or in any Award Certificate to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt "deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code ("Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation") would otherwise be payable or distributable, or a different form of payment (e.g., lump sum or installment) of such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation would be effected, under the Plan or any Award Certificate by reason of the occurrence of a Change in Control, or the Participant's Disability or separation from service, such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation will not be payable or distributable to the Participant, and/or such different form of payment will not be effected, by reason of such circumstance unless the circumstances giving rise to such Change in Control, Disability or separation from service meet any description or definition of "change in control event", "disability" or "separation from service", as the case may be, in Section 409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition). This provision does not prohibit the vesting of any Award upon a Change in Control, Disability or separation from service, however defined. If this provision prevents the payment or distribution of any amount or benefit, or the application of a different form of payment of any amount or benefit, such payment or distribution shall be made at the time and in the form that would have applied absent the Change in Control, Disability or separation from service as applicable. 
(c)    Allocation among Possible Exemptions. If any one or more Awards granted under the Plan to a Participant could qualify for any separation pay exemption described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(b)(9), but such Awards in the aggregate exceed the dollar limit permitted for the separation pay exemptions, the Company shall determine which Awards or portions thereof will be subject to such exemptions. 
(d)    Six-Month Delay in Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or in any Award Certificate to the contrary, if any amount or benefit that would constitute Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation would otherwise be payable or distributable under this Plan or any Award Certificate by reason of a Participant's separation from service during a period in which the Participant is a Specified Employee (as defined below), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by the Committee under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A- 3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes): (i) the amount of such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following the Participant's separation from service will be accumulated through and paid or provided on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant's separation from service (or, if the Participant dies during such period, within 30 days after the Participant's death) (in either case, the "Required Delay Period"); and (ii) the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume at the end of the Required Delay Period. For purposes of this Plan, the term "Specified Employee" has the meaning given such term in Code Section 409A and the final regulations thereunder. 
A-20 
(e)    Installment Payments. If, pursuant to an Award, a Participant is entitled to a series of installment payments, such Participant's right to the series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not to a single payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "series of installment payments" has the meaning provided in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) (or any successor thereto). 
(f)    Timing of Release of Claims Whenever an Award conditions a payment or benefit on the Participant's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such release must be executed and all revocation periods shall have expired within sixty (60) days after the date of termination of the Participant's employment; failing which such payment or benefit shall be forfeited. If such payment or benefit is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, the Company may elect to make or commence payment at any time during such 60-day period. If such payment or benefit constitutes Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, then, subject to subsection (c) above, (i) if such 60-day period begins and ends in a single calendar year, the Company may make or commence payment at any time during such period at its discretion, and (ii) if such 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in the next calendar year, the payment shall be made or commence during the second such calendar year (or any later date specified for such payment under the applicable Award), even if such signing and non- revocation of the release occur during the first such calendar year included within such 60- day period. In other words, a Participant is not permitted to influence the calendar year of payment based on the timing of signing the release. 
(g)    Permitted Acceleration. The Company shall have the sole authority to make any accelerated distribution permissible under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4) to Participants of deferred amounts, provided that such distribution(s) meets the requirements of Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4). 
16.4    UNFUNDED STATUS OF AWARDS.    The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Certificate shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of grantor trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Shares or payments in lieu of Shares or with respect to Awards. This Plan is not intended to be subject to ERISA. 
16.5    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BENEFITS.    No payment under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate unless provided otherwise in such other plan. Nothing contained in the Plan will prevent the Company from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific c 
16.6    EXPENSES.    The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Affiliates. 
16.7    TITLES AND HEADINGS.    The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control. 
16.8    GENDER AND NUMBER.    Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 
16.9    FRACTIONAL SHARES.    No fractional Shares shall be issued and the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares shall be eliminated by rounding up or down. 
A-21 
16.10    GOVERNMENT AND OTHER REGULATIONS. 
(a)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no Participant who acquires Shares pursuant to the Plan may, during any period of time that such Participant is an affiliate of the Company (within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1933 Act), sell such Shares, unless such offer and sale is made (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act, which is current and includes the Shares to be sold, or (ii) pursuant to an appropriate exemption from the registration requirement of the 1933 Act, such as that set forth in Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act. 
(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if at any time the Committee shall determine that the registration, listing or qualification of the Shares covered by an Award upon any Exchange or under any foreign, federal, state or local law or practice, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such Award or the purchase or receipt of Shares thereunder, no Shares may be purchased, delivered or received pursuant to such Award unless and until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any condition not acceptable to the Committee. Any Participant receiving or purchasing Shares pursuant to an Award shall make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as the Committee may request to assure compliance with the foregoing or any other applicable legal requirements. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to the Committee's determination that all related requirements have been fulfilled. The Company shall in no event be obligated to register any securities pursuant to the 1933 Act or applicable state or foreign law or to take any other action in order to cause the issuance and delivery of such certificates to comply with any such law, regulation or requirement. 
16.11    GOVERNING LAW.    To the extent not governed by federal law, the Plan and all Award Certificates shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 
16.12    SEVERABILITY.    In the event that any provision of this Plan is found to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable under any applicable law, such invalidity or unenforceability will not be construed as rendering any other provisions contained herein as invalid or unenforceable, and all such other provisions will be given full force and effect to the same extent as though the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained herein. 
16.13    NO LIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS OF COMPANY.    The grant of any Award shall not in any way affect the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassification or changes in its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. The Plan shall not restrict the authority of the Company, for proper corporate purposes, to draft or assume awards, other than under the Plan, to or with respect to any person. If the Committee so directs, the Company may issue or transfer Shares to an Affiliate, for such lawful consideration as the Committee may specify, upon the condition or understanding that the Affiliate will transfer such Shares to a Participant in accordance with the terms of an Award granted to such Participant and specified by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. 
The foregoing is hereby acknowledged as being the Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan as adopted by the Board on November 2, 2018 and approved by the Company's stockholders on January 31, 2019.
