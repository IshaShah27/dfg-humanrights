PROXY STATEMENT  For the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders

     PROXY STATEMENT   
[END TABLE]
                This proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") and the accompanying proxy or voting instruction card relate to the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Ethan Allen") to be held at the Ethan Allen Corporate Headquarters, 25 Lake Avenue Extension, Danbury, Connecticut 06811 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, November 14, 2018. 
                The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") is soliciting proxies from stockholders in order to provide every stockholder an opportunity to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders at the Annual Meeting, whether or not such stockholder attends in person. A proxy authorizes a person other than a stockholder, called the "proxyholder," who will be present at the Annual Meeting, to cast the votes that the stockholder would be entitled to cast at the Annual Meeting if the stockholder were present in person. It is expected that this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy or voting instruction card will be first mailed or delivered to our stockholders beginning on or about October 2, 2018. 
                When used in this Proxy Statement, "we," "us," "our," "Ethan Allen" or the "Company" refers to Ethan Allen and its subsidiaries collectively or, if the context so requires, Ethan Allen individually. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on November 14, 2018.
The Notice of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proxy statement and the 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders are available at www.proxyvote.com.   Table of Contents

     Proposals and Voting Recommendations   
[END TABLE]
                Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following matters at the 2018 Annual Stockholder Meeting: 
                The Board of Directors believes that good corporate governance is important to ensure that the Company is managed for the long-term benefit of its stockholders and to enhance the creation of long-term stockholder value. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that support this belief, strengthens Board and management accountability and comply with the corporate governance requirements imposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), including, among others:  Table of Contents 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
                Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. is a vertically integrated interior design and home furnishings company, serving consumers around the world. To effectively manage our enterprise requires a strong governance foundation, as well as leadership with an understanding of the diverse needs of our consumers and associates. The composition of the Board reflects an appropriate mix of skill sets, experience, and qualifications that are relevant to the business and governance of the Company. Each individual Director epitomizes the Company's Leadership Principles, possesses the highest ethics and integrity, and demonstrates commitment to representing the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders. Each director also has individual experiences that provide practical wisdom and foster mature judgment in the boardroom. Collectively, the directors bring business, international, government, technology, marketing, retail operations, and other experiences that are relevant to the Company's vertical operations. The Board of Directors has general oversight responsibility for the Company's affairs pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, and the committee charters, corporate governance guidelines and other policies under which the Company operates. The Board is deeply involved in the Company's strategic planning process, leadership development, succession planning, and oversight of risk management. In exercising its fiduciary duties, the Board represents and acts on behalf of the Company's stockholders and is committed to strong corporate governance, as reflected through its policies and practices. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     BOARD INDEPENDENCE   
[END TABLE]
                The Board of Directors has determined that nominees James B. Carlson, John J. Dooner, Jr., Domenick J. Esposito, Mary Garrett, James W. Schmotter and Tara I. Stacom (six nominees for the Board of Directors) are independent directors within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board determined that these directors and nominees not only met all "bright-line" criteria under the NYSE rules, but also that, based on all known relevant facts and circumstances, there did not exist any relationship that would compromise the independence of these directors. In order to be considered "independent" by the Board of Directors, a director must (i) be free of any relationship that, applying the rules of the NYSE, would preclude a finding of independence and must (ii) not have any material relationship (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization) with us or any of our affiliates or any of our executive officers or any of our affiliates' executive officers.

     BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE   
[END TABLE]
                The Board of Directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide independent oversight of management. The Board believes that, given the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, the optimal Board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. 
                At present, the Board of Directors has chosen to continue combining the two roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that the best interests of the Company are served by Mr. Kathwari serving in both roles taking account of his unique long-standing tenure with, and investment in, the Company and also the Board's utilization of a strong Lead Independent Director. The Board of Directors believes that this governance structure provides the basis for clear, efficient executive authority in the Company, especially taking into account the Company's flat management structure, while balancing appropriate oversight by the Board of Directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Lead Independent Director   
[END TABLE]
                Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the Chairman is not an independent director, the Board shall select a Lead Independent Director from among the members of the Board who are determined by the Board to be independent. The selection of the  Table of Contents
Lead Independent Director occurs at the annual planning meeting of the Board of Directors. The Lead Independent Director has such clearly delineated duties and responsibilities as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. While the Board has chosen to continue combining the two roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, it believes that a suitably empowered Lead independent director who is expressly authorized to exert de facto control of the Company by asserting independent leadership of the Board, further promotes the Board's independence from management. The Board formally designated Dr. James W. Schmotter, an independent, non-executive director, as its Lead Independent Director through the Annual Meeting. He organizes and chairs meetings of the independent directors and organizes, facilitates and communicates observations of the independent directors to the Chief Executive Officer, although each director is free to communicate directly with the Chief Executive Officer. The duties and responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and include, among others:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH & COMMUNICATION WITH DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
                During fiscal 2018, the Board and management held one investor conference to allow direct interaction and communication amongst the Company and its stockholders and the investment community. Stockholders or interested parties may communicate with the Chairman, the Lead Independent Director, the full Board of Directors, a full committee, individual committee members or individual directors by sending communications to the Office of the Secretary, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., PO BOX 1966, Danbury, Connecticut 06813-1966 for forwarding to the appropriate director(s). Please specify to whom your correspondence should be directed and the nature of your interest in the Company. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of the Company's internal audit department and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters. 
                The Secretary shall review any such correspondence and forward to the Board a summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or committees thereof or that the Secretary otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time review a log of all correspondence received by the Company that is addressed to members of the Board and request copies of any such correspondence. Typically, the Secretary would not forward to the Board communications of a personal nature or not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, including junk mail, mass mailings, advertisements, magazines, solicitations, job inquiries, opinion surveys or polls. 
                Additional investor information is available at  www.ethanallen.com/investors. Stockholders may also electronically submit their communications to the following e-mail address: ETHBoard@ethanallen.com.

     BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT   
[END TABLE]
                While risk management is primarily the responsibility of our management, the Board of Directors provides overall risk oversight focusing on the most significant risks. The Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to identify risk areas and provide oversight of the Company's risk management, to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and to enhance stockholder value. A fundamental part of the Board's risk management is to understand the risks the Company faces and what steps management is taking to mitigate those risks. The Board of Directors participates in discussions with management concerning the Company's overall level of risk, the Company's business strategy and organizational objectives which are all integral components of its assessment of management's tolerance for risk. 
                The Company has implemented a Company-wide enterprise risk management process to identify and assess the major risks and develop strategies for controlling, mitigating and monitoring risk. As part of this process, information is gathered throughout the Company to identify and prioritize these major risks. The identified risks and risk mitigation strategies are validated with management and discussed with the Audit Committee on an ongoing basis. 
                The Audit Committee reviews our risk management programs and regularly reports on these items to the full Board. Our Internal Audit group is responsible for monitoring the enterprise risk management process and in that role reports directly to the Audit Committee. Other members of senior management who have responsibility for designing and implementing various aspects of our risk management process also regularly meet with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee discusses financial and operational risks with our Chief  Table of Contents
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and receives reports from other members of senior management with regard to our identified risks. 
                The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing any risks relating to our compensation policies and practices. Specifically, the Compensation Committee oversees the design of incentive compensation arrangements of our executive officers to implement our pay-for-performance philosophy without encouraging or rewarding excessive or inappropriate risk-taking by our executive officers. 
                Finally, cybersecurity is a critical part of risk management for the Company. The Board appreciates the rapidly evolving nature of threats presented by cybersecurity incidents and is committed to the prevention, timely detection, and mitigation of the effects of any such incidents on the Company. With respect to cybersecurity, the Board receives regular reports from management, including updates on the internal and external cybersecurity threat landscape, incident response, assessment and training activities, and relevant legislative, regulatory, and technical developments. 
                Our management regularly conducts additional reviews of risks, as needed, or as requested by the Board or the Audit Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     COMMITTEE CHARTERS, CODE OF CONDUCT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES   
[END TABLE]
                The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Conduct"), Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee are available on the Company's website at  www.ethanallen.com/governance. You may also request printed copies of the Code of Conduct, the Governance Guidelines or the committee charter(s), free of charge, by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., PO BOX 1966, Danbury, CT 06813-1966. 
                The Board has approved a set of corporate governance guidelines in accordance with rules of the NYSE. These guidelines set forth the key policies relating to corporate governance, including director qualification standards, director responsibilities and director compensation. The Corporate Governance Guidelines cover, among other things, the duties and responsibilities of and independence standards applicable to our directors. The Corporate Governance Guidelines also cover the Board's role in overseeing executive compensation, compensation and expenses of non-management directors, communications between stockholders and directors, and Board committee structures and assignments. 
                Our Code of Conduct requires that each individual deal fairly, honestly and constructively with governmental and regulatory bodies, customers, suppliers and competitors. It prohibits any individual's taking unfair advantage through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information or misrepresentation of material facts. It imposes an express duty to act in the best interests of the Company and to avoid influences, interests or relationships that could give rise to an actual or apparent conflict of interest. Further, it also prohibits directors, officers and employees from competing with us, using Company property or information, or such employee's position, for personal gain, and taking corporate opportunities for personal gain. Waivers of our Code of Conduct must be explicit. Any waiver of the Code of Conduct for directors or executive officers may only be made by the Board or the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee, and any waivers or amendments will be publicly communicated, as appropriate, including by a posting on our website within four business days. We granted no waivers under our Code of Conduct in fiscal 2018. 
                Sustainability practices are a fundamental part of our Company's operations. Our Board, along with our customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, understand that a modern approach to running our Company must be aligned with a commitment to sustainability. We believe that integrating our social and environmental values into our business as part of that commitment generates long-term value for our business, our stockholders and the global community at large. In addition to our overall dedication to ethical and accountable business practices, our corporate social responsibility commitments include the areas of environmental sustainability and community connections. We believe that these commitments create value for our stockholders and help position us to continuously improve business performance. Our strategy focuses our efforts on those areas most significant to our business, including health and safety, environmental stewardship, community and stakeholder engagement, human rights, and transparency. As part of our commitment, the Board and its committees are actively engaged in overseeing our sustainability practices and to ensure focus on these topics starts from the top. The Board oversees policies, positions and systems for environment, health, safety and social responsibility, compliance and risk management. The Company's 2018 Sustainability Report is available at www.ethanallen.com/investors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
                During fiscal 2018, there were four regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors including the meeting in connection with the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Independent directors also met four times in executive session without management present. The Lead Independent Director, currently Dr. James W. Schmotter, chaired the executive sessions.  Table of Contents
                All directors are expected to attend all regularly scheduled and special Board of Directors meetings, independent director meetings and committee meetings, as appropriate. The Board of Directors realizes that scheduling conflicts may arise from time to time which prevent a director from attending a particular meeting. However, it is the Board's explicit policy that each director shall give priority to his or her obligations to the Company. All directors who then held office attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In fiscal year 2018, there was 100% attendance by each director at each of the four regularly scheduled Board of Directors meetings, and for directors serving on such committees, there was 100% attendance at the four regularly scheduled Audit Committee meetings, two regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings, and two regularly scheduled Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee meetings. As set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company's policy is to expect the resignation of any director who is absent from more than twenty-five percent of regularly scheduled Board meetings or committee meetings in a fiscal year. 
                The Board of Directors has established three standing committees: the Audit Committee; the Compensation Committee; and the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee. Committee memberships of each nominee and continuing or current director are set forth below: 
                Additionally, the Board of Directors determined that each of the members of the standing committees is (i) independent within the meaning of the listings standards of the NYSE, including the additional requirements applicable to members of the audit and compensation committees, as applicable, (ii) non-employee directors (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) and (iii) outside directors (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")). See "Corporate Governance". 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Audit Committee   
[END TABLE]
                The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, which was adopted by the Board. Pursuant to its charter, on behalf of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial statements, auditors, financial statement audits, financial reporting process, system of internal accounting and financial controls, and internal audit function. In so doing, the Committee seeks to maintain free and open communication between the Committee and the Company's independent registered public accountants, the internal auditors and management. The Audit Committee is also responsible for review and approval of any related party transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. The responsibilities and activities of the Audit Committee are further described in "Audit Committee Report" and the Audit Committee charter. 
                Each of the current members of the Audit Committee is an independent director within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards. The Audit Committee meets a minimum of four times a year, and holds such additional meetings as it deems necessary to perform its responsibilities. The Audit Committee met five times during 2018. A report of the Audit Committee is set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Committee   
[END TABLE]
                The Compensation Committee determines our compensation policies and the level and forms of compensation provided to our Board members and executive officers, as discussed more fully under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis". In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves stock-based compensation for our directors, officers and employees, and oversees the administration of our Stock Incentive Plan. Additionally, the Compensation Committee approves the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" with respect to compensation of the Company's executive officers in accordance with applicable rules of the SEC. The Compensation Committee is authorized to retain and terminate compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors to the Committee and to approve the engagement of any such consultant, counsel or advisor, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate after specifically analyzing the independence of any such consultant retained by the Committee.  Table of Contents
                Each of the current members of the Compensation Committee is an independent director within the meaning of the applicable NYSE rules, including the enhanced independence requirements applicable to members of compensation committees. The Compensation Committee meets a minimum of two times a year, and holds such additional meetings as it deems necessary to perform its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee held four meetings and individual Compensation Committee members communicated, when necessary, by telephone or other means during fiscal 2018. A report of the Compensation Committee is set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee   
[END TABLE]
                The duties of the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee include, but are not limited to, the duty to: (i) develop qualification criteria for the members of the Board of Directors and nominate or recommend to the Board of Directors individuals to serve on the Board of Directors; (ii) review, annually, the qualifications of each member of the Board of Directors; (iii) review and monitor the Company's corporate governance policies and guidelines, including the Company's trading policy for its directors and executive officers; and (iv) make an annual assessment of the Board of Directors' performance and report to the Board of Directors. 
                The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee follows the procedure concerning nominations or consideration of director candidates recommended by stockholders set forth in the By-Laws. The By-Laws of the Company permit stockholders, as of the Record Date, to nominate director candidates at the Annual Meeting, subject to certain notification requirements. Additionally, in 2016, the Board adopted a balanced and market-standard proxy access By-law in step with the public companies that have adopted proxy access. Our By-laws permit a stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two directors or 20% of our Board. Stockholders and nominees must satisfy the requirements set forth in the by-laws in connection with such nominations. We believe that this by-law provision provides meaningful, effective and accessible proxy access rights to our stockholders, and balances those benefits against the risk of misuse or abuse by stockholders with special interests that are not shared by all or a significant percentage of our stockholders. See "Stockholder Proposals and Nomination of Directors" under "Questions and Answers" for information on how to submit a proposal or nominate a director. 
                Each of the current members of the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee is an independent director within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee meets a minimum of two times a year, and holds such additional meetings as it deems necessary to perform its responsibilities. The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee held four meetings and individual Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee members communicated, when necessary, by telephone or other means during fiscal 2018. 
                The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee seeks candidates who demonstrate a willingness and ability to prepare for, attend and participate in all Board of Directors and committee meetings and whose experience and skill would complement the then existing mix of directors. Among the criteria used to evaluate nominees for the Board is diversity of viewpoints, background and experience, including diversity of race, gender, ethnicity, age and cultural background. The Board believes that such diversity provides varied perspectives which promote active and constructive dialogue among Board members and between the Board and management, resulting in more effective oversight. The Board believes this diversity is amply demonstrated in the varied backgrounds, experience, qualifications and skills of the current and proposed members of the Board. In the Board's executive sessions and in annual performance evaluations conducted by the Board and its committees, the Board from time to time considers whether the members of the Board reflect such diversity and whether such diversity contributes to a constructive and collegial environment. 
                The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee gathers suggestions as to individuals who may be available to meet the Board of Directors' future needs from a variety of sources, such as past and present directors, stockholders, colleagues and other parties with which a member of the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee or the Board of Directors has had business dealings, and undertakes a preliminary review of the individuals suggested. Candidates recommended by stockholders will be considered in the same manner as other candidates. At such times as the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee determines that a relatively near-term need exists and the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee believes that an individual's qualities and skills would complement the then existing mix of directors, the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee or its Chair will contact the individual. The Chair will, after such contact, discuss the individual with the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee. Based on the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee's evaluation of potential nominees and the Company's needs, the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee determines whether to nominate the individual for election as a director. While the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee has not, in the past, engaged any third-party firm or consultant to identify or evaluate nominees, in accordance with its charter, may do so in the future. 
                The Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee unanimously recommended the nominees named in this Proxy Statement as the individuals with the experience, industry knowledge, integrity, ability to devote time and energy, and commitment to the interests of all stockholders best qualified to execute our strategic plan and create value for all our stockholders.

     PROPOSAL 1:    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
                At the Annual Meeting, each of the seven nominees described below will stand for re-election to serve as directors until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The seven nominees were nominated by the Board of Directors in accordance with recommendations by our Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee. Each nominee has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement as a nominee for election as a director and agreed to serve if elected. All of the seven nominees described below are currently members of the Board of Directors. The information set forth below includes, with respect to each nominee for election as director, his or her age, present principal occupation, specific expertise, qualifications and skills along with other business experience, directorships in other publicly held companies, membership on committees of the Board of Directors and period of service as a director of the Company. Also set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to each nominee's nomination as a director, in light of the Company's business. 
                Each director is elected annually by a majority of the votes cast. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director nominee's election must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to the election of that nominee in order for the nominee to be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast. It is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the accompanying proxies submitted by stockholders to vote for the seven nominees described below unless authority to vote for the nominees or any individual nominee is withheld by a stockholder in such stockholder's proxy. If for any reason any nominee becomes unable or unwilling to serve at the time of the Annual Meeting, or for good cause will not serve as a director, the persons named as proxies will have discretionary authority to vote for the remaining nominees and for a substitute nominee(s) to fill the vacancy unless the Board reduces the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Alternatively, the Board of Directors may choose to reduce the size of the Board, as permitted by our Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"). It is not anticipated that any nominee will be unavailable or will decline to serve as a director. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR each of the seven nominees.   Table of Contents

     DIRECTOR COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
                For fiscal 2018, each independent director received $60,000 per annum and an annual stock option award. The number of stock options awarded was determined by dividing the market price of the Company's stock at the grant date into $100,000. Additional quarterly fees are paid to the chairperson of each of the committees as follows: Audit Committee $4,000; Compensation Committee $2,000; and Nominations Committee $2,000. If a committee holds more than four meetings (either in person or telephonically) on days when the full Board does not meet, committee members will be paid an additional $1,000 for each additional meeting beginning with the fifth such meeting. Employee directors do not receive additional compensation for serving on the Board of Directors. Directors serving on committees for part of a year receive a pro rata share of fees.

     Policies and Procedures with Respect to Transactions with Related Persons   
[END TABLE]
                The Company recognizes that transactions between the Company and related persons present a potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Company's general policies with respect to such transactions are included in its Code of Conduct and, the administration of which is overseen by the Corporate Governance & Nominations Committee. The Company defines "related party" transaction as any transaction or series of related transactions in excess of $120,000 in which the Company is a party and in which a "related person" had, has or will have direct or indirect material interest. Related persons include (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year, was, a director or executive officer of us or a nominee to become a director, (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the director, executive officer, nominee or more than 5% beneficial owner and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director, executive officer, nominee or more than 5% beneficial owner and (iv) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest. 
                The Company collects information about potential related party transactions in its annual questionnaires completed by directors and officers as well as throughout the year at its quarterly disclosure control committee meetings, comprised of key management responsible for significant business units, departments or divisions. Potential related party transactions are first reviewed and assessed by our General Counsel to consider the materiality of the transactions and then reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews and considers all relevant information available to it about each related party transaction and upon its approval presents the facts to the members of the Board of Directors not associated with the potential related party transaction. A related party transaction is approved or ratified only if such members of the Board of Directors determine that it is not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Audit Committee then oversees any transaction between the Company and any related person (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) and any other potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis in accordance with Company policies and procedures.

Mr. van Puyenbroeck reports to the Senior Vice President, Business Development. During fiscal year 2018, the Company paid approximately $250,000 in aggregate compensation to Mr. van Puyenbroeck. The compensation was consistent with compensation paid to other employees holding similar positions and was composed of salary. The Compensation Committee and the Board expects periodically and at each fiscal year end to provide an ongoing review of Mr. van Puyenbroeck's employment with the Company, including in relation to his compensation.

     Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   
[END TABLE]
                Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and owners of over 10% of our Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE and furnish us with a copy of each report filed. Based solely on our review of copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that all reports were filed or that no reports were required, we are not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the Section 16(a) filing requirements by any executive officer, director or owner of over 10% of our Common Stock during fiscal year 2018, excepting for a forfeiture of a restricted stock unit grant, which forfeiture was inadvertently not timely reported when effected due to administrative oversight. The restricted stock units were issued during fiscal 2018 pursuant to the Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (the "Company") Stock Incentive Plan on July 26, 2017 and were forfeited back to the Company during fiscal 2018 prior to vesting, upon approval of such forfeiture by the Compensation Committee.

     PROPOSAL 2:    TO APPROVE, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
                Our executive compensation program is designed to facilitate long-term stockholder value creation. Our focus on pay-for-performance and on corporate governance promotes alignment with the interests of the Company's stockholders. 
                The Company seeks stockholder approval, on a non-binding basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" vote. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the compensation policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
                At the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders were asked to approve the Company's executive compensation program. A substantial majority (89%) of the votes cast on the "say-on-pay" proposal at the meeting were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes that these results reaffirm our stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation. 
                The Compensation Committee strives to continue to ensure that the design of the Company's executive compensation program is focused on long-term stockholder value creation (with a meaningful and growing portion of the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers being at risk, performance-based, tied to performance metrics that include good stewardship of the Company's resources, and not guaranteed) and emphasizes pay for performance and does not encourage the taking of short-term risks at the expense of long-term results. 
                The Compensation Committee intends to continue to use the "say-on-pay" vote as a guidepost for stockholder sentiment and to consider stockholder feedback in making compensation decisions. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Process for Determining Executive Compensation" for additional discussion of our stockholder outreach efforts during fiscal 2018 and "Annual Incentive Compensation Program Enhancements for Fiscal 2019" for additional discussion about the changes to our executive compensation programs implemented during fiscal 2018. 
                In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Compensation Table sections. The Compensation Committee in fiscal 2018 engaged in dialogue with many of our significant stockholders about the Company's approach to executive compensation and has made numerous enhancements in recent years to strengthen the link between pay and performance, further link compensation to our business and talent strategies and clearly detail the rationale for pay decisions. 
                For the reasons outlined above, we believe that our executive compensation program is well designed, appropriately aligns executive pay with Company performance and incentivizes desirable behavior. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to endorse our executive compensation program by voting on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareowners approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Tables and the related narrative."
                This proposal allows our stockholders to express their opinions regarding the decisions of the Compensation Committee on the annual compensation program for the Named Executive Officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board values shareowners' opinions and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. Further, this advisory vote will serve as an additional tool to guide the Board and the Compensation Committee in continuing to improve the alignment of the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of Ethan Allen and its stockholders, and is consistent with our commitment to high standards of corporate governance and stockholder engagement. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers.   Table of Contents

                The purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis is to provide material information about the Company's executive compensation objectives and policies for its Named Executive Officers, ("NEOs") and to put into perspective the tabular disclosures and related narratives. The non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation of the NEOs submitted to stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting was approved by over 89% of the votes cast. We regularly engage in outreach efforts with our stockholders relating to a variety of topics and involve our Compensation Committee Chair or one or more independent directors in these conversations as appropriate. We use the information gathered through these outreach efforts to help inform our compensation decisions and look forward to continued dialogue on compensation matters and other issues relevant to our business.

     Process for Determining Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the composition and value of the compensation programs for all of our NEOs. Our Chief Executive Officer, ("CEO"), and Executive Vice President, Administration, who is responsible for the Company's Human Resources functions, provide input on program design and information on the Company's and the furniture industry's performance. The Compensation Committee also understands and considers stockholder viewpoints on compensation. 
                The Compensation Committee may not delegate its primary responsibility of overseeing executive officer compensation, but it may delegate to management the administrative aspects of our compensation programs that do not involve the setting of compensation levels for executive officers. 
                All equity awards to executives, including stock options, PSUs, restricted stock and restricted stock units are approved by the Compensation Committee. 
                The Compensation Committee maintains sole authority to retain, terminate, approve fees and other terms of engagement of its compensation consultant and to obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors. 
                In early fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee Chair, together with the Executive Vice President, Administration, who is responsible for the Company's Human Resources functions, engaged in dialogue with a number of the Company's larger institutional investors regarding approaches to executive compensation and incentives. The Compensation Committee also reviewed executive compensation and incentive structures used by the peer group companies. In part, this dialogue and review focused on whether the Company's approach to executive compensation should move from a primary focus on Adjusted Operating Income performance to metrics that include Adjusted Operating Income along with revenue growth and total stockholder returns. In the past, the Compensation Committee believed that the Company's executive incentives should be primarily correlated to high margin cash flow generation measured by Adjusted Operating Income in order to bring down debt, especially after the financial crisis and then challenges in the retail industry and to return capital to stockholders through an increase of dividends and share repurchases. Through its 2018 dialogue with investors, the Compensation Committee decided to expand the Company's incentive structure to include revenue growth and total stockholder returns in connection with executive compensation.

     Benchmarking using Peer Groups   
[END TABLE]
                The Compensation Committee established a peer group which, in its judgment, best represented the unique nature of the Company's vertical business model which integrates manufacturing, merchandising and retailing. 
                In developing the peer group, the population of U.S. based, publicly traded companies that were considered included:
                In addition to industry, branding and supply chain considerations, the Compensation Committee filtered companies by revenues, number of employees and market capitalization. Companies with higher revenues are included in the peer group since the Company competes for executives with such other companies that are in the home furnishings industry. The Compensation Committee established a peer group that reflects 15 companies to enable full comparisons to the Company, as follows (by revenue): 
                We believe that it is appropriate to offer industry-competitive cash and equity compensation packages to all of our NEOs in order to attract and retain top executive talent. The peer group allows us to monitor the compensation practices of our primary competitors for executive talent. However, we do not target any specific pay percentile of the peer group for our executive officers. Instead, we use this information to provide a general overview of market practices and to ensure that we make informed decisions regarding our executive pay programs. The Compensation Committee removed Tumi Holdings and Kate Spade & Co. from the peer group for fiscal 2018 because they were no longer publicly-traded companies.  Table of Contents

                In July 2017, the Compensation Committee completed the annual review of the salary levels for each of the NEOs. As part of the salary review process, the Compensation Committee reviewed and considered the performance of each NEO, relevant market data, the comparison of compensation among various levels of management, and the Company's overall performance. As a result of this review, the Compensation Committee determined the base salaries were appropriate and no annual increases were made for fiscal 2018. In October 2017, when Ms. Bliss assumed additional responsibilities, the Compensation Committee increased her base salary to $325,000, but made no changes to the base salaries of any of the other NEOs.

     Director Compensation Changes for Fiscal 2019   
[END TABLE]
                The Board of Directors reflected on the performance of the Company for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee's determination to not grant annual increases to the NEOs for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 and to not issue any discretionary bonuses to the NEOs for fiscal 2018, and that no incentive bonuses were earned by the NEOs for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. Based on this, the Compensation Committee together with the full Board of Directors made the determination to make a 10% reduction to their Director Fees earned or paid in cash for fiscal 2019.

     Annual Incentive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                All NEOs are eligible to earn cash awards under our annual incentive compensation program, which is designed to motivate and reward executives for performance on key annual measures. The annual incentive compensation program is based exclusively on attainment of financial metrics, measured on the Company's overall consolidated financial performance, that align our annual incentives with our strategy of driving growth, with an emphasis on profitability. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Fiscal 2018 Annual Incentive Performance Goal and Performance Comparison to Goal   
[END TABLE]
                In July 2017, the Compensation Committee established the financial metric used for the annual incentive compensation program for fiscal 2018 as Adjusted Operating Income. The Compensation Committee selected this metric because it drives stockholder value and reflects our emphasis on profitability during a period of transition of the Company's product programs and launch of a meaningful contract business. In the past, the Compensation Committee believed that the Company's executive incentives should be primarily correlated to high margin cash flow generation measured by Adjusted Operating Income in order to bring down debt, especially after the financial crisis and then challenges in the retail industry and to return capital to stockholders through an increase of dividends and share repurchases. Target, maximum and threshold awards, specified as a percentage of base salary, vary among various levels of management. The NEOs have the opportunity to earn awards between 50% of their target awards if we meet minimum threshold performance requirements and a maximum of 115% to 227% of their target incentive opportunity, based on performance.  Table of Contents
                The Compensation Committee established a target of 5% Adjusted Operating Income growth for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and established threshold and maximum performance levels as follows (in millions):

     Long-term Incentive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                To align our executive officers' pay outcomes with long-term performance and encourage long-term strategic thinking, our annual long-term incentive grants typically feature financial-based performance metrics. The long-term incentive award provisions of our Stock Incentive Plan provide for equity-based compensation including restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, or other forms of equity-based compensation. 
                The Compensation Committee establishes for the NEOs, other than the CEO, the target, maximum and threshold awards as a percentage of base salary on the grant date, which percentages may vary among the various levels of management. The target, maximum and threshold awards are specified as a fixed number of shares for the CEO. Our CEO has limited discretion during the year to approve additional equity-based grants to employees other than the NEOs.

                During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded the annual performance restricted stock unit grant to the CEO with a target level of 65,000 shares, a threshold level of 32,500 shares and a maximum of 82,250 shares. The Compensation Committee established the financial performance metric for the grant as Adjusted Operating Income per Share. This metric was selected because it drives stockholder value and reflects our emphasis on profitability during a period of transition of the Company's product programs and the launch of a meaningful contract business. In the past, the Compensation Committee believed that the Company's executive equity incentives should be primarily correlated to high margin cash flow generation measured by Adjusted Operating Income per Share in order to bring down debt, especially after the financial crisis and then challenges in the retail industry and to return capital to stockholders through an increase of dividends and share repurchases. Performance vesting of the performance restricted stock units is measured over two fiscal years and cumulatively for the upcoming three fiscal years. If either the two-year or cumulative three-year target is accomplished, then the percentage of performance restricted stock units vested would be determined by reference to the higher performance accomplishment percentage. 
                The Compensation Committee has historically awarded the annual long-term equity incentive grants to the CEO during the first quarter and to the NEOs, other than the CEO, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to change the timing of issuing such grants whereby annual grants for all the NEOs would be made in the first quarter of each fiscal year in order to align with market practices. As a result, the timing of the grants to the NEOs, other than the CEO, was shifted from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and no long-term incentive grants were made to the NEOs, other than the CEO, during fiscal 2018.

     Discretionary Incentive Grants for Fiscal 2018   
[END TABLE]
                The Compensation Committee awarded a restricted stock grant of 16,234 restricted stock units to the CEO on July 26, 2017. The grant was valued at $415,915 vesting ratably over two years. When initially granted, the Compensation Committee believed that a substantial reduction in the CEO's cash incentive compensation should be balanced with a grant of stock units providing incentives for long-term stock appreciation. However, the CEO recognizing the importance in demonstrating leadership in executive compensation matters elected to not accept the grant and returned the grant to the Company on January 24, 2018, which following the approval of Compensation Committee the grant was voided. 
                On August 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee made a modification to the performance restricted stock unit award issued to the CEO in July 2016, adding a fourth-year vesting opportunity. The modification was valued at $1,621,100 and extended the vesting period to June 30, 2020. When initially granted, the Compensation Committee believed the CEO's long-term incentives should be extended to provide long-term incentives for total shareholder returns. However, the CEO recognizing the importance in demonstrating leadership in executive compensation matters elected to not accept the modification to the grant and returned the modification to the Company on June 28, 2018, which following the approval of Compensation Committee the modification was voided. 
                In awarding the restricted stock grant and in approving the modification, the Compensation Committee also reflected on the leadership the CEO exhibited in not accepting a discretionary bonus for fiscal 2017, while the other NEOs received discretionary bonuses, and the strong focus exhibited by the CEO on positioning the Company for growth. The Compensation Committee subsequently acknowledged the leadership of the CEO in not accepting this compensation. The discretionary grant and modification that were awarded in fiscal 2018, but not accepted by the CEO and subsequently voided in fiscal 2018, are not included in the Compensation Tables.

     Stock Option Awards for Fiscal 2018   
[END TABLE]
                The NEOs and other executives are eligible to receive grants of stock options. The options have an exercise price of the closing price of our stock on the date of grant, vesting according to both the performance based and time-based criteria, and a ten-year term. Any stock options not fully vested on the date the employee separates are subject to forfeiture. These grants are designed for retention of the executive and to align the executive's compensation with the long-term success of the Company. The Compensation Committee did not make any grants of stock options to the NEOs in fiscal 2018.  Table of Contents

     Fiscal 2016 Performance Restricted Stock Unit Award Payout   
[END TABLE]
                The CEO achieved the performance-vesting requirement and received payouts with respect to the annual performance restricted stock unit award that were granted in fiscal 2016 and performance vested with a two-year and three-year vesting period over fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018. The award was paid out at 91.1% of the target number of shares. 
                The NEO's, other than the CEO, achieved the performance-vesting requirement with respect to the annual performance restricted stock unit awards that were granted in fiscal 2016 and performance vested with a two-year and three-year vesting period over fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018. The awards which performance-vested at 93.3% of the target number of shares will satisfy their time-based vesting requirement on April 19, 2019.

                The CEO has received no payout with respect to the annual performance restricted stock unit award that was granted in fiscal 2017 and performance vested with a two-year and three-year vesting period over fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019. The two-year threshold performance level was not met and three-year performance measurement period has not yet lapsed. 
                The NEOs, other than the CEO, have received no payout with respect to the annual performance restricted stock unit awards that were granted in fiscal 2017 and performance vested with a two-year and three-year vesting period over fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020. The two-year and three-year performance measurement periods have not yet lapsed.

     Change of Control Severance Plan for Executives   
[END TABLE]
                The change in control plan for NEO's, other than the CEO, was adopted to mitigate the concern that, in the event the Company is considering a change in control transaction, the employees involved in considering the transaction might otherwise be motivated to act in their own interests rather than the interests of the stockholders. Thus, the change in control provisions are designed so that employees are neither harmed nor given a windfall in the event of a change in control. 
                The Company's plans generally provide that a change in control may occur upon (i) any liquidation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company and Ethan Allen Global, Inc. taken as a whole, or (ii) any merger, or (iii) any person becoming a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the then outstanding voting stock of the Company or Ethan Allen Global, Inc.; or (iv) the Company's incumbent directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board of directors of the Company, except in connection with the election or nomination of directors approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the incumbent board of directors of the Company. 
                For any benefits to be earned, a change in control must occur and the executive's employment must be terminated within two years following the change in control, either by the Company without cause or the executive for good reason (often called a "double trigger"). The plan does not provide tax gross ups. Payments and benefits to the executive will be reduced to the extent necessary to result in the executive's retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits. For additional information, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control". Benefits provided under the program include (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to one times the sum of the executive's base salary and the average of the prior three years' annual Incentive Bonus and (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the pro-rated portion of the executive's average of the prior three years' annual Incentive Bonus for the year of termination. The Change in Control Severance Plan includes non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality provisions and waivers of customary claims.

     The Ethan Allen Retirement Savings Plan   
[END TABLE]
                The Company maintains the Ethan Allen Retirement Savings Plan, which is effective as of July 1, 1994 (the "Retirement Plan"). The Retirement Plan covers all employees, including the NEOs, who have completed at least three months of service. There is no enhanced benefit for executives. 
                The 401(k) portion of the Retirement Plan allows participants to defer up to 100% of their compensation, subject to certain statutory limitations. In fiscal 2018, the Company made matching contributions with a maximum contribution of $1,300 per participant. Matching contributions were made dollar for dollar on the first $500 of a participant's before tax contribution and $0.50 on the next $1,600 of a participant's before tax contributions. Participant contributions and employer matching contributions are immediately and fully vested. The Retirement Plan also allows for a profit-sharing contribution made by the Company to be distributed to participants. The Company made a $495,000 profit sharing contribution to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2018. 
                Investment options currently offered under the Retirement Plan include the Company's Common Stock. Participants direct the investment of their accounts under the Retirement Plan and may choose from some or all of the investment options designated by the Retirement Committee from time to time.

     Executive Perquisites/Other Personal Benefits   
[END TABLE]
                We offer a very limited amount of perquisites and other personal benefits to our NEOs. The Compensation Committee believes that these perquisites are reasonable and consistent with prevailing market practice and the Company's overall compensation program. Perquisites are not a material part of our compensation program. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs. In fiscal 2017, with the exception of Mr. Kathwari, the NEOs did not receive any perquisites. Mr. Kathwari received: (1) access to and use of Company cars (including driver, gas, registration, title, insurance and maintenance); (2) reimbursement of life insurance premiums up to $50,000; (3) a retirement contract (described below); (4) dividends and interest on a long-standing restricted stock book account established pursuant to his previous employment agreements; (5) Ethan Allen Retirement Savings Plan contributions made by the Company and (6) dividend equivalent payments on stock units awarded pursuant to a prior employment agreement. See footnote 6 to the "Summary Compensation Table". 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Employment Agreements   
[END TABLE]
                The Company generally does not enter into employment agreements and has no employment agreements in place with the exception of the employment agreement with Mr. Kathwari, the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee in 2015 initiated, negotiated and, on October 1, 2015, effective July 1, 2015, entered into the 2015 Employment Agreement, of which its incentive compensation components were subsequently approved by stockholders at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
                Pursuant to the 2015 Employment Agreement, Mr. Kathwari is entitled to a base salary of $1,150,000 per annum, during the five-year term of the 2015 Employment Agreement commencing July 1, 2015, without increase or guaranteed adjustment. He is eligible for an annual non-equity incentive compensation based on annual performance targets set annually by the Company, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. The annual incentive compensation payments provide for a target level of $750,000, a threshold level of $375,000 and a maximum level of $1,700,000. The agreement provides for an annual long-term incentive compensation award grant based on performance targets set annually by the Company, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors with a target level of 65,000 shares, a threshold level of 32,500 shares and a maximum of 82,250 shares. The agreement, among other provisions, also provides for benefits that may be earned in the event of a change of control or in the event of termination of employment. The agreement is filed as exhibit 10(e) of our 2018 annual report on form 10-K 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Deductibility Cap on Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million per year on the amount of compensation paid to certain of our executive officers that we may deduct from our federal income tax return for any single taxable year. There is an exception to the $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements, although this exception is severely limited beginning in 2018, as described below. The material terms of our incentive plans were previously approved by shareholders for purposes of Section 162(m), which allowed us to grant certain annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards designed to meet the definition of performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) in order to qualify for the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit. However, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the Company, the Compensation Committee did not previously limit executive compensation to amounts deductible under Section 162(m) if the Compensation Committee determined that doing so is in the best interests of the Company. 
                The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, substantially modifies Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and, among other things, eliminates the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018. As a result, beginning in 2018, compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million will generally be nondeductible, whether or not it is performance-based. In addition, beginning in 2018, the executive officers subject to Section 162(m) (the "Covered Employees") will include any individual who served as the CEO or Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers (other than the CEO and CFO) for the taxable year, and once an individual becomes a Covered Employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will remain a Covered Employee for all future years, including following any termination of employment. 
                The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) described above will not apply to compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not materially modified after that date. To the extent applicable to our existing contracts and awards, the Compensation Committee may avail itself of this transition rule. However, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition rule, no assurances can be given at this time that our existing contracts and awards, even if in place on November 2, 2017, will meet the requirements of the transition rule.

     Certain Conclusions as to Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                The Compensation Committee believes that long-term stockholder value is enhanced by corporate and individual performance achievements. Through the plans and practices described above, a meaningful portion of the Company's executive compensation is based on competitive pay practices, as well as corporate and individual performance. The Compensation Committee believes equity compensation, in the form of stock options, restricted stock and stock units is vital to the long-term success of the Company. The Compensation Committee remains committed to this policy, recognizing that the competitive market for talented executives and the cyclical nature of the Company's business may result in highly variable compensation for a particular time period.

     2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation   
[END TABLE]
                The Company maintains three nonqualified deferred compensation plans for Mr. Kathwari. (1) The dividend book account holds dividends and accrued interest payable from a restricted stock book account established pursuant to his previous employment agreements. As of each dividend record date for the Common Stock occurring on or after the date of any grant made pursuant to his previous employment agreements, of shares of restricted stock, but prior to the date such shares became vested or forfeited, an account established by the Company for the benefit of Mr. Kathwari was credited with an amount equal to the dividends which would have otherwise been paid with respect to the shares. Amounts credited to the account are credited with interest at the rate of 5% per year until distribution. Mr. Kathwari is fully vested in all amounts credited to the account, which will be distributed to him in cash as soon as practicable after the termination of his employment. (2) The Stock Unit account holds 126,000 stock units issued in connection with Mr. Kathwari's 1997 employment agreement and for which payment has been deferred until termination of employment. Dividends are paid in cash to Mr. Kathwari on these stock units. (3) The retirement contract account entitles Mr. Kathwari to a maximum payment of $225,000 under an agreement dated September 26, 1983, subject to a cost of living adjustment at the time of payment. Such payment has been deferred until the month in which his employment with the Company terminates, and shall be paid in 120 monthly installments. In the event Mr. Kathwari shall die before receiving all retirement payments Mr. Kathwari's widow shall be entitled to reduced retirement payments equal to one-half of the retirement payment amount until the earlier to occur of (a) her death or (b) the cumulative payment of 120 monthly payments to Mr. Kathwari and/or his widow.

     Change in Control   
[END TABLE]
                As of the end of fiscal year 2018 we maintained a change in control provision with the CEO as set forth in the 2015 Employment Agreement. We also have change in control provisions with all our NEOs as set forth in the Change in Control Severance Plan and in restricted stock and stock option agreements. 
                The Company's plans generally provide that a change in control may occur upon (i) any liquidation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company and Ethan Allen Global, Inc. taken as a whole, or (ii) any merger, or (iii) any person becoming a beneficial owner of more than 50% of the then outstanding voting stock of the Company or Ethan Allen Global, Inc.; or (iv) the Company's incumbent directors cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board of directors of the Company, except in connection with the election or nomination of directors approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the incumbent board of directors of the Company. 
                For any benefits to be earned, a change in control must occur and the executive's employment must be terminated within two years following the change in control, either by the Company without cause or the executive for good reason (often called a "double trigger"). The plan does not provide tax gross ups. Payments and benefits to the executive will be reduced to the extent necessary to result in the executive's retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits. The plans or agreements include non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality provisions and waivers of customary claims. 
                Potential payments under the plans and agreements are reflected in the table that follows under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control. The treatment of benefits under each plan or agreement on termination or change in control is detailed in the footnotes to the table. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control   
[END TABLE]
                The amount of compensation which would have been payable to the NEOs upon termination of employment, assuming a June 30, 2018 termination date, and for purposes of the last column, a change in control as of the same date, is listed in the following table. A termination of employment is a requirement for the acceleration of stock option grants and restricted stock awards upon a change in control. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan the Compensation Committee, may, in its discretion, notwithstanding the grant or award agreement, upon termination without cause, fully vest any and all Ethan Allen common stock awarded pursuant to a restricted stock award or stock option grant, unless the award was granted to a "covered employee" (as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations) and the award was designed to meet the exception for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. The chief financial officer, Mr. Whitely, is not included as a "covered employee" under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Mr. Kathwari's restricted stock awards are governed by his employment agreement and no assumption is made regarding Compensation Committee action fully vesting those awards. The amount shown assumes the Compensation Committee fully vested any and all time-based restricted stock awards and stock option grants and Mr. Whitely's performance-based restricted stock grants under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. If Mr. Kathwari's employment is terminated for any reason, including death, disability or change in control, the value of nonqualified deferred compensation plan accounts would be become immediately payable in accordance with the term of those agreements. See "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table for more information on those plans.  Table of Contents

     Equity Compensation Plan Information   
[END TABLE]
                The following table sets forth certain information regarding our equity compensation plans as of June 30, 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Policies and Risk   
[END TABLE]
                Our Compensation Committee regularly conducts risk assessments to determine the extent, if any, to which our compensation practices and programs may create incentives for excessive risk taking. Based on these assessments, we concluded that our policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
                As part of the risk assessments, the Compensation Committee reviewed the cash and equity incentive programs for senior executives and concluded that certain aspects of the programs reduce the likelihood of excessive risk taking. These aspects include the use of long-term equity awards to create incentives for senior executives to work for long-term growth of the Company, including claw-back provisions limiting the incentive to take excessive risk for short-term gains, imposing caps on cash bonuses, requiring compliance with our  Table of Contents
Code of Conduct and giving the Compensation Committee the power to reduce payouts under our compensation plans. More specifically, this conclusion was based on the following considerations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation   
[END TABLE]
                No member of the Compensation Committee is, or has ever been, an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, during the last fiscal year, no executive officer of the Company served as a director or member of the compensation or similar committee of another entity whose executive officer(s) serve as a member of the Board or the Compensation Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Pay Ratio Disclosure   
[END TABLE]
                In August 2015, the SEC issued final rules implementing the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires U.S. publicly traded companies to disclose the ratio of their Principal Executive Officer's compensation to that of their median employee. For this required disclosure, our Chief Executive Officer, is considered to be our Principal Executive Officer. 
                For fiscal year 2018:
                Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual compensation of all employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, was 86 to 1. 
                The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio permit companies to use various methodologies and assumptions, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates that reflect their employee population and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio that we have reported. 
                To identify the median employee, we used the total compensation, which includes base pay, bonus, incentive, commission, overtime, 401k company match, profit sharing, equity, and other compensation, as applicable, for all of our U.S. employees, excluding our CEO, and all of our employees located in Canada, Mexico and Honduras who were employed by us on June 22, 2018 as our consistently applied compensation measure (CACM"). We included full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees and did not annualize the compensation for our permanent full-time and part-time employees who were not employed with us for the entire fiscal year. We applied the U.S. dollar exchange rate as of June 22, 2018 to the compensation elements paid in Canadian, Mexican, and Honduran currency. No cost of living adjustments were applied. 
                Applying the CACM, we identified one employee as the median employee. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we used for determining total compensation for our NEOs as shown in the preceding 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

     PROPOSAL 3:    RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   
[END TABLE]
                The Audit Committee selects and hires our independent registered public accounting firm and has appointed KPMG LLP, ("KPMG"), as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. In executing its responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviews the qualifications, performance and independence of its registered public accountant annually. In conducting its review, the Audit Committee considered, among other things: information relating to audit effectiveness; the depth and expertise of the audit team, including their demonstrated understanding of the Company's businesses, significant accounting practices, and system of internal control over financial reporting; the quality and candor of KPMG's communications with the Audit Committee and management; the accessibility, responsiveness, technical competence, and professionalism of the lead audit partner and other members of the audit team assigned to our account; KPMG's tenure, institutional knowledge and deep expertise as our independent auditor; the impact to the Company of changing auditors; the appropriateness of KPMG's fees; and KPMG's ability to employ professional skepticism, objectivity, integrity, and trustworthiness. The Audit Committee also received from KPMG a formal written statement describing all relationships between the firm and the Company that might bear on the firm's independence, consistent with the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG any relationships that may impact the firm's objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the firm's independence. 
                While KPMG was the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 1989, in accordance with SEC rules and KPMG policies, the firm's lead engagement partner rotates every five years. In assessing independence, the Audit Committee reviews the fees paid, including those related to non-audit services. As a result of its evaluation of KPMG's qualifications, performance and independence, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. We are asking you to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
                Although ratification is not required by our By-Laws, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of KPMG to you for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee. If the Audit Committee's appointment is not ratified, it will reconsider the appointment, if appropriate. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
                Unless contrary instructions are given, shares represented by proxies solicited by the Board will be voted for the ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019. The affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required to ratify the appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Table of Contents

     Audit and Non-Audit Engagement Pre-Approval Policy   
[END TABLE]
                To help assure the independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has established a policy whereby all audit and non-audit engagements proposed to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Chair of the Audit Committee or, in the Chair's discretion or in the case that any such engagement is more than $10,000, the entire Audit Committee. All of the service provided to us by KPMG were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with this policy.

     AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT   
[END TABLE]
                The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process, the system of internal accounting and financial controls, the internal audit function, and the annual independent audit of the Company's financial statements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, has the primary responsibility to independently audit the Company's financial statements and its internal controls in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The duties of the Audit Committee include, but are not limited to:
                In accordance with SEC regulations, the Audit Committee has approved an Audit Committee Charter describing the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that each member of the Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE and the SEC, including the additional independence requirements applicable to audit committee members. See "Corporate Governance". The Board of Directors has determined that all Audit Committee members, as required by SEC regulations and NYSE rules, are financially literate with accounting or related finance management expertise, as interpreted by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that three members of the Audit Committee are an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K and independent as contemplated by Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act.  Table of Contents
                In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed, with management and KPMG, the audited financial statements contained within the Annual Report on Form 10-K, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures contained in those financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed with management and KPMG, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the results of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018 and KPMG's audit of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018. 
                The Audit Committee reviewed with KPMG, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, their judgment(s) as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles. The Audit Committee also reviewed such other matters as are required to be discussed under applicable auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). The Audit Committee has received and reviewed with KPMG the written disclosures and letter regarding their independence required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with KPMG their independence from management and the Company, and considered whether the non-audit services provided by KPMG to the Company are compatible with maintaining KPMG's independence. 
                The Company also has an internal audit department that reports to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the internal audit plan once a year and receives updates of internal audit results throughout the year. The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and KPMG the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the internal auditors and KPMG to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
                The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and KPMG the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met independently with the internal auditors and KPMG, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's system of internal control and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting practices, which included, but were not limited to, the review of the quarterly Form 10-Q filings and annual Form 10-K filing. 
                In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee approved the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended. The Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm and has asked the stockholders to ratify the selection. 
                The Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material, and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the Report of the Audit Committee by reference therein.

      Nomination of director candidates         
                Under our bylaws, if a stockholder plans to directly nominate a person as a director at an annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholder is required to place the proposed director's name in nomination by written request received by our Corporate Secretary not earlier than July 17, 2019 (120 days prior to November 14, 2019, the one year anniversary of the Annual Meeting), nor later than August 16, 2019 (90 days prior to November 14, 2019); provided, however that in the event that less than one hundred (100) days' notice or prior Public Announcement of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to stockholders, the Notice must be received by the Company's Secretary by not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date the annual meeting was mailed. The notice must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, as well as certain other provisions contained in our bylaws, which generally require the stockholder to provide certain information about the proposed director, the stockholder and the Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. securities held by the stockholder. 
                In addition, our bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a stockholder or group of stockholders may include director candidates that they have nominated in our proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders. These proxy access provisions of our bylaws provide, among other things, that a stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders seeking to include their director candidates in our proxy statement must own 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least the previous three years. The number of stockholder-nominated candidates appearing in any proxy statement cannot exceed 20% of the number of directors then serving on the Board, but may be at least two directors. If 20% is not a whole number, the maximum number of stockholder-nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. Based on the current Board size of seven directors, the maximum number of proxy access candidates that we would be required to include in our proxy statement is two. Nominees submitted under the proxy access procedures that are later withdrawn or are included in the proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates will be counted in determining whether the 20% maximum has been reached. If the number of stockholder nominated candidates exceeds 20%, each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders may select one nominee for inclusion in the proxy materials until the maximum number is reached. The order of selection would be determined by the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. common stock held by each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders.

                The discussion of financial results includes references to the Company's consolidated operating income and net income, all excluding the effects of certain costs. A reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") is provided above. 
                Management believes that excluding items which are deemed to be non-recurring in nature from financial measures such as operating income, net income, and earnings per share, allows investors to more easily compare and evaluate the Company's financial performance relative to prior periods and industry comparables. These adjusted measures also aid investors in understanding the operating results of the Company absent such non-recurring or unusual events.
