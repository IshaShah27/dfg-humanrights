We have adopted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Internet Availability Notice") to most of our stockholders instead of a paper copy of this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report. The Internet Availability Notice contains instructions on how to access and review those documents over the Internet. We believe that this process allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need in a more timely manner, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. If you received an Internet Availability Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Internet Availability Notice. 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting (in person or virtually via the Internet), please complete and return your proxy card or vote by telephone or via the Internet by following the instructions on your Internet Availability Notice. Returning a proxy card or otherwise submitting your proxy does not deprive you of your right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person or virtually via the Internet. Proxies are being solicited on behalf of the board of directors. 
By Order of the Board of Directors

[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (the "Company"). The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, February 13, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Standard Time, at the Company's corporate headquarters, 200 South 108th Avenue, Omaha, Nebraska and via the Internet at amtd.onlineshareholdermeeting.com, where you will be able to vote electronically and submit questions during the meeting. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card are first being sent to stockholders on or about December 31, 2018. 
Quorum and Voting Requirements 
The Company has one class of common stock. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote upon each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 561,142,554 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
This Proxy Statement relates only to the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders with respect to the election of four Class II directors recommended by the board of directors, an advisory vote to approve executive compensation and ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. All shares of the Company's common stock represented by properly executed and unrevoked proxies will be voted by the persons named as proxies in accordance with the directions given. Where no instructions are indicated on any such proxy, properly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement for consideration at the Annual Meeting. At this time, we are unaware of any matters, other than those described above in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. If any other matters come before the Annual Meeting, the proxies in the enclosed form will confer discretionary authority on the persons named as proxies to vote in their discretion with respect to such matters. 
The accompanying proxy is solicited from the holders of the Company's common stock on behalf of the board of directors of the Company. A proxy is revocable at any time by giving written notice of revocation to the secretary of the Company prior to the Annual Meeting or by executing and delivering a later-dated proxy via the Internet, telephone or mail prior to the Annual Meeting. Furthermore, the stockholders who are present at the Annual Meeting (in person or via the Internet) may revoke their proxies and vote in person. Stockholders attending the Annual Meeting via the Internet should follow the instructions at amtd.onlineshareholdermeeting.com in order to vote at the meeting. 
A quorum consisting of at least a majority of shares of common stock issued and outstanding must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted. Shares of common stock entitled to vote and represented by properly executed, returned and unrevoked proxies, including shares with respect to which votes are withheld or abstentions are cast or shares that are "broker non-votes," will be considered present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers or nominees for which voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote those shares and for which the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power under rules applicable to broker-dealers. If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will nevertheless have discretion to vote your shares on our sole "routine" matter – the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Your broker will not have discretion to vote on the following "non-routine" matters absent direction from you: the election of directors recommended by the board of directors and the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. 
Voting Electronically 
In order to vote online or via telephone before the Annual Meeting, go to the www.proxyvote.com website or call the toll-free number on the proxy card or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Internet Availability Notice") and follow the instructions. If you choose not to vote by telephone or electronically, please complete and return the proxy card in the pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided. You may also vote while attending the meeting on the Internet. If you received an Internet Availability Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Internet Availability Notice. If you would like to receive future stockholder materials electronically, please enroll at http://enroll.icsdelivery.com/AMTD. Please have the proxy card you received available when accessing the site.

       Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
       Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
[END TABLE]
Board of Directors 
The Company's certificate of incorporation divides the Company's board of directors into three classes. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors with each class being elected to a staggered three-year term. The Toronto-Dominion Bank, a Canadian chartered bank, owned approximately 42% of our common stock as of the Record Date. References to "TD" or "TD Bank Group" in this Proxy Statement refer to The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries. In connection with the Company's January 24, 2006 acquisition of TD Waterhouse Group, Inc. ("TD Waterhouse"), the Company entered into a stockholders agreement, as amended (the "Stockholders Agreement"). 
Under the Stockholders Agreement, the Company's board of directors consists of twelve members, up to five of whom may be designated by TD, one of whom is the Company's chief executive officer ("CEO"), and the remainder of whom are outside independent directors who are nominated by the Outside Independent Directors Committee ("OID Committee") and subject to consent by TD not to be unreasonably withheld. The right of TD to designate directors is subject to its maintaining specified ownership thresholds of Company common stock, as set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. As of the Record Date, based on its ownership position in the Company, TD has the right to designate five members of the board of directors. See discussion under "Stock Ownership and Related Information – Stockholders Agreement" for additional information regarding the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. The board of directors has nominated the following persons as directors to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting: Bharat B. Masrani, Irene R. Miller, Todd M. Ricketts and Allan R. Tessler, as Class II directors to serve terms ending at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Masrani and Ms. Miller are designees of TD. Messrs. Ricketts and Tessler are outside independent directors. Lorenzo A. Bettino, V. Ann Hailey, Joseph H. Moglia and Wilbur J. Prezzano are Class III directors serving terms ending at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Tim Hockey, Brian M. Levitt, Karen E. Maidment and Mark L. Mitchell are Class I directors serving terms ending at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. The board of directors has determined that Mses. Hailey, Maidment and Miller and Messrs. Bettino, Levitt, Mitchell, Moglia, Prezzano, Ricketts and Tessler are independent as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5605. 
The board of directors knows of no reason why any of Messrs. Masrani, Ricketts and Tessler and Ms. Miller might be unavailable to serve as directors, and each has expressed an intention to serve if elected. If any of Messrs. Masrani, Ricketts and Tessler and Ms. Miller is unable to serve, the shares represented by all valid proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as the board of directors may recommend. With the exception of the Stockholders Agreement, there are no arrangements or understandings between any of the persons nominated to be a Class II director and any other person pursuant to which any of such nominees was selected. The election of a director requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and voting, provided a quorum of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is represented at the meeting. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your abstention will have no effect on the vote. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker how to vote on this "non-routine" proposal, your broker does not have authority to vote your shares. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not have any other effect on the outcome of the election of directors. Where no instructions are indicated, properly executed and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of each of Messrs. Masrani, Ricketts and Tessler and Ms. Miller as Class II directors.

Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
Board Meetings and Committees 
The board of directors conducts its business through meetings of the board, actions taken by written consent in lieu of meetings and by the actions of its committees. The non-employee members and the independent members of our board of directors regularly meet in executive session without management present. These directors select a presiding director at these meetings on an ad-hoc basis. The board of directors has a policy requiring the separation of the roles of CEO and chairman of the board because the board of directors believes it improves the ability of the board to exercise its oversight role. Mr. Hockey serves as the CEO, with primary responsibility for operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company. Mr. Moglia serves as chairman of the board, facilitating the board's oversight of management, promoting communication between management and the board and engaging with shareholders. Key responsibilities of the chairman include: setting the agenda for board meetings in consultation with other directors, the CEO, and the corporate secretary, facilitating the annual CEO performance evaluation, serving as a liaison between the board and senior management, conducting annual board interviews as part of the annual board evaluation process and setting and maintaining board culture. The separation of the roles of CEO and chairman of the board does not affect risk oversight, which is the responsibility of the board of directors, primarily overseen by the Risk Committee. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the board of directors held fourteen meetings. During fiscal year 2018, each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board of directors and meetings of the committees of the board of directors on which he or she served during the period in which he or she served, if any. Although the Company does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders, directors are encouraged to attend. All directors of the Company at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
The board of directors has established six standing committees: Audit, H.R. and Compensation, Corporate Governance, Outside Independent Directors, Non-TD Directors and Risk. The committee members are identified in the following table:

Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
Audit Committee. The functions performed by the Audit Committee are described in the Audit Committee charter and include: (1) overseeing the Company's internal accounting controls and controls over financial reporting, including assessment of legal and compliance matters, (2) appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing the appointment of the Managing Director, General Auditor and assessing their performance on an ongoing basis, (3) reviewing the Company's financial statements and audit issues and overseeing the financial and regulatory reporting processes and related risks, (4) performing other oversight functions as requested by the board of directors and (5) reporting its activities to the board of directors. The Audit Committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.amtd.com under the governance section. All current Audit Committee members are independent as defined in the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The board of directors has determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and auditing matters to serve on the committee and has designated Mses. Maidment, Hailey, and Miller, and Mr. Bettino as audit committee financial experts as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Company's Audit Committee met 10 times during fiscal year 2018. The Report of the Audit Committee for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 appears under Proposal No. 3 – "Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm." 
H.R. and Compensation Committee. The H.R. and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") reviews and approves broad compensation philosophy and policy and executive salary levels, bonus payments and equity awards pursuant to the Company's management incentive plans and, in consultation with the Risk Committee, reviews compensation-related risks. The Compensation Committee also reviews the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, discusses it with management and makes a recommendation as to whether it should be included in each proxy statement. The Compensation Committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.amtd.com under the governance section. All current Compensation Committee members are independent as defined in the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Compensation Committee met five times during fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee Report appears under "Executive Compensation and Related Information." 
Corporate Governance Committee. The primary purpose of the Corporate Governance Committee is to ensure that the Company has and follows appropriate governance standards. To carry out this purpose, the committee develops and recommends to the board of directors corporate governance principles and leads and oversees the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors and its committees. The Corporate Governance Committee also makes recommendations to the board of directors regarding compensation for non-employee directors by annually reviewing the market practice for non-employee director compensation for companies in its peer group, which this year was accomplished in consultation with Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy"), the independent compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee, who assessed whether the Company's non-employee director compensation program continues to be competitive with the market for qualified directors, incorporates best practices and aligns the interests of our non-employee directors with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Company's Corporate Governance Committee met four times during fiscal year 2018. The Corporate Governance Committee charter and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Company's website at www.amtd.com under the governance section. 
Outside Independent Directors Committee. The OID Committee's purpose is to assist the board of directors in fulfilling the board's oversight responsibilities by: (1) identifying individuals qualified to serve on the board of directors, (2) reviewing the qualifications of the members of the board and recommending nominees to fill board of director vacancies and (3) recommending a slate of nominees for election or reelection as directors by the Company's stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders to fill the seats of directors whose terms are expiring. The OID Committee reviews and approves (or ratifies) any related person transaction that is required to be disclosed by the Company. The OID Committee is also responsible for approving transfers of voting securities by TD that are not otherwise permitted by the Stockholders Agreement, approving qualifying transactions (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) and determining the fair market value (or selecting an independent investment banking firm to determine the fair market value) of certain property in connection with the stock purchase and transfer rights of TD set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. All current OID Committee members are independent as defined in the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company's OID Committee met seven times during fiscal year 2018. 
Written communications submitted by stockholders pursuant to the Company's Stockholder Communications Policy recommending the nomination of a person to be a member of the Company's board of directors will be forwarded to the chair of the OID Committee for consideration. The OID Committee will consider director candidates who have been identified by other directors or the Company's stockholders, but it has no obligation to recommend such candidates for nomination, except as may be required by contractual obligation of the Company. Stockholders who submit director recommendations must include the following: (1) a detailed resume outlining the candidate's knowledge, skills and experience, (2) a one-page summary of the candidate's attributes, including a statement as to why the candidate is an excellent choice for the board of directors, (3) a detailed resume of the stockholder submitting the director recommendation and (4) the number of shares held by the stockholder, including the dates such shares were acquired. 
Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
The OID Committee charter establishes the following guidelines for identifying and evaluating candidates for selection to the board of directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Decisions for recommending candidates for nomination are based on merit, qualifications, performance, character and  integrity and the Company's business needs and will comply with the Company's anti-discrimination policies and federal, state and local laws.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  The composition of the entire board of directors will be taken into account when evaluating individual directors,  including: the diversity, depth and breadth of knowledge, skills, experience and background represented on the board of directors; the need for financial, business, financial industry, public company and other experience and expertise on the board  of directors and its committees; and the need to have directors work cooperatively to further the interests of the Company and its stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Candidates will be free of conflicts of interest that would interfere with their ability to discharge their duties as a  director.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Candidates will be willing and able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as a director and shall have  the desire and purpose to represent and advance the interests of the Company and stockholders as a whole.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  Any other criteria as the OID Committee may determine.  
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the OID Committee charter, when the Company is legally required by contractual obligation to provide third parties with the ability to nominate directors (including pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, discussed under "Stock Ownership and Related Information – Stockholders Agreement"), the selection and nomination of such directors is not subject to the committee's review and recommendation process. The OID Committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.amtd.com under the governance section. 
Non-TD Directors Committee. The Non-TD Directors Committee is composed of all of the directors not designated by TD.

The Non-TD Directors Committee did not meet during fiscal year 2018. 
Risk Committee. The Risk Committee was formed for the purpose of assisting the board of directors in its oversight responsibilities relating to the identification, monitoring and assessment of the key risks of the Company, including the significant policies, procedures and practices employed in risk management.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Please see "Changes for Calendar Year 2019" below for a description of compensation changes for calendar year  2019.  
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors may also receive, at the discretion of the Corporate Governance Committee and approved by the board of directors, payment of additional non-employee director compensation when special circumstances warrant. No additional non-employee director compensation was paid in calendar year 2018. 
2006 Directors Incentive Plan 
The 2006 Directors Incentive Plan is designed to: 
The annual cash retainer, the committee chair and membership fees are paid in advance at the beginning of each calendar year. 
Under the 2006 Directors Incentive Plan, any non-employee director is permitted to defer any or all of the cash or equity award. Investment earnings on amounts deferred in the form of stock units are based on the fluctuations in the underlying common stock of the Company. Deferred cash awards earn interest at the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal. 
The number of restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the annual equity grant is calculated by using the average of the high and low price of the Company's common stock for the 20 trading days prior to the grant date. RSU awards vest completely on the first anniversary of the grant date and are settled by issuing one share of Company common stock for each RSU granted. RSUs do not have any voting rights. RSUs receive the benefit of any dividends on common stock of the Company in the form of additional dividend equivalent units ("DEUs") that are subject to the same vesting schedule as the original RSUs on which the dividends are paid. In the event of the death or disability of a non-employee director or a change in control of the Company, the RSUs will vest and be settled in common stock of the Company. 
Non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attending meetings of the board of directors. The Company also indemnifies and provides liability insurance for its directors and officers. 
Chairman Compensation 
For calendar year 2018, Mr. Moglia was compensated pursuant to a non-employee chairman term sheet. Under the term sheet, Mr. Moglia earns an annual retainer of $400,000, which is paid in either cash or a combination of cash and equity as agreed upon between Mr. Moglia and the board of directors. The term sheet also provides for administrative support equivalent to that provided to a senior executive including secretarial assistance, office, and certain other equipment. Mr. Moglia's 2018 annual retainer was paid in cash. For the provisions of the non-employee chairman term sheet, see Exhibit 10.2 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 18, 2011. 
As part of the annual review of director compensation, the Corporate Governance Committee asked Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, to review Mr. Moglia's compensation in his role as chairman. Semler Brossy's review found that Mr. Moglia's compensation was consistent generally with the median compensation for non-executive chairman within our fiscal year 2018 peer group. (For more information on our peer group, refer to p. 23.) The Corporate Governance Committee considered the data provided by Semler Brossy, as well as Mr. Moglia's responsibilities as chairman of the board of directors (including serving as a liaison between the board and senior management and conducting annual board interviews as part of the annual board evaluation process) and his unique insight and experience as our former chief executive officer. In light of this review, the Corporate Governance Committee continues to believe that the annual retainer amount is appropriate and made no changes to the calendar year 2019 retainer amount. For a description of changes to the form of payment of Mr. Moglia's retainer for calendar year 2019, please see "Changes for Calendar Year 2019" below. 
Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors Recommended by the Board of Directors 
Changes for Calendar Year 2019 
As part of its annual review of director compensation, the Corporate Governance Committee requested that Semler Brossy conduct an independent review of the Company's non-employee director compensation program. Semler Brossy conducted an in-depth assessment of each element of compensation and of the compensation program structure in comparison to the companies in the fiscal year 2018 peer group used for executive compensation purposes. Semler Brossy's review found that the cash compensation paid to our non-employee directors was consistent generally with the median paid in our peer group, but the amount of our equity retainer was below the fiscal year 2018 peer group median. The amount of equity retainer had not been increased since 2010. Following the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, on November 16, 2018, the board of directors approved a $15,000 increase in the annual equity retainer for our non-employee directors (other than the chairman), from $130,000 to $145,000. This increase resulted in bringing the annual equity retainer to approximately the peer group median. There were no other changes to the terms of the compensation for non-employee directors, including no changes to vesting, proration and deferral. 
As noted above, Mr. Moglia is compensated pursuant to a non-employee chairman term sheet that provides for payment of his annual retainer in either cash or a combination of cash and equity as agreed upon between Mr. Moglia and the board of directors. For calendar year 2019, Mr. Moglia will receive 50% of his annual retainer in cash and 50% in the form of RSUs. The total amount of the annual retainer was not changed. Consistent with the RSUs granted to other non-employee directors, Mr. Moglia's RSUs will be scheduled to vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to his continued service as a director through the vesting date.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary 
Named Executive Officers 
This section is an executive summary of fiscal year 2018 compensation for our CEO, our chief financial officer ("CFO") and each of our other three most highly compensated executive officers employed at the end of fiscal year 2018. We refer to these individuals as our named executive officers. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 were: 
Executive Compensation Program Highlights for Fiscal Year 2018 
Consistent with the Company's executive compensation principles and strong commitment to pay for performance, the majority of our named executive officers' fiscal year 2018 total compensation package required achievement of performance objectives set by the Compensation Committee before the compensation could be earned and paid. Further, any equity awards that were granted upon meeting these performance objectives are subject to multi-year, service-based vesting, with additional performance objectives related to the Company's three-year total shareholder return ("TSR") as compared to the components of the New York Stock Exchange Archipelago ("NYSE Arca") Securities Broker/Dealer Index that can result in adjustments to the awards up or down 20% depending on performance achievement. 
At the Company's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the compensation of the fiscal year 2017 named executive officers was approved on a non-binding advisory basis with more than 99% of the total votes cast voting in favor of the say-on-pay proposal. The previous year's stockholder advisory vote yielded more than 98% of total votes cast voting in favor of the say-on-pay proposal. In overseeing our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee also takes into account the views of stockholders as expressed directly to the Company. Our investor relations department engages directly with institutional stockholders to understand their priorities and concerns. After considering the results of the stockholder advisory votes, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same general approach with respect to the Company's executive compensation program for fiscal year 2018. 
Our CEO's and other named executive executives' targeted total annual compensation (i.e., base salary, target cash incentive and target equity incentive) for fiscal year 2018 was heavily weighted toward elements that were subject to performance objectives: 
Fiscal Year 2018 Named Executive Officer 
Target Total Annual Compensation(1) 
Base salaryTarget cash incentiveTarget equity incentive 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Target cash incentive and target equity incentive are amounts as established by the Compensation Committee based on  performance under the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP") during fiscal year 2018. Any equity awards under the fiscal year 2018 MIP were granted following the completion of the fiscal year 2018 performance period, in early fiscal year 2019.  These elements required achievement of performance goals before they could be paid or granted.  
[END TABLE]

(2)  Each element of compensation comprising the target total annual compensation for the named executive officers, other than  the CEO, is based on the average among the named executive officers (other than Mr. Hockey).

Key Performance Highlights and Pay for Performance Results for Fiscal Year 2018 
In fiscal year 2018, the Company demonstrated strong performance in its businesses, with core operating metrics at record levels, driven by strong organic growth and the successful integration of Scottrade. 
Results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net new client assets of approximately $92 billion, a growth rate of 8 percent  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record average client trades per day of approximately 811,000, up 59 percent year over year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• $2.59 in GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 58 percent year over year, on net income of $1.47 billion   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• $3.34 in Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 82 percent year over year. For  a discussion of this measure and a reconciliation to the related GAAP measure, refer to Appendix A  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The successful integration of Scottrade  
[END TABLE]
The Company's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), an important measure of our financial performance, weighted at 60% of the corporate performance metrics under the MIP, was adjusted downward by the Compensation Committee to $2.63 (from $3.34) to account for changes to tax laws and unplanned increases in interest rates. The Compensation Committee determined that these items were outside the control of the Company and therefore it was appropriate to make the downward adjustment to better reflect the results delivered to stockholders and preserve the intent of the pre-established performance goals, which were set before the occurrence of these unplanned events. The adjusted non-GAAP EPS performance of $2.63 exceeded the pre-established target of $2.24. The Company also overachieved on market share of client revenue trades and net new client assets, which when combined with the firm's qualitative strategic goals, comprise the other 40% of the corporate performance metrics under the MIP. Based on these results and consistent with our executive compensation program's pay-for-performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee approved annual incentive awards under the MIP of between 135.9% and 140.9% of the target incentive opportunity for our named executive officers, after adjustments were made to reflect individual performance.

[END TABLE]
1.    Role of the Compensation Committee and Board 
The Compensation Committee is composed of non-employee directors of the board. No member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries at the time of his service on the Compensation Committee. Each member of the Compensation 
 Committee during fiscal year 2018 was intended to qualify as a "non-employee director" under rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and as an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code"). 
The Compensation Committee reviews, assesses and approves all compensation and benefits for executive officers and, in consultation with the Risk Committee, reviews compensation-related risks. The board of directors evaluates the performance of the CEO and reviews and provides input on the Compensation Committee's compensation recommendation. The Compensation Committee then approves the CEO's compensation. The CEO and the Compensation Committee together assess the performance of each of the other named executive officers and then the Compensation Committee approves final recommendations from the CEO. 
2.    Role of Compensation Consultants and Management 
Beginning in May 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in its oversight of the design and operation of the Company's executive compensation programs. Semler Brossy advised the Compensation Committee on best practices for executive compensation and governance, among other activities.

For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee was guided by the data collected on the above peer group in establishing the base salaries and target annual incentive amounts for our named executive officers. No changes to the companies comprising the peer group were made for fiscal year 2018 as compared to those for fiscal year 2017. 
For fiscal year 2019, the Committee requested that Semler Brossy conduct an independent review of the peer group. The criteria for reviewing and determining the companies comprising the peer group for fiscal year 2019 were industry, market capitalization, revenue, geography, organizational complexity and competition for talent. Based on this review, SEI Investments and Stifel Financial Corporation were added to the peer group and Comerica Incorporated and Fifth Third Bancorp were removed, effective November 2018. The Compensation Committee agreed with Semler Brossy's assessment that the two companies that were removed, as regional banks, were not as well-aligned with the Company's businesses; the two additions were chosen for having relatively stronger business alignment with the Company. As part its review, Semler Brossy also presented to the Compensation Committee the lists of companies comprising peer groups identified by proxy advisors with respect to the Company and public companies that include the Company in their peer groups. The peer group was updated as part of the process for considering the fiscal year 2019 executive compensation program.

5.    Elements of Compensation 
Target Total Compensation 
Target total annual compensation consists of: (1) base salary and (2) incentive compensation, which is comprised of cash and equity. Each of these elements of compensation, as well as the compensation package as a whole, is intended to enable the Company to remain competitive in attracting and retaining talented individuals. While base salaries are provided to reward executives on a day-to-day basis for their time and services, the incentive compensation links the executives' compensation to the achievement of the Company's business strategy and stockholders' interests. For fiscal year 2018 compensation, these target total compensation levels were developed using market data from our peer group and other financial services compensation data obtained from human resources consulting firms, such as McLagan, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson. The market data considered as part of the competitive review reflect executive responsibilities that were similar to the responsibilities of our executive officers, where available. While the Compensation 
Executive Compensation and Related Information 
 Committee did not target a specific percentile or otherwise benchmark any key elements of the named executive officers' compensation to the market data, it did review a range of market data and generally compared compensation to the market median. During fiscal year 2018, Semler Brossy reviewed the market compensation information prepared by management and confirmed the market data as an appropriate point of reference in setting target total compensation for fiscal year 2019. 
A significant portion of each executive's target total compensation is performance-based or "at risk." The "at risk" portion includes the annual cash incentive and the annual equity incentive, which are both linked to performance during the year. If the Company's or individual's performance is below target, "at risk" compensation may decrease. Conversely, if the Company's or individual's performance is above target, "at risk" compensation may increase. 
The equity incentive compensation target is established so that a meaningful portion of total compensation is awarded as equity that vests in full on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued service with us and depending in part on achievement of additional performance objectives based on relative TSR. The target mix between cash and equity is based on target total compensation level, with the portion that is awarded as equity generally increasing as target total compensation increases. This practice, combined with stock ownership guidelines, promotes retention and focuses executives on executing business strategies, sustaining performance and growing value for stockholders over the long term. 
Each named executive officer had target total annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 as follows:

Executive Compensation and Related Information executive officers, 50% of their incentive is paid in cash and 50% is paid in equity. 
Annual Incentive Award under the MIP 
Our annual incentive plan, reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee, supports our pay-for-performance philosophy, with the objective of driving the business strategy for which each executive is most responsible and which is critical for sustaining the long-term growth of the Company. Through the equity component of the plan, we promote closer alignment of each executive's interests to the long-term growth of the Company. Based on pre-established targets for non-GAAP EPS and quantitative and qualitative strategic goals, the Compensation Committee believes that the design provides for a balanced assessment of short- and long-term performance. 
In fiscal year 2018, the first step for calculating awards under the annual incentive plan for executive officers was based on the achievement of goals for the following key metrics: (1) non-GAAP EPS, (2) market share of client revenue trades among the Company's primary publicly-traded competitors and (3) net new client assets. These goals were initially recommended by the CEO and established and approved by the Compensation Committee, as the Compensation Committee determined that these goals are important metrics for assessing the Company's business success and would help to align the interests of executives more closely with those of our stockholders. We refer to market share of client revenue trades and net new client assets as the quantitative strategic goals. In addition, the following factors were considered in determining the annual incentive awards of our executive officers: 
The Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce the payouts initially determined by the achievement of non-GAAP EPS and quantitative strategic goals. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains the ability to exercise further negative discretion to reduce or eliminate incentive payments to executives. 
A portion of the annual incentive award is granted in equity under the LTIP. Equity awards are used to motivate, reward and retain key executives and to align their interests more closely to those of stockholders. Equity awards are granted under the annual incentive plan only if the pre-established performance measures under the annual incentive plan have been achieved. For fiscal year 2018, equity incentives were granted solely in the form of performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"). As described below under "Fiscal Year 2018 MIP Incentive Funding Formula," equity incentives may be funded between 0% and 200% of target. After the equity incentive has been granted, the PRSUs are then subject to a three-year cliff vesting period and may be further adjusted up or down 20% based on the Company's cumulative three-year TSR relative to the components of the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index determined at the time of grant. This equity incentive design further aligns the long-term interests of executives with those of our stockholders. PRSU awards are automatically increased by the number of units equivalent to the value of any cash dividends paid while the awards are outstanding (based on the target amount of the award). DEUs are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying award. The vesting of PRSU awards may accelerate upon certain events, as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" later in this section. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the clear performance measures and specific targets used by the Company ensure a strong, team-oriented, pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Executive Compensation and Related Information 
Fiscal Year 2018 MIP Incentive Funding Formula 
For fiscal year 2018, 60% of the initial measurement of results under the annual incentive plan was based on non-GAAP EPS, a key measure of the Company's short-term financial performance. The remaining 40% was based on the two quantitative strategic goals of market share of client revenue trades among the Company's primary publicly traded competitors (16%) and net new client assets (24%). The quantitative strategic goals result was then adjusted downward to additionally reflect the attainment of the qualitative strategic goals, which include successfully integrating Scottrade, improving the client experience, accelerating and diversifying revenue growth, increasing organizational agility and efficiency, associate development, and increased competitiveness through innovation. Both the quantitative and qualitative strategic goals impact the Company's long-term financial performance and support its long-term strategy. These metrics are all intended to incentivize management to drive Company performance in alignment with long-term stockholder interests. The quantitative performance goals and corresponding funding percentages for each of these measures are summarized below:

(2)  Actual results for non-GAAP EPS were adjusted downward by the Compensation  Committee from $3.34 to $2.63 to account for changes to tax laws and unplanned changes to interest rates, which the Compensation Committee determined were outside the control of the Company and appropriate to reflect the results delivered to  stockholders and preserve the intent of the pre-established performance goals (which were set before the occurrence of the unplanned changes).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The Compensation Committee applied 15.9% negative discretion to reduce the funding otherwise achieved by the quantitative  strategic goals to reflect the performance assessment of the strategic goals overall.  
[END TABLE]
In determining the negative discretion to be applied, the Compensation Committee noted the record performance on the quantitative goals, weighed them against qualitative performance goals, and established a maximum individual payout percentage of 155.9% for each of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee then used its judgment to measure the individual performance of each of the named executive officers in order to determine the amount of any additional negative discretion to apply. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee varied the negative discretion applied for individual performance in order to recognize significant contributions during fiscal year 2018 and emphasize individual responsibilities and roles. The additional negative discretion ranged from 15.0% to 20.0% based on the Compensation Committee's assessment, and the CEO's review and recommendation with respect to the named executive officers other than himself. Consistent with the Company's pay for performance philosophy, this result reflects a very strong year which included the successful integration of Scottrade and record core operating metrics. 
The equity component of the fiscal year 2018 annual incentive awards for the named executive officers was granted solely in the form of PRSUs. As described above, the equity incentive awards are subject to a three-year cliff vesting period and may be further adjusted up or down 20% based on the Company's cumulative three-year TSR relative to the components of the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index determined at the time of grant.

 equity agreements permit the clawback of awards granted pursuant to the MIP and LTIP if the Compensation Committee determines, within three years of the grant date of the award, that certain conduct has occurred. Generally, under the terms of the clawback policy, an executive who is involved in fraud or willful misconduct that results in a restatement of the Company's financial statements or who commits an act of fraud, negligence or breach of fiduciary duty resulting in material loss, damage or injury to the Company can be required to: (1) forfeit and transfer to the Company, at no cost to the Company, any unvested equity awards and any shares of common stock issued in connection with vested equity awards and (2) repay to the Company any cash incentive awarded under the MIP or any gain realized from the disposition of any such shares of common stock awarded under the LTIP. 
7.    Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee, together with the Risk Committee, assessed the Company's incentive compensation plans and concluded that our compensation plans and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Management assessed all of the Company's executive, sales and broad-based compensation plans to determine if any provisions or practices create undesired or unintentional risk of a material nature. This risk assessment process included a review of plan design, including business drivers and performance measures. Incentive compensation plan design varies across business units based on differing goals established for business units. Incentive compensation targets are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to align with quantitative and qualitative strategic goals (discussed above). 
8.    Stock Ownership Guidelines and Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
The Compensation Committee and the board of directors strongly believe that senior executives should own a significant amount of Company common stock. This provides a direct and continuing alignment of financial interests between executives and stockholders. 
The stock ownership guidelines for the named executive officers are as follows: 
None of these executive officers are permitted to sell any equity interest in the Company until they meet their respective stock ownership guidelines, after which the CEO must obtain prior approval from the Compensation Committee and all other senior executives must obtain prior approval from the CEO. The Company considers any stock held without restrictions, unvested 
 RSUs and PRSUs, vested but unexercised in-the-money stock options, deferred compensation that will settle in common stock and common stock held under the Company's 401(k) plan in determining whether the stock ownership guidelines have been met. All current named executive officers, with the exception of Mr. deSilva, who joined the company in September 2017, have met the stock ownership guidelines as of the end of fiscal year 2018. 
The Company prohibits any of its employees from entering into hedging or pledging transactions involving its common stock. 
9.    Change in Control and Severance Provisions 
Our senior executive team has been instrumental to the success of the Company, and we believe it is important to provide certain benefits to them in the event of a change in control. We believe that the interests of our stockholders are best served if the interests of senior management are closely aligned with them, and providing change in control benefits should minimize any reluctance of senior management to pursue change in control transactions that may be in the best interest of our stockholders. Equity awards under the MIP generally will vest upon certain qualifying terminations of employment by the Company within a specified period after a change in control. Our executive officers are not automatically entitled to any single-trigger bonuses, vesting acceleration, or other payouts upon a change in control. Rather, our employment arrangement with Mr. Hockey and our executive compensation practices (described later in this section under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control") require a termination of employment under specified circumstances in connection with or following a change in control for any benefits to apply. We utilize this dual-trigger change in control provision because we believe that triggering severance or bonus payments simply because a change in control has occurred is not in the Company's or stockholders' best interests. 
10.    Tax Treatment 
In determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the possible tax consequences to the Company and to its executives. To maintain maximum flexibility in designing compensation programs, the Compensation Committee, while considering tax deductibility as one of its factors in determining compensation, will not limit compensation to those levels or types of compensation that are intended to be deductible. 
Certain compensation previously paid to executive officers under the MIP, and certain equity awards that previously vested, were and are intended to be fully deductible under the "performance-based" compensation exception (discussed below) previously provided by Section 162(m) of the Code. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act"), for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code limits to 
Executive Compensation and Related Information 
 $1 million the federal income tax deduction we can receive for annual individual compensation paid to certain current and former executive officers, subject to a transition rule for written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, and not materially modified after that date. Prior to the Act, Section 162(m)'s deduction limit included an exception for "performance-based" compensation that permitted qualifying compensation to be deductible even if it exceeded the $1 million limit. Significant aspects of the Company's compensation programs were designed to permit (but not require) compensation to qualify for this performance-based exception. To accomplish this, the Company previously asked shareholders to approve equity and incentive compensation plans that included limitations and provisions required to be included under Section 162(m). Now that the performance-based compensation exception is no longer available, the Company will no longer include specific Section 162(m)-related limitations or provisions or request shareholder approval for this purpose, and generally will not attempt to meet the requirements previously included in our plans related to the now eliminated performance-based exception as there is no tax benefit from doing so. The Company will continue to seek shareholder approval of certain compensation plans as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

Fiscal Year 2019 MIP Incentive Funding Formula 
In light of the recent changes to Section 162(m) of the Code, and in consultation with Semler Brossy following review of the Company's executive compensation programs, effective for fiscal year 2019, the incentive funding formula under the MIP for fiscal year 2018 will be replaced with the design illustrated below. 
FY 2019 Incentive Funding Design Incentive Funding Components Component Weightings CEO NEO Potential Funding Range Corporate Performance 80% 70%0%, 50% - 150% Individual Performance20%30%0%, 50% - 150% Total Individual Incentive Funding Percentage:0% - 150%  Corporate Performance Formula Metric Weighting Potential Funding Range Earnings Per Share 40% 0%, 50% - 150% Client Experience 25% 0%, 50% - 150% Revenue & Market Share 20% 0%, 50% - 150% Other Strategic Themes 15% 0%, 50% - 150% Corporate Performance Total 100% 0% - 150% 
The fiscal year 2019 incentive funding formula emphasizes key, short-term, quantitative results and further supports the delivery of a superior client experience. The new design is intended to emphasize areas that the Compensation Committee believes are critical drivers of the Company's strategic and financial success over the longer-term (client experience and key strategic themes) and measures of the Company's short-term operational success (non-GAAP EPS, revenue and market share). Equity incentives will continue to be delivered 100% in the form of PRSUs, which may be adjusted up or down by up to 20% based on the Company's cumulative three-year TSR relative to the components of the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index determined at the time of grant and which also are subject to three-year cliff vesting based on continued service with us.

Mr. Boyle previously deferred 50% of the cash component of his annual incentive award  payable to him under the MIP for fiscal year 2016, which was converted into 10,334 deferred stock units. An amount of $342,900, representing the deferred portion of the annual incentive award payable in cash to Mr. Boyle under the MIP for  fiscal year 2016 was included in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal year 2016 under the column titled Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. These deferred stock units are subject to the Company's  Executive Deferred Compensation Program. Under this program, participants may elect to defer up to 100% of their annual incentive earned under the MIP or such other compensation that the program administrator may permit. The program also permits  discretionary contributions by the Company, although no Company contributions were made in fiscal year 2018. Deferred stock units under the program are eligible for DEUs, which generally are calculated by multiplying the dividend amount per share by  the number of deferred stock units of the participant, divided by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the dividend payment date. The program will provide for earlier, lump sum distribution in the event that Mr. Boyle becomes  disabled while employed with the Company, and also permits distributions in connection with an unforeseeable emergency.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Introduction and Overview 
The Company has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Hockey, Boyle and deSilva. Messrs. Nally and Quirk do not have employment agreements. The employment agreements and certain compensation plans and award agreements require the Company to provide compensation and benefits to the executives in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment, including in connection with a change in control of the Company. Payments are not triggered automatically upon the occurrence of a change in control. Rather, our executives will receive change in control benefits only if their employment is terminated in certain instances following a change in control. 
Compensation Plans and Award Agreements 
Management Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan 
Under the MIP, in the event of death or disability prior to the payment of a scheduled award, compensation will be paid to the executive's estate or other authorized person. The LTIP provides that in the event of a change in control, unless determined otherwise by the administrator of the LTIP, in the event a successor to the Company does not assume or substitute or replace outstanding awards of options, RSUs and PRSUs, those awards will vest in full. The RSU and PRSU award agreements generally provide for settlement as soon as practicable upon the vesting of the award, except in limited circumstances for purposes of complying with any applicable laws (such as requirements relating to deferred compensation). The option, RSU and PRSU award agreements provide for the following treatment of named executive officers' awards upon death, disability, retirement, termination without cause, resignation for good reason, and change in control:

SAR Award Agreement 
Mr. deSilva entered into a SAR award agreement dated January 1, 2016 with Scottrade (before our acquisition of Scottrade). The SAR award agreement provided that, for each of calendar years 2016 and 2017, Mr. deSilva would become eligible to receive a cash bonus determined based on Scottrade's consolidated pre-tax earnings. Cash bonus amounts are paid in three, equal, annual installments, with the first installment paid on the last day of the applicable year of performance, in each case subject to Mr. deSilva's continued employment through the end of the applicable year. In the event of a termination of Mr. deSilva's employment as a result of his death or disability, or termination by Scottrade or any of its affiliates (including the Company) without cause, any cash bonuses that have not yet vested under the SAR award based on Mr. deSilva's continued employment, will accelerate vesting in full and become payable to him. In connection with the Company's acquisition of Scottrade, Mr. deSilva became eligible to receive, and was paid, an amount equal to $4,087,423. Other than these cash bonuses, following the closing of the Company's acquisition of Scottrade, no new amounts of cash bonuses will become eligible to be earned or paid under Mr. deSilva's SAR award.

Summary Table – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table summarizes potential payments upon termination or change in control for the named executive officers who were still serving as executive officers as of September 30, 2018. Each of the named executive officers will be entitled to receive change in control benefits only if his employment is terminated in connection with or following a change in control. "Cause" and "good reason," where applicable, are defined above in the summary of employment agreements for Messrs. Hockey, Boyle and deSilva and any applicable award agreements. Except as specifically indicated in the footnotes to the table below, we used the following assumptions in calculating the amounts included the table and discussion below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As required by SEC rules, we assume the triggering event causing the payment occurred on September 28, 2018, the last  business day of our last completed fiscal year, and the price per share of the common stock of the Company was $52.83, the closing market price on that date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We treat all amounts of base salary and annual cash incentive that were earned and accrued, including unused vacation, as of  the date of the triggering event as paid immediately prior to the triggering event.  
[END TABLE]
These payments and benefits are payable by the Company (or its successor as applicable, in the case of any payments and benefits occurring after a change in control).

Executive Compensation and Related Information 
CEO Pay Ratio 
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The annual total compensation of our median employee, excluding our CEO, for our fiscal year  2018 was $87,721.   
 The annual total compensation of our median employee, excluding our CEO, for our fiscal year  2018 was $87,721.   
 The annual total compensation of our CEO for our fiscal year 2018 was $8,577,509.   
 The annual total compensation of our CEO for our fiscal year 2018 was $8,577,509.   
 The ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee for our  fiscal year 2018 was estimated to be 98 to 1.   
 The ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee for our  fiscal year 2018 was estimated to be 98 to 1.   
[END TABLE]
The median employee generally is the employee whose annual total compensation is at the midpoint of our employees, ranked in order of their compensation amounts. We used W-2 compensation as the compensation measure for determining our median employee, as permitted by the SEC rules. We reviewed the W-2 compensation information for the approximately 9,291 individuals who, for purposes of this disclosure, as of September 30, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year 2018, were employed by us and were located in the U.S., excluding our CEO. 
We excluded all of our approximately 17 employees who are located outside of the U.S., including approximately six employees in Hong Kong and 11 employees in Singapore. Our non-U.S. employees constituted less than 5% of our estimated total of 9,308 employees as of September 30, 2018. 
Based on W-2 compensation information, we identified a small subset of employees whose compensation was closest to or constituted the median W-2 compensation amount. We then calculated the fiscal year 2018 annual total compensation of each employee in the subset in a manner consistent with the SEC rules for determining the compensation of our named executive officers disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table. The employee whose annual total compensation was at the median of the subset was selected as the median employee whose annual total compensation was compared to the annual total compensation of our CEO for purposes of the ratio set forth above. We did not make any cost of living adjustments. 
Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
As of the Record Date, there were 561,142,554 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The following table sets forth, as of the Record Date, the beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock by each of the named executive officers, by current directors and nominees, by each person believed by the Company to beneficially own more than 5% of the Company's common stock and by all current executive officers and directors of the Company as a group. Shares of common stock subject to options that are exercisable within 60 days of the Record Date are deemed beneficially owned by the person holding such options and are treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of such person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of ownership of any other person. RSUs held by our directors and officers and PRSUs held by our officers are included below, but do not have voting rights until the units vest and the underlying shares are distributed. Deferred stock units held by our directors and officers are included below, but do not have voting rights until the underlying shares are distributed to the holder pursuant to his or her deferral election.

Stock Ownership and Related Information 
Stockholders Agreement 
Concurrently with entering into the share purchase agreement related to the Company's acquisition of TD Waterhouse, the Company, certain Ricketts stockholders and TD entered into the Stockholders Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement contains certain governance arrangements and provisions relating to board of directors composition, stock ownership, transfers by TD, voting and various other matters. On December 4, 2013, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Stockholders Agreement, which extended the term of the Stockholders Agreement until January 24, 2021 and provided that, as of January 24, 2016, the Ricketts stockholders would cease to be parties to the Stockholders Agreement and subject to any of its terms (the "Ricketts Cessation"). 
Governance of TD Ameritrade. The Stockholders Agreement provides that the board of directors of the Company consists of twelve members, five of whom may be designated by TD, one of whom is the CEO of the Company and the remainder of whom are outside independent directors. The outside independent directors are nominated by the OID Committee, subject to TD's right to reject such nominees on a reasonable basis. The number of directors designated by TD depends on it maintaining specified ownership thresholds of common stock and may increase or decrease from time to time based on those ownership thresholds, but will never exceed five. 
In 2013, the Ricketts stockholders' ownership decreased, resulting in a decrease in the number of directors that they were entitled to designate from two to one. The vacancy created by this decrease was filled by Mr. Bettino, an outside independent director, in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. In May 2014, Mr. Moglia met the requirements for independence and was designated as an outside independent director. 
On December 22, 2015, Mr. Todd M. Ricketts was elected as a member of the board of directors as an outside independent director, effective February 18, 2016, obviating the requirement under the Stockholders Agreement that Mr. Ricketts resign from the board of directors immediately prior to the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders in connection with the Ricketts Cessation. 
The Stockholders Agreement provides, subject to applicable laws and certain conditions and exceptions, that the Company shall cause each committee of its board of directors to consist of two of the directors designated by TD, and three outside independent directors. These levels of committee representation are subject to adjustment from time to time based on TD's maintenance of specified ownership thresholds. TD has agreed to vote its shares of common stock in favor of, and the Company agreed that it would solicit votes in favor of, each director nominated for election in the manner provided for in the Stockholders Agreement. 
Share Ownership. TD is permitted to exercise voting rights only with respect to up to 45% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company for the remaining term of the Stockholders Agreement. Under the Stockholders Agreement (beginning January 24, 2016) if the Company's stock repurchases cause TD's ownership percentage to exceed 45%, TD shall use reasonable efforts to sell or dispose of such excess stock, subject to TD's commercial judgment as to the optimal timing, amount and method of sales with a view to maximizing proceeds from such sales. TD has no absolute obligation to reduce its ownership percentage to 45% by the termination of the Stockholders Agreement. However, prior to and following the termination of the Stockholders Agreement, TD will either not vote any such excess stock or, at the discretion of the Company, vote any such excess stock on any matter in the same proportions as all the outstanding shares of stock held by holders other than TD and its affiliates are voted. In no event may the Company repurchase shares of its common stock that would result in TD's ownership percentage exceeding 47%. 
The Stockholders Agreement also provides that TD will not, subject to certain exceptions, solicit proxies with respect to common stock. Notwithstanding the limitations on TD's ownership described above, the Stockholders Agreement permits TD to make a non-public proposal to the board of directors to acquire additional shares pursuant to a tender offer or merger for 100% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company and to complete such a transaction, subject to the approval of independent directors and holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock not affiliated with TD. 
Right to Purchase Securities. TD has the right to purchase up to its respective proportionate share of future issuances of common stock, other than in connection with the Company stock issued as consideration in an acquisition by the Company. If the Company proposes to issue shares as consideration in an acquisition, the Company will discuss in good faith with TD alternative structures in which a portion of such shares would be sold to TD, with the proceeds of such sale used to fund the acquisition. 
The Stockholders Agreement further provides that if the Company engages in discussions with a third party that could result in the acquisition by such party of 25% of the voting securities or consolidated assets of the Company, the Company must offer TD the opportunity to participate in parallel discussions with the Company regarding a comparable transaction. 
Transfer Restrictions. The Stockholders Agreement generally prohibits TD from transferring shares of common stock, absent approval of the OID Committee, to any holder of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company, subject to certain exceptions. 
Stock Ownership and Related Information 
 As long as TD and the Company constitute the same audit client, TD may not engage the auditor of the Company, and the Company will not engage the auditors of TD, to provide certain non-audit services. 
Information Rights. Subject to confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations and as long as it owns at least 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock, TD is entitled to access information regarding the Company's business, operations and plans as it may reasonably require to appropriately manage and evaluate its investment in the Company and to comply with its obligations under U.S. and Canadian laws. 
Obligation to Repurchase Shares. If the Company issues shares of its common stock pursuant to any compensation or similar program or arrangement, then the Company will, subject to certain exceptions, use its reasonable efforts to repurchase a corresponding number of shares of its common stock in the open market within 120 days after any such issuance. 
Non-Competition Covenants. Subject to specified exceptions, the Stockholders Agreement generally provides that TD and its affiliates may not participate in or own any portion of a business engaged in the business of providing securities brokerage services in the U.S. to retail traders, individual investors and registered investment advisors. If TD acquires indirectly a competing business as a result of its acquisition of a non-competing business, TD must offer to sell the competing business to the Company at its appraised fair value determined in accordance with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. If the Company decides not to purchase the competing business, TD must use commercially reasonable efforts to divest the competing business within two years. TD and its affiliates are permitted under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement to own a passive investment representing less than 2% of a class of equity securities of a competing business so long as the class of equity securities is traded on a national securities exchange in the U.S. or the Toronto Stock Exchange. TD also is permitted to engage in certain activities in the ordinary course of its banking and securities businesses. In addition, the Company has agreed that it will not hold or acquire control of a bank or similar depository institution except (1) as a result of a business combination transaction approved by the Company's board of directors and involving an entity not more than 75% of whose consolidated revenues were generated by one or more insured depository institutions and as to which (a) TD has elected to acquire such entity's insured depository institutions at a price mutually agreed between the Company and TD, (b) the Company divests or causes the seller to divest completely such insured depository institution before closing, or (c) TD otherwise consents to the business combination transaction with such entity, or (2) in the event that TD does not hold control of any bank or similar depository institution that is able to offer money market deposit accounts to clients of the Company as a designated sweep vehicle or TD has indicated that it is not willing to offer such accounts to clients of the Company through a bank or similar depository institution it controls. 
Termination of the Stockholders Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement will terminate in its entirety, upon the earliest to occur of (a) the consummation of a merger or tender offer where TD acquires 100% of the common stock, (b) January 24, 2021, (c) the date on which TD's ownership of common stock falls below approximately 4% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, (d) the commencement by a third party of a tender offer or exchange offer for not less than 25% of the Company's common stock, unless the board of directors recommends against the offer and continues to take steps to oppose the offer, (e) the approval by the board of directors of a business combination that would result in another party owning more than 25% of the voting securities or consolidated assets of the Company or which would otherwise result in a change of control of the Company, or (f) the acquisition of more than 20% of the voting securities of the Company by a third party. For a period of up to one year following a termination under clause (d), (e) or (f) above, TD will be prohibited from acquiring shares of the Company's common stock that would cause its aggregate ownership to exceed 45% except pursuant to a tender offer or merger for 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock approved by the holders of a majority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock (other than TD). In addition, during that one-year period, the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement relating to the designation of directors and certain other provisions will remain in effect.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions. The board of directors has adopted a written Related Party Transactions Policy covering the review and approval or ratification of any transaction, arrangement or relationship involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, with a value of $120,000 or more per fiscal year, and in which any related party had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest required to be disclosed under applicable SEC rules. Related parties are our directors, executive officers and any stockholder beneficially owning more than 5% of our common stock or any of their immediate family members. Under the policy, the OID Committee reviews related party transactions and may approve or ratify them only if it is determined that they are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. When reviewing a related party transaction, the OID Committee will consider, among other factors determined to be appropriate, the following factors (to the extent relevant to the related party transaction): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the related party transaction are fair to the Company and are no less favorable than terms that would  apply if the transaction did not involve a related party;  
[END TABLE]

Stock Ownership and Related Information 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Company is party to an insured deposit account ("IDA") agreement, under which TD Bank USA and TD Bank, N.A.  (together, the "TD Depository Institutions") make available to clients of the Company FDIC-insured (up to specified limits) money market deposit accounts as either designated sweep vehicles or as  non-sweep deposit accounts. The Company provides marketing, recordkeeping and support services for the TD Depository Institutions with respect to the money market deposit accounts. In exchange for providing  these services, the TD Depository Institutions pay the Company an aggregate marketing fee based on the weighted average yield earned on the client IDA assets, less the actual interest paid to clients, a servicing fee to the TD Depository  Institutions and the cost of FDIC insurance premiums.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The current IDA agreement became effective as of January 1, 2013 and had an initial term expiring July 1, 2018.  It is automatically renewable for successive five-year terms, provided that it may be terminated by either the Company or the TD Depository Institutions by providing written notice of non-renewal at least  two years prior to the initial expiration date or the expiration date of any subsequent renewal period. Notice of non-renewal was not provided by either party, therefore the IDA agreement automatically renewed  for an additional five- year term on July 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The fee earned on the IDA agreement is calculated based on two primary components: (a) the yield on fixed-rate  "notional" investments, based on prevailing fixed rates for identical balances and maturities in the interest rate swap market (generally LIBOR-based) at the time such investments were added to the IDA portfolio (including any adjustments  required to adjust the variable rate leg of such swaps to a one-month reset frequency and the overall swap payment frequency to monthly) and (b) the yield on floating-rate investments. As of  September 30, 2018, the IDA portfolio was comprised of approximately 78% fixed-rate notional investments and 22% floating rate investments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The IDA agreement provides that the Company may designate amounts and maturity dates for the fixed-rate notional  investments in the IDA portfolio, subject to certain limitations. For example, if the Company designates that $100 million of deposits be invested in 5-year fixed-rate investments, and on the day such  investment is confirmed by the TD Depository Institutions the prevailing fixed yield for the applicable 5-year U.S. dollar LIBOR-based swaps is 1.45%, then the Company will earn a gross fixed yield of  1.45% on that portion of the portfolio (before any deductions for interest paid to clients, the servicing fee to the TD Depository Institutions and the cost of FDIC insurance premiums). In the event that (1) the federal funds effective  rate is established at 0.75% or greater and (2) the rate on 5-year U.S. dollar interest rate swaps is equal to or greater than 1.50% for 20 consecutive business days, then the rate earned by the Company  on new fixed-rate notional investments will be reduced by 20% of the excess of the 5-year U.S. dollar swap rate over 1.50%, up to a maximum of 0.10%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The yield on floating-rate investments is calculated daily based on the greater of the following rates published by the  Federal Reserve: (1) the interest rate paid by Federal Reserve Banks on balances held in excess of required reserve balances and contractual clearing balances under Regulation D and (2) the daily effective federal funds rate.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The interest rates paid to clients are set by the TD Depository Institutions and are not linked to any index. The  servicing fee to the TD Depository Institutions under the IDA agreement is equal to 25 basis points on the aggregate average daily balance in the IDA accounts, subject to adjustment as it relates to deposits of less than or equal to  $20 billion kept in floating-rate investments or in fixed-rate notional investments with a maturity of up to 24 months ("short-term fixed-rate investments"). For such floating-rate and short-term fixed-rate investments, the servicing  fee is equal to the difference of the interest rate earned on the investments less the FDIC premiums paid (in basis points), divided by two. The servicing fee has a floor of 3 basis points (subject to adjustment from time to time to reflect material  changes to the TD Depository Institutions' leverage costs) and a maximum of 25 basis points.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      In the event the marketing fee computation results in a negative amount, the Company must pay the TD Depository  Institutions the negative amount. This effectively results in the Company guaranteeing the TD Depository Institutions revenue equal to the servicing fee on the IDA agreement, plus the reimbursement of FDIC insurance premiums. The marketing fee  computation under the IDA agreement is affected by many variables, including the type, duration, principal balance and yield of the fixed-rate and floating-rate investments, the prevailing interest rate environment, the amount of client deposits and  the yield paid on client deposits. Because a negative marketing fee computation would arise only if there were extraordinary movements in many of these variables, the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make  under this arrangement cannot be reasonably estimated. Management believes the potential for the marketing fee calculation to result in a negative amount is remote. In the event the Company withdraws a notional investment prior to its maturity, the  Company is required to reimburse the TD Depository Institutions an amount equal to the economic replacement value of the investment, as defined in the IDA agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Under Amendment No. 1 to the IDA agreement ("IDA Amendment"), which became effective on the closing of the  Merger Agreement on September 18, 2017 with respect to Scottrade brokerage accounts, the parties will cause: (1) the funds of Scottrade clients held in other money market sweep accounts prior to closing to be withdrawn and deposited with  TD's money market deposit accounts within a specified number of days following closing or following the maturity date of the deposits (depending on the type of deposit), (2) new funds deposited by Scottrade clients after closing to be  deposited with TD's money market deposit accounts, (3) the existing funds of Scottrade clients in excess of the FDIC deposit insurance limits to be deposited into master accounts with TD, and (4) if the Company elects to sweep any  uninsured deposits to a bank other than TD, the Company will sweep a certain amount of uninsured deposit accounts from its other client accounts to TD for a period of time that term funds remain at Scottrade's program banks. For the complete  IDA Amendment agreement, see Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 7, 2018.

         Proposal No. 2 — Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
         Proposal No. 2 — Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
The guiding principles of the Company's compensation policies and decisions include aligning each executive's compensation with the Company's business strategy and the interests of our stockholders and providing incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who are important to our long-term success. Consistent with this philosophy, a significant portion of the total compensation for each of our executive officers is directly related to the Company's earnings and to other performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans, as well as performance against our peers. 
As required by Section 14A of the 1934 Act, we are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This advisory vote to approve executive compensation proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the principles, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. We currently hold our say-on-pay vote every year. Stockholders will have an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least every six years. The next advisory vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote will occur at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Stockholders are urged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, which discusses how our compensation design and practices reflect our compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee and the board of directors believe that our compensation design and practices are effective in implementing our guiding principles. At the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved the say-on-pay proposal with more than 99% of the total votes cast voting in favor. 
As this is an advisory vote, the result will not be binding on the Company, the board of directors or the Compensation Committee, although our Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when evaluating our compensation principles, design and practices. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your abstention will have no effect on the vote. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker how to vote on this "non-routine" proposal, your broker does not have authority to vote your shares. Where no instructions are indicated, properly executed and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

         Proposal No. 3 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
         Proposal No. 3 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") has been appointed by the Audit Committee as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. This appointment is being presented to the stockholders for ratification. The ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the matter, provided that a quorum of at least a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at the meeting. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your abstention will have no effect on the vote. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker on how to vote on this "routine" proposal, your broker will nevertheless have authority to vote your shares on this "routine" proposal in your broker's discretion. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not have any other effect on the outcome of the proposal. Where no instructions are indicated, properly executed and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the ratification of EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be provided an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate inquiries from stockholders.

The Audit Committee considers whether the provision of audit-related, tax and other non-audit services are compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence, and has determined such services for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were compatible. 
We have been advised by EY that neither the firm, nor any member of the firm, has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in the Company or its subsidiaries. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
On an ongoing basis, management communicates specific projects and categories of service for which the advance approval of the Audit Committee is requested. 
The Audit Committee reviews these requests and advises management if the committee approves the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm. No services are undertaken which are not pre-approved. On a periodic basis, management reports to the Audit Committee regarding the actual spending for such projects and services compared to the approved amounts. All of the services provided by our independent auditor in 2018 and 2017, including services related to audit, audit-related fees, tax fees and all other fees described above, were approved by the Audit Committee under its pre-approval policies.

The Board of Directors 
TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation 
Fellow Directors: 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its general oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee conducted its oversight activities for TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation and subsidiaries ("TD Ameritrade") in accordance with the duties and responsibilities outlined in the audit committee charter. The Audit Committee annually reviews the NASDAQ standard of independence for audit committees and its most recent review determined that the committee meets that standard. 
TD Ameritrade management is responsible for the preparation, consistency, integrity and fair presentation of the financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, systems of internal control, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. The Company's independent Registered Public Accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The Audit Committee, with the assistance and support of the Corporate Audit Department and management of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, has fulfilled its objectives, duties and responsibilities as stipulated in the Audit Committee charter and has provided adequate and appropriate independent oversight and monitoring of TD Ameritrade's systems of internal control for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
These activities included, but were not limited to, the following significant accomplishments during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the external auditors.    
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Received written disclosures and letter from the external auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board, and discussed with the auditors their independence.    
[END TABLE]
In reliance on the Committee's review and discussions of the matters referred to above, the Audit Committee recommends the audited financial statements be included in TD Ameritrade's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1)  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) is a  non-GAAP financial measure as defined by SEC Regulation G. Non-GAAP EPS excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of acquired  intangible assets, because management does not believe it is indicative of our underlying business performance, and acquisition-related expenses, because management believes these costs are not representative of the costs of running the  Company's on-going business. Non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for diluted EPS.
