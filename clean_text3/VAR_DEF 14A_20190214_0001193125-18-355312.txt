[BEGIN TABLE]
• to elect nine directors to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the  accompanying Proxy Statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for  fiscal year 2019; and

The Board of Directors has selected December 17, 2018 as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. A list of stockholders as of that date will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at our principal executive offices at 3100 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, California 94304 for 10 days before the Annual Meeting. 
Except for those stockholders that have already requested printed copies of our proxy materials, we are furnishing our proxy materials for this Annual Meeting to you through the Internet. On or about December 21, 2018, we mailed to stockholders as of the record date a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"). Certain stockholders who previously requested email notice in lieu of mail received the Notice by email. If you received a Notice by mail or email, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you specifically request one. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review all of the important information contained in our Proxy Statement and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 (which we posted on the Internet on December 21, 2018), as well as how to submit your proxy over the Internet. We believe that mailing or emailing the Notice and posting other materials on the Internet allows us to provide you with the information you need more quickly while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is soliciting my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("we,"  "us," "Varian" or the "Company") is sending you this Proxy Statement in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the  "Annual Meeting") or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Certain of our directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies on the Board's behalf by mail, telephone, email or fax or in person. We have hired  Georgeson LLC, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10104, to assist in soliciting proxies from brokers, bank nominees and other stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is paying for this solicitation?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will pay for the solicitation of proxies. Our directors, officers and employees will not receive additional  remuneration. We expect that we will pay Georgeson LLC. not more than $9,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and also will reimburse banks, brokers, custodians,  nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable charges and expenses to forward our proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What am I voting on?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You will be voting on three proposals. Proposal One is for the election of Anat Ashkenazi, Jeffrey R. Balser,  Judy Bruner, Jean-Luc Butel, Regina E. Dugan, R. Andrew Eckert, Timothy E. Guertin, David J. Illingworth and Dow R. Wilson to the Board for a one-year term ending at the  2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal Two is an advisory vote on the compensation of the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table (the "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs") as described in this Proxy Statement. 
Proposal Three is the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who can vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Only our stockholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2018 may vote. Each share of  common stock outstanding on that date is entitled to one vote on all matters to come before the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the  Internet availability of proxy materials this year insteadof a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have  elected to provide access to our proxy materials (consisting of the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018, as filed  with the SEC on November 26, 2018) over the Internet. Therefore, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders. Starting on the date of distribution of the Notice, all  stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request printed  copies may be found in the Notice. If you request printed versions of the proxy materials by mail, the materials will also include a proxy card or other voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I receive proxy materials for future annual meetings by email rather than receiving a paper copy of the  Notice?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a holder of record, you may elect to receive the Notice or other future proxy materials by email by  logging into www.proxyvote.com and entering your email address before you vote if you are voting by  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a "street name" holder?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If your shares are registered directly in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our stock transfer  agent, you are considered the stockholder of record for those shares.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of the shares and your shares are said to be held in "street name." Street name holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the broker, bank or other nominee how to vote their shares using the method described under "How do I vote and how do I revoke my proxy?" below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote and how do I revoke my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you hold your shares in your own name as a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares either in person  at the meeting or by proxy. To vote in person, please bring a form of identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, and proof that you were a stockholder as of December 17, 2018, and we will give you a ballot when you  arrive. To vote by proxy, please vote in one of the following ways:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet. You may vote through the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the  instructions provided in the Notice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via Telephone. If you received your proxy materials or request printed copies by mail and are in the  United States, you may vote by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via Mail. If you received your proxy materials or request printed copies by mail, you may vote by mail by  marking, dating, signing and mailing the proxy card in the envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
Voting by proxy will not affect your right to vote your shares if you attend the Annual Meeting and want to vote in person—by voting in person you automatically revoke your proxy. You also may revoke your proxy at any time before the applicable voting deadline by giving our Secretary written notice of your revocation, by submitting a later-dated proxy card or by voting again using the telephone or Internet (your latest telephone or Internet proxy is the one that will be counted). 
If you vote by proxy, the individuals named as proxyholders will vote your shares as you instruct. If you vote your shares over the telephone, you must select a voting option ("For" or "Withhold" for directors; "For," "Against" or "Abstain" for Proposals Two and Three) in order for your proxy to be counted on that matter. If you validly vote your shares over the Internet or by mail but do not provide any voting instructions, the individuals named as proxyholders will vote your shares FOR all directors, and FOR Proposals Two and Three. In that case, the proxyholders will have full discretion and authority to vote in the election of directors and to allocate votes among any or all of the nominees for director in any order they determine. 
If your shares are registered in street name, you must vote your shares in the manner prescribed by your broker, bank or other nominee. In most instances, you can do this over the telephone or Internet, or if you have received or request a hard copy of the proxy statement and accompanying voting instruction form, you may mark, sign, date and mail your voting instruction form in the envelope your broker, bank or other nominee provides. The materials that were sent to you have specific instructions for how to submit your   vote and the deadline for doing so. If you would like to revoke your proxy, you must follow the broker, bank or other nominee's instructions on how to do so. If you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the deadline for submitting a proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day. In order  to be counted, proxies submitted by telephone or the Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 13, 2019. Proxies submitted by mail must be received prior to the start of the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  On the record date, we had 91,165,275 shares of common stock, $1.00 par value, outstanding. Voting can take  place at the Annual Meeting only if stockholders owning a majority of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are present in person or represented by proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are abstentions and broker non-votes and how do they affect  voting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Abstentions—If you specify that you wish to "abstain" from voting on an item, your shares  will not be voted on that particular item. Abstentions are counted toward establishing a quorum. Abstentions have no effect on the election of directors and are included in the shares entitled to vote on Proposals Two and Three. On Proposals Two and  Three, abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Broker Non-Votes—Under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, if your broker holds your shares in its name and does not receive voting instructions from you, your broker has discretion to vote these shares on certain "routine" matters, including the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. However, on non-routine matters such as the election of directors and Proposal Two, your broker must receive voting instructions from you, as your broker does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item. So long as the broker has discretion to vote on at least one proposal, these "broker non-votes" are counted toward establishing a quorum. When voted on "routine" matters, broker non-votes are counted toward determining the outcome of that "routine" matter. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is needed?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For Proposal One, the election of directors, the nine nominees may be elected only upon the affirmative vote of  a majority of the total votes cast. In other words, the number of votes cast "For" a nominee's election must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that nominee's election, not including any abstentions. Votes  "Against" a nominee's election will count as a vote cast. However, abstentions or shares as to which a shareholder gives no authority or discretion, including "broker non-votes," will  have no effect and not count as a vote cast with respect to that nominee.  
[END TABLE]
For Proposal Two, an affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement. 
For Proposal Three, an affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on Proposal Three is required to approve the ratification of the appointment of Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Because your vote on Proposal Two is advisory, it will not bind the Board or the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee"). However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take the results into consideration in making future determinations on executive compensation of our Named Executive Officers.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if a director does not receive a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Prior to an election, each incumbent director submits a resignation letter whose effectiveness is contingent  upon the incumbent director failing to receive more than 50% of the votes cast in an uncontested election. If an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will  make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its  decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.  
[END TABLE]
If a director's offer of resignation is not accepted by the Board, the director will continue to serve until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's offer of resignation is accepted by the Board, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board pursuant to the provisions of our By-Laws. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I vote on other matters?  
[END TABLE]

A:  You are entitled to vote on any other matters that are properly brought before the Annual Meeting. Our By-Laws limit the business conducted at any annual meeting to (1) business in the notice of the annual meeting, (2) business directed by the Board and (3) business brought by a stockholder of record  entitled to vote at the meeting so long as the stockholder has met the requirements for submitting stockholder proposals provided in our By-Laws. Under our By-Laws, a  stockholder must notify our Secretary in writing (at our Palo Alto, California headquarters) of the proposal not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting, which for the 2020 Annual  Meeting of Stockholders will be no earlier than October 17, 2019 and no later than November 16, 2019. The notice must give a brief description of the business to be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting the business  and the text of the proposal, as well as the name and address of the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made, the number of shares owned and information about that beneficial ownership, all as  detailed in our By-Laws. The notice must also describe any material interest the stockholder or beneficial owner has in the business and arrangements between such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other  person in connection with the proposal and must include certain representations, all as detailed in our By-Laws.

To have your stockholder proposal be considered for presentation in the proxy statement and proxy card for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, rather than just voted upon at the meeting without inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy card, a stockholder must submit to our Secretary (at our Palo Alto, California headquarters) a written proposal no later than August 23, 2019. The submission must contain the information required under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). 
We do not expect any matters other than those listed in this Proxy Statement to come before the Annual Meeting. If any other matter is presented, your proxy gives the individuals named as proxyholders the authority to vote your shares to the extent authorized by Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, which includes matters that the proxyholders did not know were to be presented at least 90 days before the anniversary of the mailing of last year's proxy statement.

A:  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") will consider  potential candidates for directors submitted by stockholders, in addition to those suggested by other Board members and members of our management, and does not evaluate potential candidates differently based upon the source of the potential  candidate. The Nominating Committee considers and evaluates each properly submitted potential candidate for director in an effort to achieve a balance of skills and characteristics on the Board, as well as to ensure that the composition of the Board  at all times adheres to the independence requirements applicable to NYSE-listed companies and other regulatory requirements applicable to us. Please refer to "Proposal One—Election of Directors" and our Corporate Governance Guidelines  for additional details on our policy, process and membership criteria. A stockholder may recommend potential candidates for director by notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing (at our Palo Alto, California headquarters) as detailed in the  question and answer above.

Our Board; Selection of Nominees 
At this Annual Meeting, you and the other stockholders will elect nine individuals to serve as directors. Our entire Board is subject to election at each annual meeting of stockholders, and each director will serve until his or her successor has been elected, unless such director dies, resigns, retires or is disqualified or removed. 
Our Nominating Committee is charged with identifying, evaluating and recommending to the full Board director nominees. There are no minimum qualifications for directors. The Nominating Committee generally seeks individuals who have or provide: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Knowledge about our industries and technologies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience in industries beyond healthcare;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• International business experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cultural, gender, ethnic or age diversity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience in financial oversight and with the financial community, and a strong reputation with the financial  community;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience in business management and the potential to succeed top management in the event of an unexpected  necessary Board intervention;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broad experience at policy making in business, government, education, technology or public interest; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business contacts, knowledge or influence useful to our business and product lines.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that all of our directors should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. Their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform and carry out all director duties in a responsible manner. Each director must also represent the interests of all stockholders. 
When seeking new director candidates, the Nominating Committee will consider potential candidates for directors submitted by Board members, members of our management and our stockholders. The Nominating Committee does not evaluate candidates differently based upon the source of the nominee. Anat Ashkenazi and Jeffrey R. Balser were recommended for appointment to the Board by a third-party search firm. 
All of the nominees, Anat Ashkenazi, Jeffrey R. Balser, Judy Bruner, Jean-Luc Butel, Regina E. Dugan, R. Andrew Eckert, Timothy E. Guertin, David J. Illingworth and Dow R. Wilson, are now members of the Board. 
In nominating Mr. Eckert, the Board and Nominating and Governance Committee also considered our guideline for director retirement that provides that a director should not serve on the Board for more than 15 years or after a director reaches the age of 75. This guideline may be waived as the Board deems appropriate. Mr. Eckert will have served for 15 years as of October 2019 and, accordingly, would not be eligible to serve out a full term based on the retirement guideline. The Board and Nominating Committee considered Mr. Eckert's expertise, his extensive experience with the Company, his position as Chairman of the Board, as well as the needs of the Company and the benefit that his continued service on the Board could provide and determined that notwithstanding the retirement guideline, it was in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to allow for his nomination for election at the Annual Meeting and continued service until the Annual Meeting in 2020.  Susan L. Bostrom is not standing for re-election and will retire from the Board immediately following the Annual Meeting. 
The individuals named as proxyholders will vote your proxy for the election of the nine nominees unless you direct them to withhold your vote. If any nominee becomes unable to serve as a director before the Annual Meeting (or decides not to serve), the individuals named as proxyholders may vote for a substitute. 
Set forth below are the names and ages of these nominees, the years they became directors, their principal occupations or employment for at least the past five years, the names of other public companies for which they serve as a director or have served as a director during the past five years. Also set forth are the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led our Nominating Committee to conclude that each person should serve as a director. All of our directors have held high-level positions in companies and have experience in dealing with complex issues. We believe that each is an individual of high character and integrity and has the ability to exercise sound judgment.

 Summary of Director Nominee Core Competencies and Composition Highlights 
The following chart summarizes the competencies that the Board considers valuable to effective oversight of the Company and illustrates how the current Board members individually and collectively represent these key competencies. The lack of an indicator for a particular competency does not mean that the director does not possess that qualification, skill or experience – we look to each director to be knowledgeable in these areas. Rather, the indicator represents a core competency that the director brings to the Board.

Beginning with our 2018 Annual Meeting, if the number of nominees timely nominated for an annual meeting does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each nominee  shall be elected if the nominee receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast, not including any abstentions. Prior to an election, each incumbent director submits a resignation letter whose effectiveness is contingent upon the  incumbent director failing to receive more than 50% of the votes cast in an uncontested election. If an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will make a  recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and  the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.

This proxy access provision may be used by an eligible stockholder, or a  group of up to 20 eligible stockholders, who has continuously owned at least three percent or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock for three years before, and including the day of, submitting a nomination notice, and who continues to  hold the qualifying minimum number of shares through the date of the applicable annual meeting of stockholders. The proxy access provision provides that an eligible stockholder, or a group of eligible stockholders, may nominate up to the greater of  (i) 20% of the total number of directors who are members of the Board as of the last day on which a nomination notice may be submitted, or (ii) two directors.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board has eliminated certain perquisites for executives, including the Executive Car Program and tax gross-ups.  
[END TABLE]
Director Independence 
The Board has determined that all of our directors, except Mr. Wilson, are "independent" for purposes of the NYSE listing requirements and under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Wilson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is an employee and therefore not "independent." The Board considered transactions and relationships, both direct and indirect, between each director (and his or her immediate family) and the Company and its subsidiaries and affirmatively determined that none of, Ms. Ashkenazi, Dr. Balser, Ms. Bruner, Mr. Butel, Ms. Dugan, Mr. Eckert, Mr. Guertin and Mr. Illingworth and has any material relationship, either direct or indirect, with us other than as a director and stockholder. 
Additionally, in making its determination the Board analyzed the following relationships and determined that these relationships are not inconsistent with a determination that these directors are "independent" for purposes of the NYSE listing requirements and under our Corporate Governance Guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dr. Balser is the Chief Executive Officer of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which is a customer of  ours.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Eckert serves as an outside director of a company from whom we are licensing and with whom we are  developing certain technology.  
[END TABLE]
Board Meetings 
The Board met nine times in fiscal year 2018. Four of these Board meetings included executive sessions of either the independent directors or the non-management directors, or both, with Mr. Eckert presiding at such meetings. We have five standing committees of the Board: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Executive Committee. Each current director attended at least 75% of the total Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which they served that were held in fiscal year 2018. Directors are encouraged to attend meetings of committees on which they do not serve as members. However, each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Ethics Committee and the Nominating Committee regularly hold executive sessions of only the committee members or non-management directors. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines designed to promote the functioning of the Board and its committees. These Guidelines address Board composition, Board functions and responsibilities, qualifications, leadership structure, committees and meetings.  Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not indicate a particular Board structure, and the Board is given the flexibility to select its Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer in the manner that it believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer may be filled by one individual or two. The Board has determined that having Mr. Eckert, who is "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards, serve as Chairman and Mr. Wilson serve as Chief Executive Officer is in the best interests of the stockholders. We have separated the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman in recognition of the differences between the two roles as they are presently defined. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting our strategic direction and for our day-to-day leadership and performance, while the Chairman provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and leads the Board. The Board believes its administration of its risk oversight function has not affected the Board's leadership structure. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To align the Board's interests with the interests of our stockholders, the Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for its members. The guidelines state that each director should own shares of common stock (which for this purpose includes shares subject to stock unit awards) with a value at least equal to five times his or her applicable annual retainer fee. Directors who were first appointed or elected to the Board after February 2004 must achieve the guideline within five years after such appointment or election. At the end of fiscal year 2018, all directors met the guidelines or were within the allowed time frame for meeting the guidelines. Under our insider trading policy, purchases on margin and the buying and selling of puts and calls of Company securities are prohibited. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Company faces a number of risks, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory and competitive risks. Our management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face. While our Board, as a whole, has ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management, it administers its risk oversight role in part through the Board committee structure, with the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Ethics Committee and Nominating Committee responsible for monitoring and reporting on the material risks associated with their respective subject matter areas. 
The Board's role in our risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management, as well as external advisors such as Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance") and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), on areas of material risk to us, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory and competitive risks. The full Board (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are reviewed by a particular committee) receives these reports from those responsible for the relevant risk in order to enable the Board to understand our risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. When a committee receives the report, the Chairman of the relevant committee generally provides a summary to the full Board at the next Board meeting. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role. The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of principal risk exposures related to financial statements, legal, regulatory and other matters, as well as related mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee is also tasked with reviewing cybersecurity risks and incidents and any other risks and incidents relevant to our computerized information system controls and security, and discussing if any such risks and incidents should be disclosed in our periodic filings with the SEC. The Compensation Committee assesses, at least annually, the risks associated with our compensation policies. The Ethics Committee assists the Board in oversight and monitoring of principal risks related to ethical compliance matters, such as compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, as well as related mitigation efforts. The Nominating Committee assists the Board in oversight of risks that we have relative to compliance with corporate governance standards.  Board Committees and Committee Meetings 
Each of our standing committees has a written charter approved by the Board that clearly establishes the committee's roles and responsibilities. Copies of the charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Executive Committee and the Nominating Committee, as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct, can be found through the "Corporate Governance" link on the Investors page on our website at www.varian.com.

Compensation and Management Development Committee 
Chair: Ms. Bostrom 
Additional Members: Dr. Balser, Mr. Butel and Mr. Eckert 
Meetings in Fiscal Year 2018: 7 
Functions 
The Compensation Committee performs the following principal functions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discharges the Board's responsibilities relating to compensation of our executive officers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluates our compensation plans, policies and programs for executive officers and recommends the establishment  of policies dealing with various compensation and employee benefit plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Administers our stock and cash incentive plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assesses, at least annually, the risks associated with our compensation policies, and reports to the Board and  the Audit Committee whether our compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determines all compensation for our executive group. Before making decisions on compensation for each of the executives other than the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"), the Compensation Committee reviews with our CEO each individual's performance and accomplishments over the prior year. Except for his own position, our CEO makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee about base salary increases, any changes to the incentive plan target awards and the amount of equity awards for each executive. However, the Compensation Committee retains and does not delegate any of its exclusive power to determine all matters of executive compensation and benefits. The Compensation Committee meets alone with its independent advisors to develop and establish a proposal for CEO pay. This proposal is also reviewed with the other independent members of the Board. 
Compensation Committee Advisors 
To independently assist and advise the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee has retained Pay Governance since May 2016. The engagement with Pay Governance is exclusively with the Compensation Committee, which has sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant or other advisor that it uses. Pay Governance has no relationship with the Company or management except as it may relate to performing services on behalf of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent them from independently representing the Compensation Committee. 
Typically, on an annual basis, the compensation consultant reviews and analyzes our executive compensation programs, compensation strategy and effectiveness of pay delivery. The compensation consultant provides market information on compensation trends and practices and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on competitive data. The compensation consultant advises the Compensation Committee chair on agenda items for Compensation Committee meetings, reviews management proposals and is available to perform special projects at the Compensation Committee chair's request. The compensation consultant also periodically provides the Compensation Committee with updates on regulatory and legislative developments pertaining to executive compensation and compensation committee governance. The compensation consultant provides analyses and recommendations that inform the Compensation Committee's decisions, but does not decide or approve any compensation actions. As needed, the Compensation Committee also consults with the compensation consultant on program design changes.  Member Qualifications 
In addition to being independent, each member of the Compensation Committee is a "non-employee director" for purposes of the Exchange Act and is an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

 PROPOSAL TWO 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION 
OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Background to the Advisory Vote 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was adopted by Congress as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, stockholders are able to cast an annual vote to approve on an advisory (non-binding) basis the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. It is expected that the next such advisory vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Philosophy of our Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee believes that attracting, motivating and retaining a team of high-performing executives with strong thought leadership, industry and subject matter expertise is critical to advancing the interests of stockholders. To promote these objectives, the Compensation Committee is guided by the following principles in developing our executive compensation program and in making pay decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attraction and Retention of Key Talent. The pay program should enable the Company to attract and retain  individuals with the background, experience, and talent required to lead the development and successful implementation of the Company's business strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-Driven Compensation. A high proportion of total compensation should be at risk and subject to  achievement of annual and long-term operating and strategic goals that deliver long-term value creation for both customers and stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholder Alignment. Long-term incentives should be awarded in Company stock to increase the alignment  of executive interests with those of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appropriately Balance Short- and Long-term Performance Orientation. The mix of incentives should place  emphasis on achievement of long-term sustainable growth and profitability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total Compensation Context. Pay decisions should be made in the context of total compensation relative to  the pay practices of competitors for key talent and in consideration of individual performance, experience, knowledge, and internal parity among peers.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee regularly assesses the program to ensure it is aligned with the Company's evolving business strategy and is effective in supporting its talent needs.  Varian's Fiscal Year 2018 Performance

PROPOSAL THREE 
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF 
PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 
Selection of the Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audit of our financial statements for fiscal year 2019, and we are asking you and other stockholders to ratify this appointment. Since 1962, PwC or its predecessors has been our independent accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews the independent registered public accounting firm's independence, including reviewing all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us and any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and the independent registered public accounting firm's performance. The Audit Committee also noted that our PwC engagement audit partner is subject to regular rotation and the most recent rotation occurred in fiscal year 2017. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, has determined to submit to stockholders for ratification the appointment of PwC. In the event that a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on Proposal Three does not ratify this appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will review its future appointment of PwC. 
We expect that a representative of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting and that representative will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally requested annually and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service, which must be classified in one of the four categories of services. The Audit Committee may also, on a case-by-case basis, pre-approve particular services that are not contained in the annual pre-approval request. In connection with this pre-approval policy, the Audit Committee also considers whether the categories of pre-approved services are consistent with the SEC rules  on accountant independence. 
Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
The following is a summary of the fees billed or to be billed to us by PwC for professional services rendered for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2018 and September 29, 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Fee Category    Fiscal Year 2018      Fiscal Year 2017   
 Audit Fees    $ 4,806,765      $ 4,416,302   
 Audit-Related Fees    $ 502,976        140,400   
 Tax Fees    $ 936,488        1,832,567   
 All Other Fees    $ 20,050        16,000   
 Total Fees    $ 6,266,279      $ 6,405,269   
[END TABLE]
 Audit Fees.    Consist of fees billed or to be billed for professional services rendered for the annual audit of our consolidated financial statements (as well as the related attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting) and review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports and services that PwC normally provides in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 
Audit-Related Fees.    Consist of fees billed or to be billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards and accounting consultations in connection with acquisitions and the separation and distribution of our Imaging Components business. 
Tax Fees.    Consist of fees billed or to be billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and international tax compliance, assistance with tax reporting requirements and audit compliance, tax planning, consulting and assistance on business restructuring and tax advice on mergers and acquisitions. Tax compliance fees were approximately $141,074 and $293,293 in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. All other tax fees were approximately $795,414 and $1,539,274 in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
All Other Fees.    Consist of fees for products and services other than the services reported above. All Other Fees for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to (1) attestations to ensure regulatory compliance and (2) annual subscription to accounting literature. 
The Audit Committee determined that PwC's provision of these services and the fees that we paid for these services, are compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee pre-approved all services that PwC provided in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 in accordance with the pre-approval policy discussed above.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") consists of the four directors whose names appear below. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the definition of "independent director" and otherwise qualifies to be a member of the Audit Committee under the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements. 
The Audit Committee's general role is to assist the Board in monitoring the Company's financial reporting process and related matters. Its specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter. The Audit Committee reviews its charter at least annually, and did so at the August 2018 Audit Committee meeting. 
As required by the charter, the Audit Committee reviewed the Company's audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 and met with management, as well as with representatives of PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss the audited financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with members of PwC the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. 
In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with members of PwC its independence from management and the Company. 
Based on these reviews and discussions and other matters it deemed relevant, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018. 
Furthermore, in connection with the standards for independence promulgated by the SEC, the Audit Committee reviewed the services provided by PwC, the fees the Company paid for these services, and whether the provision of the services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee deemed that the provision of the services is compatible with maintaining that independence. 
The Audit Committee has selected PwC to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. In doing so, the Audit Committee considered the results from its review of PwC's independence, including (a) all relationships between PwC and the Company and any disclosed relationships or services that may impact their objectivity and independence, (b) PwC's performance and qualification as an independent registered public accounting firm and (c) the fact that the PwC engagement audit partner is rotated on a regular basis as required by applicable laws and regulations. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Audit Committee has determined to submit its appointment of PwC to the stockholders for ratification. In the event that a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter does not ratify this appointment, the Audit Committee will review its future appointment of PwC.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Under U.S. securities laws, directors, certain officers and persons holding more than 10% of our common stock must report their initial ownership of our common stock and any changes in their ownership to the SEC. The SEC has designated specific due dates for these reports and we must identify in this Proxy Statement those persons who did not file these reports when due. Based solely on our review of copies of the reports filed with the SEC and the written representations of our directors and executive officers, we believe that each person who at any time during the 2018 fiscal year was a director or an executive officer or held more than 10% of our common stock filed the required reports on time in fiscal year 2018.  COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

Say on Pay Vote History and Stockholder Engagement 
Our Board and management are committed to maintaining sound and effective compensation and governance programs, with policies and programs reflecting leading practices and geared to building value for the Company's stockholders. We have ongoing discussions with our stockholders to understand their perspectives and to communicate on a variety of corporate governance topics, including executive compensation practices. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 89% of votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. Since the implementation of the Say-On-Pay stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers beginning at our 2011 Annual Meeting of stockholders, support from our stockholders for our executive compensation program and practices has averaged 92% of votes cast. 
In evaluating our compensation practices in 2018, the Compensation Committee was mindful of the high level of support our stockholders expressed for the Company's executive compensation philosophy and practices. The changes to our annual and long-term incentives that were introduced in fiscal year 2018 were designed to better align incentives with our evolving business strategy while still preserving our general approach to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee continued to apply the same principles and philosophy as in the prior fiscal year in determining executive compensation. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider stockholder concerns and feedback in the future.  Executive Compensation Practices Highlights 
A set of practices strengthen the alignment of our compensation program with our stockholders' interests:

Philosophy of Our Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee believes that attracting, motivating and retaining a team of high-performing executives with strong thought leadership, industry and subject matter expertise is critical to advancing the interests of stockholders. To promote these objectives, the Compensation Committee is guided by the following principles in developing our executive compensation program and in making pay decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attraction and Retention of Key Talent. The pay program should enable the company to attract and retain  individuals with the background, experience, and talent required to lead the development and successful implementation of the Company's business strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-Driven Compensation. A high proportion of total compensation should be at risk and subject to  achievement of annual and long-term operating and strategic goals that deliver long-term value creation for both customers and stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholder Alignment. Long-term incentives should be awarded in Company stock to increase the alignment  of executive interests with those of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appropriately Balance Short- and Long-term Performance Orientation. The mix of incentives should place  emphasis on achievement of long-term sustainable growth and profitability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total Compensation Context. Pay decisions should be made in the context of total compensation relative to  pay practices of competitors for key talent and in consideration of individual performance, experience, knowledge, and internal parity among peers.  
[END TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee regularly assesses the program to ensure it is aligned with the Company's evolving business strategy and is effective in supporting its talent needs.

 How We Make Compensation Decisions 
Role of the Compensation and Management Development Committee. The Committee oversees the development and administration of our executive compensation program, including the underlying philosophy, plans, and related policies. The Committee's responsibilities and process for determining the compensation of our senior executives includes the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Risk. Annually review the risks and rewards associated with the Company's compensation  programs. Ensure that the program includes plan design features that mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of the compensation and encourages and rewards prudent business judgment and appropriate risk-taking over the short term and  the long term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Program Assessment. Assess the program to ensure that it is well aligned with the Company's  evolving business strategy and is effective in supporting its talent needs. Solicit recommendations for changes from management and our compensation consultant as appropriate. Determine the specific plan designs to be used for the year.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CEO Compensation and Performance Goals. Annually review and approve corporate goals and objectives  relevant to the CEO's compensation; develop the process for evaluating the CEO's performance; lead the independent directors of the Board's evaluation of the CEO's performance in light of the foregoing corporate goals and  objectives; and recommend the CEO's compensation level based on this evaluation for approval by the independent directors of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation of Other Executives. Review, discuss, modify and approve, as appropriate, compensation  recommendations made by the CEO for other NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Considerations in Making Compensation Decisions. Consider, among other factors: the Company's overall  performance, stockholder return, the performance of the Company's business segments, the achievement of specific corporate goals and objectives that the Committee established, the achievement of any specific individual goals that have been  assigned, individual performance on job duties, compensation previously provided, compensation of other executives of the Company, and competitive compensation levels. In addition, the Committee confers with the independent directors of the Board  and considers, as appropriate, views expressed by stockholders on executive compensation matters, including results of stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Peer Group. Review and establish annually the Company's comparator/peer group for use in assessing  the competitive range of compensation provided to individuals in similar positions at comparable companies. See additional information on the fiscal year 2018 peer group in "Peer Group and Market Analysis" below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• General Advice to the Board. Review management and compensation matters having major implications to the  long-range development of the Company including plans for succession of the CEO and other executive officers and corporate officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Consultant. Engage an advisor and meet with its advisor, as needed, in the Committee's  sole discretion.  
[END TABLE]
Role of Executive Officers. The CEO makes recommendations to the Committee as requested on plan design, financial and strategic performance goals, performance and compensation recommendations for other NEOs, and management transitions and succession. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant. The Committee retained Pay Governance LLC, a nationally-recognized independent compensation consulting firm, to assist in performing its duties. Pay Governance does not provide other services to the Company or the Company's management. In fiscal year 2018, Pay Governance advised the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation trends and best practices, competitive pay levels, equity grant practices and competitive levels, annual and long-term incentive design, peer group benchmarking, incentive plan design, equity plan share authorization request, and Proxy Statement disclosure.  Independence of the Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee has determined that Pay Governance is independent, and the services provided by Pay Governance during fiscal 2018 did not raise any conflict of interests. In reaching these conclusions, the Compensation Committee considered the factors set forth in Rule 10C-1 of the Exchange Act and applicable listing standards. 
Considerations in Setting Executive Compensation. Generally, in determining base salary, target annual incentives and long-term equity awards, the Compensation Committee considers several factors including, but not limited to the executive's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• role including the scope and complexity of responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience and capabilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contributions or responsibilities beyond the typical scope of the role;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• individual performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• internal comparisons; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• competitive compensation opportunities as reflected in compensation provided by our peers and other competitors  for similar executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Peer Group and Market Analysis. The Compensation Committee uses a compensation peer group to monitor the compensation practices of our primary competitors for executive talent. The Compensation Committee's compensation consultant reviews the companies in the peer group annually and proposes changes in response to mergers and acquisitions, significant movements in revenues or market capitalization, and revised business strategies. The Committee used the following general criteria to identify potential peers to inform recommendations for fiscal year 2018 compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• U.S. publicly traded companies from the Healthcare Equipment & Supplies or Life Sciences  Tools & Services industries  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies in a relevant range around Varian's revenues and market-capitalization  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies with similar business characteristics and comparable talent requirements, such as complex medical or  related electronic devices, significant non-U.S. revenues, and employee headcount generally in a reasonable range around Varian's headcount  
[END TABLE]
Using this selection criteria, the Compensation Committee determined to remove St. Jude Medical from the prior year Peer Group due to acquisition. Accordingly, our Peer Group for fiscal 2018 compensation decisions comprised the following 16 companies who compete in industries that the Compensation Committee believes reflects the competitive market for executive talent similar to that required by the Company.

• Financial Performance  
[END TABLE]
In fiscal year 2018, 80% of MIP awards were based on financial results relative to goals set by the Compensation Committee. The Committee selected an economic profit metric as the fiscal year 2018 financial performance measure because it incentivizes both growth and return on the capital invested in our business. Economic profit aligns with a key component of Varian's growth and value creation strategy, which is to drive innovation over relatively long product cycles through ongoing investments in R&D. Our economic profit metric encourages management to make prudent R&D investments by capitalizing the costs and not treating them as an expense in the current year. However, management is accountable for earning a return on cumulative R&D investments over time as capitalized R&D expenses are charged a cost of capital in determining economic profit. 
Economic Profit is a common term referred to in proxies and is an understood metric in major U.S. corporations. In summary, using an economic profit measure has the following benefits:

 In general, economic profit equals our gross cash earnings ("GCE") in excess of the required return on our gross operating assets ("GOA") used to generate those cash earnings. Improvement in excess GCE drives increases in share price. Varian's economic profit is calculated from the Company's audited financial results, as illustrated below:

GCE includes add-backs for R&D expense and depreciation and amortization. GOA includes capitalized R&D, net working capital (such as inventory and accounts receivable), and other gross operating assets (such as property, plant and equipment). Cumulative R&D spending over the prior eight years (approximating our product life cycles) is treated as an asset on which management must earn a return above the cost of capital. Cost of capital is also charged on gross and not depreciated operating assets to avoid an artificial upward drift in economic profit which would occur if these assets were depreciating away. The Compensation Committee believes that this methodology is an appropriate way to align measurement of growth and profitability with our strategy for growth and value creation. 
The fiscal 2018 MIP payout schedule and results are set out in the following table. Our fiscal year 2018 economic profit of $455 million was an improvement of $81 million over fiscal year 2017 adjusted actual economic profit, and exceeded the economic profit required for a maximum payout of 200% of target incentives for the 80% of the MIP award that is based on financial results.

 As shown in the summary financial highlights, the key drivers of GCE were revenue growth and gross margin expansion resulting in $142 million, or +47%, increase in GAAP operating earnings. In addition, management reduced GOA attributable to both days sales outstanding, down 6 days, and days sales inventory, down 8 days, which mitigated the impact of growth in net working capital associated with increased revenues.

• Performance Stock Options (PSOs)  
[END TABLE]
As described in the Executive Summary above, the Committee determined to increase the alignment of CEO pay with our strategy for growth and stockholder value creation by making all his fiscal 2018 equity awards subject to achievement of rigorous financial targets. This was accomplished by granting 60% of his total long-term equity grant value in the form of PSOs and the remaining 40% of his grant value in PSUs as described below. The Committee believes that the higher risk of vesting in the PSOs in return for a higher potential gain from an option vehicle is an appropriate incentive for the CEO. 
The PSOs granted to the CEO in fiscal year 2018 have a seven-year term and an exercise price equal to the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant. The intended grant value was converted into stock options using the Black Scholes value and assumptions described in footnote 3 of the Summary Compensation Table (refer to "Summary Compensation Table" below). The PSOs vest based on achievement of the three-year   performance targets established for the fiscal 2018 Performance Share Unit awards (see description below). The PSU Payout Matrix is used to determine the percentage of the target number of PSOs that will vest subject to a maximum of 200% of the target number of PSOs. The options vest and become exercisable when Company performance is certified after the end of fiscal 2020. The CEO must be employed by us throughout the vesting date for vesting to occur on such date, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability, a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if the award is not assumed in connection with certain corporate transactions. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information.

• Performance Share Units (PSUs)  
[END TABLE]
The number of shares earned under the fiscal year 2018 PSUs will be calculated as set forth below.

Revenue Growth + Change in EBIT Margin Payout Matrix 
The number of PSUs earned is calculated from the following performance matrix: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    3 - Year Change in EBIT as Percent of Revenue       3-Year Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate 
    3 - Year Change in EBIT as Percent of Revenue       3-Year Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate 
[END TABLE]
The targets for 3-Year Revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate and 3-Year Change in EBIT as a Percent of Revenue in the payout matrix were set based on the median results of our Business Model Peers (see Business Mode Peer list under the Relative TSR Modifier section below). The PSU payout is 0% for 3-Year Revenue Compound Annual Growth below 0% or 3-Year Change in EBIT as a Percentage of Revenue below -4%. Payouts for intermediate results are determined by linear interpolation. For plan purposes, EBIT is calculated as earnings before reduction for interest and taxes, subject to adjustments adopted by the Compensation Committee at the time the goals were set. 
Relative TSR Modifier 
The relative TSR modifier (the "Relative TSR Modifier") sets maximums and minimums for the number of PSUs earned based on Varian's 3-year TSR rank relative to a selected set of Business Model Peers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A 100% payout minimum is applied when Varian's 3-year TSR ranks  above 75th percentile  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A 100% payout maximum is applied when Varian's 3-year TSR ranks  below 25th percentile  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Relative TSR Modifier does not apply if Varian's 3-year TSR  ranks between 25th and 75th percentile.  
[END TABLE]
 The Business Model Peers were selected from companies in the healthcare industry based on ten financial and scope metrics, including size, growth, margins, returns, reinvestment rates, asset intensity, economic profit volatility, and TSR. The peers selected were similar to Varian on at least five of the ten criteria. The Compensation Committee believes that the 51 companies in the Business Model Peer Group at fiscal year end 2018 represent a relevant and sufficiently broad group of companies for the purposes of calibrating the PSU performance matrix (presented above) and ranking Varian TSR for the Relative TSR Modifier.

• Settlement of PSUs Awarded in Fiscal Year 2016  
[END TABLE]
During fiscal year 2016, the long-term incentive grant value mix for our executives was shifted to grant 60% of total grant value in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs). This was accomplished by making two grants of PSUs, one in November 2015 and another in February 2016.  Both grants are subject to attainment of EPS and relative TSR results as summarized below. In addition, the PSUs granted in February 2016 were subject to a threshold performance achievement of $7.5 billion revenue for the 33-month period of January 2, 2016 through September 28, 2018 for any shares to be earned. The revenue threshold for the 33-month period was met. 
Once it was determined that the threshold revenue requirement was met, the number of shares earned from the fiscal 2016 PSU awards was calculated as illustrated below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Earned PSUs   =    Target PSUs   x        3 - Year Average of Annual EPS Growth Payout Percentages   +     Relative TSR Adjustment Percentage

EPS results. Annual EPS was measured relative to targets established for each year at the beginning of that year*. The EPS targets and results were subject to certain adjustment provisions adopted by the Compensation Committee at the time the goal was established. The PSU payout earned was the average of the payouts calculated for the three years in the performance period. The calculation of the fiscal 2016 PSU average payout percentage is set out below.

*  Fiscal year 2016 adjusted EPS goals were set and measured prior to the spinoff of Varex Imaging Corporation  from the Company and fiscal year 2016 and 2017 adjusted EPS goals were set and measured under ASC 605 accounting rules. Fiscal year 2018 adjusted EPS goals were set and measured under ASC 606 accounting rules. Thresholds for fiscal year  2017 and fiscal year 2018 were set above prior year actuals after adjustment for the spinoff and/or accounting rule changes. Adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2016 was calculated from the Company's GAAP diluted EPS of $4.19, which was adjusted  downward by $0.09 (on account of the budgeted exchange rate established for fiscal year 2016 and exclusion of the impact of unplanned share buybacks) and upward by $0.48 (to exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, litigation  expenses, restructuring charges, separation costs, impairment charges, and acquisition costs, pursuant to adjustment provisions which were approved by the Compensation Committee at the time such EPS goal was approved).  
[END TABLE]
Adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2017 was calculated from the Company's GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75, which was adjusted upward by $0.06 (on account of the budgeted exchange rate established for fiscal year 2017) and upward by $0.85 (to exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, litigation expenses, restructuring charges, impairment changes, and acquisition costs, pursuant to adjustment provisions which were approved by the Compensation Committee at the time such EPS goal was approved). 
Adjusted EPS for fiscal year 2018 was calculated from the Company's GAAP diluted EPS of $1.62, which was adjusted downward by $0.03 (on account of the budgeted exchange rate established for fiscal year 2018) and upward by $2.80 (to account for items pursuant to adjustment provisions which were approved by the Compensation Committee at the time such EPS goal was approved). Adjusted EPS excludes the amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and benefits, restructuring and impairment charges, significant litigation charges or benefits and legal costs, and significant non-recurring tax expense   or benefit, which can be found in our GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in our 2018 fourth quarter earnings press release which is included as an exhibit to the Form 8-K that was furnished to the SEC on October 23, 2018. 
Relative TSR Modifier. The Company's TSR ranking relative to the companies comprising the Dow Jones U.S. Medical Equipment Index was used to determine a multiplier to the EPS Growth Goal Payout Percentage. TSR was measured for the three-year period consisting of fiscal years 2016-2018. Varian's 3-year TSR was 62.24%, which ranked at the 29th percentile and resulted in a -25% adjustment to the EPS results, as set out in the following table.

• Stock Options (SO)  
[END TABLE]
The stock options granted in fiscal year 2018 have an exercise price equal to the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant and have a seven-year term. The intended grant value was converted into stock options using the Black Scholes value and assumptions described in footnote 3 of the Summary Compensation Table (refer to "Summary Compensation Table" below). The first 33 1/3% of the stock options vest 12 months from the grant date, and the remainder vest in equal monthly installments during the following 24-month period. A recipient must be employed by us throughout each vesting date for vesting to occur on such date, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability, a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if the award is not assumed in connection with certain corporate transactions. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Units (RSU)  
[END TABLE]
The RSUs granted in fiscal year 2018 vest and are settled in equal numbers of shares of our common stock on approximately the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The intended grant value was converted into RSUs using the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant. As is the case for stock options, a recipient must be employed by us through each vesting date for vesting to occur on such date, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability, a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if the award is not assumed in connection with certain corporate transactions. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information. 
Other Elements of Executive Compensation 
Because our philosophy is to emphasize pay for performance, we provide retirement, group benefits and perquisites of relatively minor value to our executives. 
401(k) Contributions. The Company makes matching contributions to the NEO's contributions to the Company's 401(k) plan, matched at the same level and subject to the same caps as for all employees. 
Deferred Compensation Plan. We offer a Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") to certain employees, including eligible NEOs, under which participants may elect to defer a portion of their base salary and annual performance-based cash bonus. We offer the DCP because we believe it is a competitive element of compensation for eligible participants. 
Group Benefits and Perquisites. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the same employee benefit plans and on the same basis as all other Company employees. In addition, our NEOs receive limited supplemental   benefits and perquisites. During fiscal year 2018, we provided (i) reimbursement to the CEO for financial counseling and reimbursement of up to $6,500 to other NEOs for financial counseling, and (ii) reimbursement of up to $4,000 for an annual executive physical. NEOs may participate in the Company's charitable giving program, in which the company will match donations dollar for dollar up to a maximum of $10,000 per employee per year. In addition, for NEOs who choose to contribute to the Company's Political Action Committee, the contribution will be matched with a charity or educational institution contribution, dollar for dollar up to $5,000. Mr. Wilson's spouse and family members are permitted to ride along on the Company's leased aircraft when the aircraft is already going to a specific destination for a business purpose, provided there is no more than de minimis incremental cost. However, Mr. Wilson's family members did not accompany Mr. Wilson for any travel on the Company's leased aircraft in fiscal 2018. 
Pursuant to our policy, the Company does not provide executives tax gross-ups or reimbursements for any taxable income from these benefits and perquisites, except for tax restoration benefits in connection with the relocation of new executives. 
Change in Control Agreements. We currently have change-in-control agreements with 10 executives, including our NEOs. We entered into these agreements to attract and retain highly-qualified executives and to incentivize executives who might be involved in acquisition or merger discussions with another entity to make decisions that are in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders, without being unduly biased by the impact of such a transaction on their personal situations. These agreements do not factor into our decisions surrounding the executive's cash and equity compensation. 
Each change-in-control agreement contains a "better after-tax" provision, which provides that if any of the payments to the executive constitutes a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, the payments will either be (i) reduced or (ii) provided in full to the executive, whichever results in the executive receiving the greater amount after taking into consideration the payment of all taxes, including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. The agreements do not include "golden parachute" tax gross up payments for excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Code. 
The change-in-control agreements are intended to provide an appropriate level of compensation for a specified time interval for executives who would likely be involved in activities regarding a change in control and are personally at risk for job loss in the event of a change in control. Our change-in-control agreements are "double-trigger" meaning that to receive benefits under the agreements there must be a change-in-control event and the executive must either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)    Be  terminated by us or the successor company without cause within a specified time interval in connection with a  change in control, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)    Terminate  employment for good reason, as defined in the agreements, within a specified time interval in connection with a  change in control.  
[END TABLE]
For more information about the agreements as well as a tabular summary of the potential payments that may be made to our NEOs, please refer to "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control."  Executive Compensation Governance Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. As noted above, a core element of our compensation philosophy is to align the interests of executive officers with those of stockholders by providing appropriate long-term incentives. To further this goal, the Company maintains stock ownership guidelines based on the value of our common stock owned as a multiple of base salary. The guidelines are reviewed annually and revised upward as appropriate to keep pace with competitive and good governance practices. The multiples are set based upon each officer's position, as set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  CEO    6x 
  Next four most highly compensated executive officers    3x 
  Other corporate officers    2x 
[END TABLE]
The program counts for purposes of stock ownership: shares owned, unvested restricted stock, RSUs, and earned and vested performance shares. Ownership levels are expected to be achieved within the later of: (i) five years of first becoming an officer, (ii) three years of an amendment increasing ownership levels with respect to any increase, or (iii) three years of the date that the new ownership levels apply to such individual due to a change in position or becoming an NEO. One-third of the ownership level is expected to be achieved within two-and-one-half years after an individual becomes subject to the ownership guidelines. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all the NEOs met the guidelines or were on track to comply in the relevant timeframe. 
Recoupment (or "Clawback") Policy. The Board has adopted a formal policy to recover certain incentive payments and equity awards if we are required to restate our financial statements as a result of an executive officer engaging in misconduct or other violations of our Code of Conduct that caused or partially caused the restatement. In the event of a restatement, the Board will review the conduct of the executive officer in relation to the restatement. If the Board determines that an executive officer has engaged in misconduct or other violations of our Code of Conduct, the Board can, in its discretion, take appropriate action, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, to remedy the misconduct, including, without limitation, seeking reimbursement of any portion of performance-based or incentive compensation paid or awarded to the executive that is greater than would have been paid or awarded if calculated based on the restated financial results. Such action by the Board would be in addition to any other actions the Board or we may take under our other policies, as modified from time to time, or any actions imposed by law enforcement, regulators or other authorities. 
This recoupment policy is incorporated into the provisions of our MIP and Fifth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Plan. Under our current stock option agreements, if an employee commences employment with a company that competes with us in any of our businesses, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate the stock option agreement, including the vesting of any options or other grants which remain unvested as of the date the employee commences employment with the competitor. 
Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging Company Securities and Insider Trading Policy. The Board has approved a corporate insider trading policy to prohibit officers and directors from purchasing Company securities on margin and borrowing against Company securities, and prohibits officers, directors and other employees subject to the quarterly blackout period from engaging in transactions in puts, calls, other derivatives and hedging transactions. 
Equity Grant Practices. On November 16, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a formal equity grant policy. Effective January 1, 2018, under the terms of the policy, grants of equity awards to employees and consultants will be approved at Compensation Committee meetings that are scheduled in writing by the Company at least six months in advance of the applicable approval date. Such grants will become effective on the date such grants are approved by the Compensation Committee (or on the next trading day following such approval date if the approval date is not a trading day). However, if our trading "blackout" is in effect, any equity awards to be made to executive officers other than in connection with their hire will instead become effective on the second business day (or such shorter period determined by our legal department) following the public release of the   corresponding material, non-public information. If extraordinary circumstances arise such that the Compensation Committee determines it is advisable to grant an equity award that will be approved and/or become effective on a date other than the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may consider and approve such alternative date(s), provided that the grant effective date of such award must occur during an open trading window under the Company's insider trading policies. 
The exercise price of our stock options is the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant. If the date of grant falls on a day upon which the NYSE is closed, then the exercise price is the closing price of our common stock on the next trading date. Our Fifth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Plan explicitly prohibits the repricing and cash-out of underwater stock options without prior stockholder approval. 
Compensation Risk Management. The Compensation Committee's annual review and approval of the Company's compensation philosophy and strategy includes the review of compensation-related risk management. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's compensation programs for employees and executives, including the annual cash incentive plans and long-term, equity-based incentive awards, and does not believe that such compensation programs create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
As part of this review, Pay Governance reviewed our compensation programs and reported that the programs provide an appropriate pay philosophy, peer group, and benchmarking to support business objectives with meaningful risk mitigation, oversight and discretion by the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance also advised that the Company's executive compensation programs provide an effective balance in cash and equity mix, short- and long-term performance focus, corporate, business unit and individual performance focus, and financial performance measurement that avoids the taking of short-term risks at the expense of long-term stockholder interests. The report also determined that the Company's principal sales incentive plan is based on measurable and verifiable sales goals that are aligned with company-wide goals for its annual cash incentive plan for executives. In addition, total target incentive compensation for all employees is a small percentage of total sales and revenue, and incentive opportunities under these plans are capped. Management also retains discretion to reduce incentive amounts. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the following risk oversight and compensation design features described in greater detail above in this CD&A safeguard against excessive risk taking: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership requirements  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recoupment policy  
[END TABLE]

• Prohibitions on employees engaging in any speculative transactions in Company securities, such as hedging

• Prohibitions on executive officers from pledging Company securities in margin accounts or as collateral for a  loan

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSU awards are also based on multi-year relative TSR goals  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All equity awards have vesting requirements that align employees' interests with stockholders   
[END TABLE]
Tax Deductibility. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct as a business expense in any year with respect to certain of our most highly paid executive officers. Historically, there has been an exemption from this $1 million deduction limit for compensation payments that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m). Generally, in the past we have designed our executive compensation program to permit the Compensation   Committee to award compensation intended to be eligible for deductibility to the extent permitted by Section 162(m) and the relevant IRS regulations. With the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, the performance-based compensation exemption has been eliminated, except with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to maintain flexibility in our approach to executive compensation and to structure a program that we consider to be the most effective in attracting, motivating and retaining key executives. 
Compensation and Management Development Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company has reviewed and discussed with management the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1)  These columns represent the potential awards under our MIP as further discussed in "Compensation  Discussion and Analysis—Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Program and Pay Decisions—Annual Cash Incentives." For each NEO, the target amount is calculated by multiplying the NEO's target award percentage by the NEO's annual base  salary. The maximum award is 200% of each NEO's target award. The MIP did provide for a threshold amount in fiscal year 2018. The dollar value of the actual cash incentive award earned for fiscal year 2018 for each NEO is set forth in the  Summary Compensation Table (refer to "Summary Compensation Table" above). As such, the amounts set forth in these columns do not represent the actual cash incentive earned by any of the NEOs for fiscal year 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Consists of PSO and PSU grants to each NEO under the 2005 Stock Plan. The maximum number of PSOs or PSUs that  can be earned is 200% of the target PSOs or PSUs based on achievement of EPS goals modified by our TSR performance relative to the Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index. The determination of the number of PSUs earned is made at the end of the three-year  performance period at which time the earned PSUs vest and are settled. The determination of the number of PSOs earned is made at the end of the three-year performance period at which time the earned PSOs vest and become exercisable. Each NEO must be  employed by us throughout the performance period for his or her PSOs or PSUs to vest, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability, a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if the award is not assumed  in connection with certain corporate transactions. See the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information regarding these awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Consists of a single RSU grant to each NEO under the 2005 Stock Plan. Each RSU represents a right to one share  of our common stock. For Ms. Kennedy, Mr. Bischoping and Mr. Kuo, the RSUs vest and are settled in three equal annual increments on February 15th beginning one year after grant. For  each NEO, the vesting of his or her RSUs is subject to the NEO being employed by us through each vesting date, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability, a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if  the award is not assumed in connection with certain corporate transactions. See the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information regarding these  awards.

(2)  Vesting will occur only if the NEO is employed by us throughout each vesting date or in the case of performance  awards, the last day of the performance period, except in cases involving retirement, death, disability (in the case of awards granted after November 8, 2015), a qualified termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, or if  the award is not assumed in connection with certain corporate transactions. In particular, because Mr. Wilson, Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Kuo are eligible for retirement, certain unvested options, and unvested stock awards would continue to  vest according to the original vesting schedule even if the services of either were terminated for any reason. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for more information regarding these awards.

[END TABLE]
Our DCP is an unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation arrangement that is designed to allow directors, executive officers and certain other management and highly compensated employees to forego current compensation and defer a specified percentage of their base salaries (up to 50%), cash incentive payments (up to 100%) and director fees (applicable only to our non-employee directors) in a manner similar to the way in which our 401(k) plan operates, but without regard to the maximum deferral limitations imposed on 401(k) plans by the Code. Deferred amounts are our general unsecured obligations and are subject to claims by our creditors. Our general assets or assets in an existing rabbi trust may be used to fund our payment obligations and pay DCP benefits. The Compensation Committee administers the DCP. Further, we may, on a discretionary basis, make Company supplemental contributions equal to the product of (a) the excess of the participant's base annual salary and any applicable incentive payments for the fiscal year over the compensation limit imposed by   Section 401(a)(17) of the Code and (b) our matching contribution rate under the 401(k) (6%) ("Company Supplemental Contributions") and credit additional amounts on behalf of the DCP's participants (these discretionary contributions, together with the Company Supplemental Contributions, are referred to as "Company Contributions"). We did not make any Company Contributions in fiscal year 2018. 
Amounts deferred by a participant and Company Contributions, if any, are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of each participant. These bookkeeping accounts are utilized solely as a device for measuring and determining amounts to be paid to a participant, or his or her designated beneficiary, pursuant to the terms of the DCP. Amounts credited to each participant under the DCP are periodically adjusted for earnings and/or losses at a rate that is equal to the various investment funds (also referred to as measurement funds) selected by the Compensation Committee, as elected by the participant. The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, discontinue, substitute or add a measurement fund. Participants may reallocate previously invested money among each of the available measurement funds on a daily basis. 
Under the DCP, a participant may make separate distribution elections with respect to each year's deferrals. These distribution elections include the ability to elect a single lump-sum payment or installment payments for up to 15 years for employees who retire from the Company. Deferrals also may be paid out prior to a separation from service in the event of a financial hardship or if the participant makes a "short-term distribution election." A "short-term distribution election" must be made at the time the participant makes his or her initial deferral elections. Under the DCP, amounts credited as Company Supplemental Contributions are generally paid in the form of a lump sum following a participant's separation from service (except for those Company Supplemental Contributions made prior to December 31, 2004, which may still be paid in installments upon an employee's retirement). Non-retirement separations from service generally will result in payments being made in the form of single lump sums. 
We may terminate the DCP by action of the Board, in which event benefits will be distributed as soon as the plan and Section 409A of the Code permit. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Change in Control Agreements 
As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section above, we have entered into change in control agreements with our NEOs. Our change in control agreements are "double-trigger" meaning that to receive benefits under the agreements there must be a change in control event (as defined in each executive's agreement) and the executive must either be terminated by us or the successor company without cause (as defined in each executive's agreement) or terminate his or her employment for good reason (as defined in each executive's agreement). The termination must occur within 60 days prior to or 18 months following the change in control to trigger benefits. The agreements also provide for certain death and long-term disability benefits in the event of an individual's death or disability within 18 months after a change in control. Payments and benefits may be delayed six months following separation from service in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
Each change in control agreement contains a "better after-tax" provision, which provides that if any of the payments to the executive constitutes a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, the payments will either be (i) reduced or (ii) provided in full to the executive, whichever results in the executive receiving the greater amount after taking into consideration the payment of all taxes, including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. 
As a condition to receiving such severance benefits, the executive must execute a release of all of his or her rights and claims relating to his or her employment and comply with certain post-termination restrictions, including, among other things, continuing to comply with the terms of his or her proprietary information and non-disclosure agreement, and for a period of two years, complying with certain non-solicitation and non-competition provisions that are set forth in each executive's change in control agreement.  The table below reflects the value of compensation and benefits that would become payable to each of the NEOs under the agreements as of September 28, 2018, if a change in control had occurred on that date and the NEO experienced a qualifying termination of employment. These amounts are reported based on the NEO's compensation as of such date and based on the Company's closing stock price of $111.93 on September 28, 2018. These benefits are in addition to the right to exercise then-exercisable stock options, the amounts payable under the DCP as set forth in the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table above which the NEO would receive in the event of any termination, and the benefits available generally to salaried employees, such as distributions under the Company's broad based 401(k) plan. 
The actual amounts that would be paid upon a NEO's qualifying termination of employment in connection with a change in control can be determined only at the time of any such event. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon such an event, any actual amounts paid or distributed may be higher or lower than reported below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the Company's stock price and the executive's current base salary. 
The benefits payable upon a NEO's qualifying termination of employment in connection a change in control as reported in the columns of this table are as follows:

 Outstanding Equity Grants as of September 28, 2018 
Stock Options 
Under the terms of each NEO's stock option awards, if the NEO's employment terminates due to retirement, his or her unvested stock options will continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedules; provided however, that the number of shares subject to stock option awards granted within one year of the NEO's retirement will be adjusted proportionally by the time during such one-year period that the NEO remained an employee of the Company (based upon a 365-day year). If the NEO's service terminates due to death, his or her unvested stock options will fully vest on such termination date. In addition, for stock option awards granted on or after November 9, 2015, if the NEO's service terminates due to disability, his or her unvested stock options will fully vest on such termination date. Stock options may be exercisable for up to three years from the date the NEO's employment terminates due to retirement or death and one year from the date the NEO's employment terminates due to disability, unless in each case the stock option term expires earlier. 
RSU Awards 
Under the terms of each NEO's RSU awards, if the NEO's service terminates due to retirement one year or more from the grant date, then his or her RSU awards will continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedules. If the NEO retires within one year of the grant date of his or her RSU award but after January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such RSU award was granted, the number of RSUs subject to such award will be adjusted proportionally by the time during such one year period that the NEO remained an employee of the Company (based upon a 365-day year) and the adjusted RSU award will continue to vest in accordance with its original vesting schedule. If the NEO's service terminates due to death, his or her RSU awards will fully vest on such termination date. In addition, for RSU awards granted on or after November 9, 2015, if the NEO's service terminates due to disability, then his or her RSU awards will continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedules.  
PSO Awards 
Mr. Wilson was granted a PSO award in 2018. Under the terms of his award, if Mr. Wilson's service terminates due to retirement, death or disability, then he will be treated as though he was employed through the applicable performance period; provided however, that if Mr. Wilson retires within one year of his date of grant, the number of shares subject to his award will be adjusted proportionally by the time during such one-year period that he remained an employee of the Company (based upon a 365-day year). The actual number of PSOs that are earned in the event of retirement, death or disability will depend on the extent to which the applicable performance goals are achieved. If Mr. Wilson's service terminates due to disability, he may exercise his vested options within one year from the later of the date that the Compensation Committee certifies whether and to what the extent the applicable performance goals are achieved or the date that his service terminates, unless his PSO award expires earlier. If Mr. Wilson's service terminates due to retirement or death, he or his estate, as applicable, may exercise his vested options within three years from the later of the date that the Compensation Committee certifies whether and to the extent the applicable performance goals are satisfied or the date his service terminates, unless his PSO award expires earlier. 
PSU Awards 
Under the terms of each NEO's PSU awards, if the NEO's service terminates due to retirement, death or disability, then the NEO will be treated as though he or she was employed through the applicable performance period; provided however, that in the event of his or her retirement, the target number of PSUs will be adjusted proportionally based on the number of days that the NEO remained an employee during the performance period (based upon a 365 day year). The actual number of PSUs that are earned in such circumstances will depend on the extent to which the applicable performance goals are achieved. In addition, in the event of a change of control where such NEO's PSU awards are assumed, such awards will fully vest at target, subject to the NEO being   employed through the end of the performance period; provided however, that such awards will continue to be subject to the retirement, death and disability vesting provisions described above. Additionally, in the event of a change of control where such NEO's PSU awards are not assumed, such awards will fully vest at target, without being subject to any employment requirement. 
2005 Stock Plan 
Under the terms of the 2005 Stock Plan, except as otherwise provided in each NEO's equity agreements, in the event of certain corporate transactions, if the Compensation Committee does not provide for the assumption, continuation or substitution of stock awards, each NEO's stock awards will fully vest and terminate upon the consummation of the transaction, provided that holders of stock options or SARs will be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise their outstanding vested stock options and SARs before the termination of such awards.

Excludes value of RSUs granted on 2/8/2018, as the assumed  retirement/termination date of September 28, 2018 does not constitute a Qualifying Retirement for that award. For Mr. Wilson, also represents continued vesting of his unvested restricted stock award that was granted in 2005, assuming the  fiscal-year end closing price on the vesting date.

(2c)  For NEOs who shall be retirement-eligible on or prior to the last day of the performance period of each  outstanding PSU award, the number of shares subject to such PSU award would be adjusted on a prorated basis (based on the actual amount of time employed within each performance period). However, payouts remain subject to actual performance through  the end of each award's applicable performance period, thus awards continue to be subject to risk of forfeiture. $0's are shown as payouts remain subject to performance post-termination. Assuming target performance is met for all  outstanding awards, the intrinsic value of each NEO's accelerated PSU awards would be as follows:  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Wilson: $4,268,376     
Ms. Kennedy: $1,541,052     
Mr. Bischoping: $0 (Will not be retirement-eligible at the end of applicable outstanding performance period)

Because he is retirement-eligible and his outstanding PSO award was granted less than a year prior to September 28, 2018, the number of shares subject to such PSO award would be adjusted on a prorated basis (based on the actual amount of time employed between the grant date and the assumed retirement/termination date of September 28, 2018). However, payout remains subject to actual performance through the end of the award's applicable performance period, thus award continues to be subject to risk of forfeiture.  $0 is shown as payout remains subject to performance post-termination.

CEO Pay Ratio 
For fiscal year 2018, based on reasonable estimates, the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than our CEO) was $144,511 and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in our Summary Compensation Table, was $10,276,439. Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 71:1. 
Employees Included. The Company had approximately 7,074 employees worldwide as of September 28, 2018. In identifying the worldwide median employee, we included all our employees (except for our CEO). 
Selecting Median Employee. In identifying the median employee, we used fiscal year 2018 base salary / wages (in each case annualized for regular part-time employees and full-time employees who joined during the fiscal year). No adjustments were made for cost of living or low compensation standards in any countries. Pay for non-U.S. employees was converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates as of September 28, 2018. There were multiple employees who received the same median salary, so we selected the employee with the most common set of compensation components. 
Compensation Included. CEO annual total compensation is the amount reported in this proxy in the Summary Compensation Table for total compensation which includes base salary, non-equity incentive plan compensation, stock awards, option awards, and all other compensation. Total annual compensation for the median employee for fiscal year 2018 includes base salary wages, overtime wages, annual incentive, car plan benefit and company matching contributions to the employee's 401(k) plan, resulting in total annual compensation of $144,511. 
Compensation of Directors 
The compensation of directors is determined by the full Board. Directors who are employees (i.e., Mr. Wilson) receive no compensation for their services as directors. The Compensation Committee periodically initiates a review of the non-employee director compensation (including cash retainer and meeting fees and equity awards) and recommends changes to the full Board. Changes to non-employee director compensation are generally made to ensure that compensation levels are market-competitive and that the compensation structure supports our business objectives, aligns directors' interests with the interests of stockholders, reflects competitive best practice and is cost-and-tax-effective.

Non-employee directors may elect to receive their cash compensation as full-value shares of our common stock, at a value equal to the fair market value on the date that the foregone cash compensation otherwise would have been paid. They may alternatively elect to defer their retainers and/or meeting fees under our DCP, subject to the restrictions of applicable tax law. All earnings on amounts deferred under the DCP are not preferential or above market. Please refer to the discussion in "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" above for more information.  We maintain stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors. Under these guidelines, each non-employee director is expected to own shares valued at five times the annual cash Board retainer which for this purpose includes shares subject to stock unit awards. Ownership levels are to be achieved within five years from the date upon which an individual becomes a non-employee Director, within three years of the amendment to the ownership levels described above, or within three years of an amendment to non-employee Director compensation that increases the annual retainer fees payable to non-employee Directors by 25% or greater, whichever is later. One third of the guideline must be achieved within the first two and a half years after an individual becomes subject to the non-employee director compensation program. 
In addition, in February 2017, our stockholders approved a limit on the total value of cash and equity compensation that may be paid or granted to a non-employee director during each fiscal year. Currently, the maximum number of shares subject to stock awards granted during a single fiscal year under the 2005 Omnibus Stock Plan or otherwise, if any, taken together with any cash fees paid during such fiscal year for services on the Board of Directors, will not exceed $625,000 in total value for any non-employee director serving as the lead director or chair and $525,0000 in total value for any other non-employee director.

Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation 
Effective January 1, 2018, our Board revised our non-employee director compensation program to provide that (i) each non-employee director who is not the Chair of a committee will receive an additional annual retainer paid in quarterly installments for his or her service on a Board committee (instead of meeting fees for each committee meeting that he or she attends), and (ii) each non-employee director will receive RSUs with a grant date fair value of $165,000 that cliff-vest (100% vest) upon the earlier of one year from the grant date or the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders (instead of DSUs with a grant date fair value of $160,000 that vest quarterly). In addition, the chair of the Compensation Committee will receive a $19,000 annual retainer, an increase of $4,000. Such changes to our non-employee director compensation program were made to better reflect market practice and to appropriately compensate our non-employee directors for their time, commitment and contributions to the Board. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of this committee was at any time during fiscal 2018 or at any other time an officer or employee of the Company, and no member of this committee had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. No executive officer of the Company has served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions 
The Nominating Committee is responsible for the review, approval or ratification of "related person transactions" between the Company or its subsidiaries and related persons. Under SEC rules, a related person is a director, nominee for director or executive officer since the beginning of the last fiscal year, or a more than five percent stockholder, and their immediate family members. Such transactions may include employment or consulting relationships with a related person or contracts under which we receive goods or services from (or provide goods and services to) a related person or a company for which the related person is an employee or otherwise affiliated. The Board has adopted written policies and procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is a participant and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. Generally for a transaction to be approved, the Nominating Committee must be informed or have knowledge of (i) the related person's relationship to the Company and interest in the transaction; (ii) the material facts of the proposed transaction, including a description of the nature and potential aggregate value of the proposed transaction; (iii) the benefits, if any, to the Company of the proposed transaction; (iv) if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; and (v) an assessment of whether the proposed transaction or situation is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally. 
The Nominating Committee has, however, determined that a related person does not have a direct or indirect material interest in the following categories of transactions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction with another company for which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other  than an executive officer), director, or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company's shares, if the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million, or 2% of that company's total annual revenue, and the related  person is not involved in the decision-making process for such transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by the Company to a charitable organization, foundation or  university for which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer) or a director, if the amount involved does not exceed the lesser of $1 million, or 2% of the charitable organization's total  annual receipts, and the related person is not involved in the decision-making process for such transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation to executive officers determined by the Compensation Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation to directors determined by the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transactions in which all security holders receive proportional benefits.  
[END TABLE]
Transactions involving related persons that are not included in one of the above categories are forwarded to our legal department to determine whether the related person could have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction, and any such transaction is forwarded to the Nominating Committee for review. The Nominating Committee determines whether the related person has a material interest in a transaction and may approve, ratify, terminate or take other action with respect to the transaction in its discretion.
