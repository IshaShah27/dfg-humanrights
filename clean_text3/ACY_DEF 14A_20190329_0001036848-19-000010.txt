PROXY STATEMENT FOR
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON MAY 9, 2019
This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card are furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of         AEROCENTURY CORP. (the "Company" or "AeroCentury") of proxies to be voted at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2019 Annual Meeting" or the "Annual Meeting"), which will be held at 12:00 p.m. (local time) on May 9, 2019, at the         Hiller Aviation Museum, 601 Skyway Road, San Carlos, California, or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice"). You do not need to attend         the meeting to vote your shares.  Instead, you may simply complete, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card.  This Proxy Statement and the proxy card were first mailed to stockholders on or about March 25, 2019.
The Company's 2018 Annual Report, which includes its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, was mailed to         stockholders concurrently with this Proxy Statement.  The 2018 Annual Report is not to be regarded as proxy soliciting material or as a communication by means of which any solicitation of proxies is to be made.
VOTING MATTERS AND SOLICITATION
Record Date and Required Quorum
The close of business on March 11, 2019, was the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual         Meeting.  As of that date, the Company had 1,545,884 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), outstanding.  The presence at the Annual Meeting of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, or 772,943         shares, either present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.  All of the shares of the Company's Common Stock outstanding on the record date are entitled to vote at the         2019 Annual Meeting, and stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will have one vote for each share of Common Stock so held with regard to each matter to be voted upon.
How to Cast and Revoke Your Vote
Voting if you are the Registered Holder of           Shares.  If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Co., you are considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to these shares and the Company is         sending these proxy materials directly to you.  As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company by completing the enclosed proxy card or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  To grant your         voting proxy, you should complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card to the Company.
Voting if you Hold Shares in a Brokerage or           Other Nominee Account.  If your shares are held by a broker or by a bank or other nominee (each, a "Nominee") in a brokerage or other account, then you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held "in street name."  Your Nominee         is considered the stockholder of record with respect to these shares and has forwarded these proxy materials to you.  As the beneficial owner of your shares, you have the right to direct your Nominee on how to vote.  To direct your Nominee on how         to vote your shares, you must follow the procedure explained in the materials provided to you by your Nominee, which procedure generally consists of completing and returning to your Nominee a voting instruction form that was sent to you by your         Nominee along with this Proxy Statement. Your Nominee may also have provided information on how to give voting instructions to the Nominee by telephone or online through the Internet.  Notwithstanding that your Nominee will be voting your shares on         your behalf and as instructed by you, you may still attend the Annual Meeting.  If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and want to vote your shares in person rather than have your Nominee vote your shares on your behalf, you must obtain from your         Nominee a proxy card issued in your name with respect to your shares.
Effect of Returning the Proxy Card to the           Company.  Shares of the Company's Common Stock represented by proxies in the accompanying form that are properly executed and returned to the Company will be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the         stockholder of record contained therein.  In the absence of contrary instructions, shares represented by such proxies will be voted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· FOR the election of the director nominee as described herein under "Proposal 1: Election of Director";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· FOR approval, in an advisory (non-binding) vote, of the Company's executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement as                    described herein under "Proposal 2:  Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· FOR once every 1 YEAR, in an advisory (non-binding) vote on the frequency with which stockholders will vote on the Company's                    executive compensation (once every 1, 2 or 3 years) as described herein under "Proposal 3:  Advisory Vote on Frequency of an Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation"; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· FOR ratification of the selection of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm as described                    herein under "Proposal 4: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."  
[END TABLE]
The Company does not know of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those set forth in this Proxy Statement and in the         Notice accompanying this Proxy Statement.  If other matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.  Proxies will confer upon the proxy holders         discretionary authority to vote upon matters that may properly be raised at the Annual Meeting but are unknown to the Company as of the date hereof.  In addition, proxies will confer upon the proxy holders the authority to adjourn or postpone the         Annual Meeting if necessary or advisable to permit further solicitation of proxies in the event there are insufficient shares present to constitute a quorum or insufficient votes at the time of the Annual Meeting to approve any or all of the         foregoing items of business.
Revocation of a Previously Submitted Proxy.          Any stockholder of record has the right to revoke his or her proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Delivering to the Company (to the attention of Toni M. Perazzo, Secretary, 1440 Chapin Avenue, Suite 310, Burlingame, California                    94010) a written notice of revocation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Delivering to the Company (to the attention of Toni M. Perazzo, Secretary, 1440 Chapin Avenue, Suite 310, Burlingame, California                    94010) a duly executed proxy or voting instructions bearing a later date than the proxy being revoked; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
Any beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock held in street name should follow the instructions provided by your Nominee regarding how to         revoke a previously submitted proxy.
Broker Non-Votes
Effect of Broker Non-Votes.  A         "broker non-vote" occurs when a beneficial owner fails to give its Nominee voting instructions on a proposal and the Nominee lacks discretionary power to vote uninstructed shares on that proposal. Broker non-votes are, in all cases, counted for         purposes of determining a quorum for the Annual Meeting.  Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, however, whether a broker non-vote will occur depends upon whether a proposal is "routine" or "non-routine", as discussed below.
Non-Routine Matters Presented at the 2019           Annual Meeting.  The election of directors (Proposal 1), the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 2), and the advisory vote on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 3) are considered         "non-routine" proposals.  As a result, if you are a beneficial owner of your shares of Common Stock, your failure to provide voting           instructions to your Nominee in the manner directed by your Nominee will result in your shares not being voted by the Nominee on any of these proposals.  Your Nominee has enclosed or otherwise provided to you a voting instruction form for         you to use in directing the Nominee on how to vote your shares.  Your Nominee may also have provided information regarding how to give voting instructions through the Internet or by telephone.
Routine Matters Presented at the 2019 Annual           Meeting.  The ratification of the selection of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal 4) is currently considered a "routine" proposal. As a result, your         Nominee has discretionary voting power to vote your shares on this proposal even if you fail to provide voting instructions to your Nominee regarding this proposal.  Accordingly, broker non-votes are not expected to occur in the vote on this         proposal.
Voting Requirements
Stockholder Vote Required to Approve           Proposal 1.  The election of directors will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the election and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. The nominee         receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes of the shares present in person, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected, provided a quorum is present.  Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will         not be counted toward a nominee's total and will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.
Stockholder Vote Required to Approve           Proposal 2.  The proposal to approve the Company's executive compensation will be approved in an advisory (non-binding) vote if the votes cast in favor exceed the votes cast against the proposal.  Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any,         will not be counted as either a vote "For" or "Against" Proposal 2 and thus will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Stockholder Vote Required to Approve           Proposal 3.  The proposal to approve the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation will be determined in a non-binding advisory vote by the interval (1, 2 or 3 years) receiving the greatest number of votes cast.  Abstentions         and broker non-votes will not be counted as a vote for any of 1 year, 2 years or 3 years with respect to Proposal 3 and thus will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Stockholder Vote Required to Approve           Proposal 4.  The proposal to ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will be approved if the votes cast in favor exceed the votes cast against the proposal.  Abstentions and         broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as either a vote "For" or "Against" Proposal 4 and thus will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Proxy Solicitation
The entire cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company.  Proxies will be solicited principally through the use of the mails, but,         if deemed desirable, may be solicited personally or by telephone, email, or special letter by officers and Company employees for no additional compensation.  Although we have not engaged employees for the specific purpose of soliciting proxies or a         proxy solicitation firm to assist us in soliciting proxies, we may elect to engage and pay the cost of such employees or such a proxy solicitation firm at any time.  Arrangements may be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and         fiduciaries to send proxies and other proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Company's Common Stock, and such persons may be reimbursed for their expenses.
HOUSEHOLDING OF ANNUAL MEETING MATERIALS
The Company is, and some Nominees may also be, participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports.  This         means that only one copy of this Proxy Statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report may have been sent to multiple stockholders sharing the same household, unless contrary instructions have been received from one or more of the stockholders.  The         Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of either such document, and the same documents for the Company's future annual stockholder meetings if requested, to any stockholder who contacts the Company's Investor Relations Department at (650)         340-1888 or by mail to 1440 Chapin Avenue, Suite 310, Burlingame, California 94010.  If stockholders sharing an address are receiving multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report at the stockholders' household and         would like to receive only a single copy of the Company's proxy materials in the future, the stockholders should contact their Nominee, or the Company's Investor Relations Department as described above to request delivery of a single copy of the         Company's proxy materials.
PROPOSAL 1:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
One of the Company's five directors will be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors has nominated the nominee set forth         below.  The proxy holders intend to vote all proxies received by them in the accompanying form "FOR" the director nominee listed below, unless instructions to the contrary are marked on the proxy.  In the event that the nominee is unable or         declines to serve as a director at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting, proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy.  As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors is         not aware that the nominee listed below is unable or will decline to serve as a director.  The term of office of a person elected as a director at the Annual Meeting will continue until the Company's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until         his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until the director's earlier resignation or removal.
Nominee to Board of Directors
Mr. Evan M. Wallach, age 64.  Mr.         Wallach is President and Chief Executive Officer of Global Airfinance Services, Inc., an aviation consulting business he founded in 1998 and returned to in June 2012.  Mr. Wallach is the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Company, and a member         of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Executive Committee.  He has served on the Board since 1997 and was appointed Chair in 2016.  From December 2009 until June 2012, Mr. Wallach was Managing Director, Aviation/Transportation         Markets at Jefferies & Company, Inc.  From 2005 to 2009, Mr. Wallach was a Managing Director, Airline/Aircraft Securities Sales at Guggenheim Capital Markets, LLC, a securities broker/dealer.  From 2001 to 2005, he served as Managing Director,         Fixed Income Institutional Sales, at Piper Jaffray LLC, and from 1998 to 2001 he served as Vice President, Finance of C-S Aviation Inc., an aviation consulting firm.  Mr. Wallach has specialized in aircraft and airline financing for over thirty         years, having held senior level positions with The CIT Group, Bankers Trust Company, Kendall Capital Partners, Drexel Burnham Lambert, and American Express Aircraft Leasing.  Mr. Wallach received a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science from State         University of New York at Stony Brook and a Master's Degree in Business Administration from the University of Michigan.
The Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Wallach should serve as a director of the Company because of his knowledge of the Company's         business and history and his expertise in aircraft finance.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE DIRECTOR NOMINEE LISTED ABOVE.
PROPOSAL 2:  ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company is requesting your advisory approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Summary         Compensation Table and narrative discussion set forth in this Proxy Statement.  This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a "say on pay" vote and is required to be conducted pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of         1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  You are encouraged to carefully review the information concerning the compensation of the Company's named executive officers set forth in this Proxy Statement under "Information Regarding the Company's         Directors and Officers—Executive Compensation."
The Company asks you to indicate your support for the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in this Proxy         Statement.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and the practices described in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation         disclosure rules.  Accordingly, the Company requests that you vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the         Company's Proxy Statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is hereby approved on an advisory, non-binding basis."
While the results of this advisory say on pay vote are not binding, the Board of Directors will consider the outcome of the vote in deciding         whether to take any action as a result of the vote and when making future compensation decisions for the Company's named executive officers.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS         DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
You are being provided with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on how frequently the Company should seek an advisory vote on the         compensation of its named executive officers.  Under this Proposal 3, you may vote on whether you would prefer to hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers every 1 year, every 2 years or every 3 years.          This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a "say on frequency" vote and is required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act to be held at least once every six years beginning with the Company's 2013 annual stockholders meeting.          After the vote on this Proposal 3 at the Annual Meeting, the Company currently anticipates that the next say on frequency advisory vote will occur at its 2025 annual stockholders meeting.
The Company currently conducts a say on pay advisory vote every 1 year, which is consistent with the Board's recommendation and the say on         frequency vote held at the Company's 2013 annual stockholders meeting.  The Board of Directors continues to believe that a say on pay advisory vote should be conducted every 1 year.  An annual advisory vote on executive compensation will allow the         Company's stockholders to continue to provide input on the Company's compensation practices as disclosed in the proxy statement every year.  As a result, depending on the vote of its stockholders on this Proposal 3, the Company anticipates that it         will continue to hold a say on pay advisory vote on an annual basis, in which case the next such vote would be at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting").
You may cast your vote on your preferred say on pay voting frequency by choosing the option of 1 year, 2 years or 3 years, or you may abstain         from voting on this proposal.  In accordance with our Board's recommendation as described above, we ask that our stockholders vote for once every "1 YEAR" on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the option of 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years that receives the highest number of votes         cast on this resolution will be the advisory, non-binding frequency preferred by the stockholders of the Company for holding an advisory stockholder vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant         to the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules."
While the results of this advisory say on frequency vote are not binding, the Board of Directors will give careful consideration to the         choice that receives the most votes when determining the frequency of future say on pay votes.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR A "1 YEAR" FREQUENCY FOR FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE         COMPENSATION.
PROPOSAL 4: RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The firm of BDO USA, LLP served as independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31,         2018.  The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed the firm to continue in this capacity for the Company's 2019 fiscal year.  Accordingly, this Proposal 4 will be presented at the Annual Meeting to ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP as the         independent registered public accounting firm to audit the accounts and records of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and to perform other appropriate services as approved by the Audit Committee.  In the event that         stockholders fail to ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP, the Audit Committee may reconsider such selection.  Even if stockholders ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP, the Audit Committee may choose to appoint a different independent registered         public accounting firm at any time during the year if the committee determines that such a change would, in its judgment, be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
A representative of BDO USA, LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires         and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF BDO USA, LLP AS THE         COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.

The retainer agreements between the Company and the Auditor setting forth the terms and conditions of and estimated fees to be paid to the         Auditor for audit and tax return preparation services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee at the beginning of the respective engagements.  Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services         provided by the Auditor, except as may be permitted by applicable law.  These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services.  Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval         is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget.  The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chair when expedition of services is necessary. The Auditor and         management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the Auditor in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date.  None of the services         rendered by the Auditor in 2017 or 2018 were rendered pursuant to the de minimis exception established by the SEC, and all such services were         pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities         and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall such information be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933,         as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent the Company specifically requests that the information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporates it by reference into such a filing.
The Audit Committee of the Board serves as the representative of the Board of Directors for general oversight of the Company's accounting and         financial reporting processes, internal controls, audit process and process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations.

The members         of the Audit Committee are independent (as defined in Sections 803A and 803B(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide).  The Company's management has primary responsibility for preparing the Company's financial statements and the Company's financial         reporting process.  The Auditor is responsible for expressing an opinion on the fairness and conformity of the Company's audited financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  In this context, the         Audit Committee hereby reports as follows:
1. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with the Company's management.

As part of that review, the Auditor provided the Audit         Committee the written disclosures and letter required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning           Independence.

Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors:
Roy E. Hahn, Chair             Evan M. Wallach          David P. Wilson
INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Current Board of Directors
When considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, diversity of experience and         background, taken as a whole, to enable the Board of Directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of the Company's business and structure, the Board of Directors focused primarily on the information discussed in each of         the directors' individual biographies set forth below.
The following directors have terms expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting:
Mr. Roy E. Hahn, age 66.  Mr. Hahn is         the Chair of the Audit Committee and a member of the Compensation Committee and has served on the Board since 2007.  Mr. Hahn is currently Managing          Director of Marbridge Group, LLC, an alternative investment management firm he founded in 2004.  Prior to his founding of Marbridge Group, LLC, he was Managing Director of Chenery Associates, an investment management firm.  Mr. Hahn was a Director         at Coopers & Lybrand from 1987 to 1988, and a tax partner with that firm from 1989 to 2003.  Prior to Coopers & Lybrand, he was a partner at Arthur Young & Co.  His educational background includes a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting from San Francisco State University.  Mr. Hahn is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants           and the California Society of Certified Public Accountants.
The Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Hahn should serve as a director of the Company because of his knowledge of the Company's business         and history, his status as an "audit committee financial expert," and his overall expertise in accounting and finance principles and international finance transactions.
Ms. Toni M. Perazzo, age 72.  Ms.         Perazzo is a member of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors and has served on the Board since the Company's inception in 1997.  She is the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Senior Vice President-Finance, and Secretary.  She         is also President and Chief Financial Officer of JetFleet Management Corp. ("JMC"), a subsidiary of the Company, which prior to October 1, 2018 was the third-party management company for the Company, where she has been an officer in various         capacities since 1997. Her prior positions include Assistant Vice President for a savings and loan company, controller of an oil and gas syndicator and a senior auditor with Arthur Young & Co., Certified Public Accountants.

Ms. Perazzo is a certified public accountant and member of the California Society of         Certified Public Accountants and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
The Board of Directors concluded that Ms. Perazzo should serve as a director of the Company because of her knowledge of the Company's         business, history, capitalization structure and finances, her accounting and audit experience, as well as her many years of experience with JMC.
The following directors have terms expiring at the Company's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
Mr. David P. Wilson, age 64.  Mr.         Wilson has been a member of the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee since February 2015.  He also serves as Chair of the Compensation Committee.  Mr. Wilson is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Einn Volant Aircraft         Leasing LLC. Mr. Wilson retired in 2014 from General Electric Capital Aviation Services ("GECAS"), where he was most recently a Senior Vice President, concentrating on asset sales and aircraft securitizations to a worldwide investor base. Prior to         his 21-year career at GECAS, Mr. Wilson spent 8 years at Citicorp's Equipment Finance and Leasing Division as a product specialist in aircraft finance marketing and working on several airline bankruptcies and restructurings.  Prior to joining         Citicorp in 1985, he held various financial positions at De Lage Landen (formerly Master Lease Corp.) and Air Products and Chemicals at their headquarters.  Mr. Wilson started his career at Ernst & Ernst in 1977.  He received his Bachelor's         Degree in Accounting and Finance from Boston College in 1977 and a MS/MBA in Finance from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1983. 
The Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Wilson should serve as a director of the Company because of his knowledge of the aircraft leasing         and finance industry.
Mr. Michael G. Magnusson, age 61.          Since 2016, Mr. Magnusson has been the President and a director of the Company and the Managing Director of JMC.  Prior to joining the Company and JMC, he was a principal of SAL Solutions, an aircraft leasing consulting firm that he co-founded in         2015.  Before that he was with Saab Aircraft, which he joined in 1982 and where he held positions of increasing responsibility culminating in tenure as Chief Executive Officer of Saab Aircraft Leasing from 2001 until 2015.  Mr. Magnusson received a         Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1982 from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Board of Directors concluded that Mr. Magnusson should serve as a director of the Company because of his knowledge of the aircraft         leasing industry.
Board Meetings and Committees
The Board of Directors of the Company held five full board meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  During that year, no         incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees on which he or she served that were held during the period in which he or she was a director.
The Company has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and an Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, each of which is discussed         below.
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee         operates under a charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors, which is available on the Company's website at http://www.aerocentury.com/audit.php.  The         Audit Committee meets with the Company's financial management and its independent registered public accounting firm to review internal financial information, audit plans and results, and financial reporting procedures.  This committee currently         consists of Roy E. Hahn (Chair), Evan M. Wallach and David P. Wilson.  The Board has determined that Messrs. Hahn, Wallach, and Wilson are independent within the meaning of Sections 803A and 803B(2) of the NYSE American Company Guide.
The Board of Directors has determined that at least one member of the Audit Committee, Mr. Hahn, is an "audit committee financial expert"         within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.  In the course of his career, as described under "Current Board of Directors" above, Mr. Hahn acquired: (i) an understanding of generally accepted accounting principles         and financial statements, (ii) the ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves, (iii) experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial         statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company's financial statements, (iv) an         understanding of internal control over financial reporting, and (v) an understanding of audit committee functions.
The Audit Committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Compensation Committee.  Prior to the         JetFleet Acquisition, the Company received third-party management services from JMC, and therefore had no employees and did not pay any compensation to its executive officers.  Upon consummation of the Merger on October 1, 2018, JMC became a         subsidiary of the Company and therefore the Company now, through its JMC subsidiary, employs and compensates its officers and other employees.
The Board has established the Compensation Committee to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to compensation of the         Company's directors and officers and complying with disclosure requirements regarding such compensation, if and when required and in accordance with applicable SEC and stock exchange rules and regulations.  The Compensation Committee operates under         a charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors, which is available on the Company's website at http://www.aerocentury.com/compensation_committee.php.          The Compensation Committee currently consists of David P. Wilson (Chair), Roy E. Hahn, and Evan M. Wallach.  The Board has determined that Messrs. Wilson, Hahn, and Wallach are independent within the meaning of Sections 803A and 805(c) of the NYSE         American Company Guide.
To assist in fulfilling the duties under its charter, the Compensation Committee engaged McLagan, an Aon Company, in December 2017, to         perform a benchmarking study of the executive officer and director compensation practices of the Company's peers.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, McLagan was paid $31,875. McLagan has provided the Compensation Committee information regarding its independence as an advisor, including the fact that it has no other contract or business relationship with the Company, and the Compensation           Committee took that information into account in concluding that there was no conflict of interest within the meaning of Rule 10C‑1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 affecting McLagan's independence.
In 2018, using benchmarking information received from McLagan  including compensation data from a sampling of equipment and         aircraft leasing companies, the Compensation Committee reviewed the director compensation paid by the Company, and based on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, director fees were revised in August 2018, effective October 1, 2018, the         date of the JetFleet Acquisition.
In anticipation of the acquisition of JMC, during 2018, the Compensation Committee began reviewing various sources of data         when determining executive compensation levels, including compensation data from a sampling of public companies and public compensation surveys, and other information collected by McLagan on prevailing compensation practices of comparable companies         with whom the Company competes for executive talent.
The Compensation Committee will be using such benchmarks in conjunction with the Company's financial and other business         performance in order to set the named executive officers' salaries for 2019 and beyond.  In addition, the Compensation Committee will be reviewing whether and when to adopt additional compensation incentive programs for the named executive officers         and certain specified key employees, including  annual incentive compensation in the form of cash bonuses, or other  long‑term incentive compensation in the form of a restricted stock grant program,  employee stock purchase plan, and other employee         benefit plans and programs.
In determining the level of salary and incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee will not seek to mechanically tie         compensation levels to a formula based upon the chosen sample of companies reviewed or employ any other formulaic process in making compensation decisions. Rather, the Compensation Committee intends to use its subjective judgment based upon a         review of all information, including an annual review for each officer of his or her level of responsibility, contributions to the Company's financial results, adherence to the Company's business plan,  and the Company's overall performance. The         Compensation Committee makes a generalized assessment of these factors and this information is not weighted in any specific manner.
Going forward, the Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of non-employee directors, will exclusively determine         annual compensation for the Board of Directors and named executive officers, as well incentive targets and long‑term incentive compensation for the named executive officers and other employees, and, when and if other incentive or other bonus plans         are adopted, any bonus or other benefits granted to the named executive officers.  
The Compensation Committee held six meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Executive Committee.  The Executive         Committee has the authority to acquire, dispose of and finance investments for the Company and execute contracts and agreements, including those related to the borrowing of money by the Company, and generally exercises all other powers of the Board         of Directors except for those which require action by all of the directors or the independent directors under the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company, or under applicable law or stock exchange requirements.  The Executive         Committee currently consists of only two directors, Toni M. Perazzo and Evan M. Wallach, and did not hold any meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Director Nominations.  The Company         does not have a formal nominating committee.  The independent directors separately consider and make recommendations to the full Board of Directors regarding any candidate being considered to serve on the Board of Directors, and the full Board of         Directors reviews and makes a determination regarding such potential candidates.  In light of this practice, which is similar to the practices of many boards of directors that have a standing nominating committee, the Board believes it is         unnecessary to formally establish such a committee.
The Board has not adopted a formal procedure for considering nominees recommended by stockholders, other than the procedures described herein         that are applicable to all director candidates and the procedures set forth in the Bylaws of the Company for stockholder nominations of directors.  While the Board of Directors does not have a specific policy for considering nominees recommended by         stockholders, this does not mean that a recommendation would not be considered if received from a stockholder.  The Board believes that the current informal consideration process is adequate in light of the historical absence of stockholder         recommendations of director nominees.  In any event, the Board expects there would be no difference between the manner in which the Board of Directors would evaluate a director candidate recommended by a stockholder and a director candidate         recommended by any other source, such as an existing member of the Board of Directors or one of the Company's executive officers.
Although the Board of Directors does not have a formal policy with respect to Board diversity, it strives to constitute the Board with         directors who bring to our Company a variety of perspectives, cultural sensitivity, life experiences, skills, expertise, and sound business understanding and judgment derived from a broad range of business, professional, governmental, community         involvement, personal and aircraft leasing and finance experiences, as well as directors who have skills and experience that are relevant and helpful to the Company's industry and operations and who have the desire and capacity to actively serve.          In addition, the Board is aware of the recently enacted California law requiring publicly held corporations whose principal executive offices are located in California to have at least one female director on their boards by the end of the 2019         calendar year and at least one to three female directors, depending on the size of the board, by the end of the 2021 calendar year.  Because our principal executive offices are located in California, we are subject to these requirements.  If the         existing composition of the Board does not change before the end of 2019, the Company will be in compliance with this law at such time.
In reviewing a potential candidate for the Board, the Board of Directors considers the individual's experience in the Company's industry, the         general business or other experience of the candidate, the needs of the Company for an additional or replacement director, the personality of the candidate, and the candidate's interest in the business of the Company, as well as numerous other         subjective criteria.  Of greatest importance is an individual's integrity, willingness to actively participate and ability to bring to the Company his or her experience and knowledge in areas that are most beneficial to the Board.  In addition, the         Board recognizes that at least a majority of the Company's directors must be independent under applicable NYSE American rules, the members of certain Board committees must satisfy enhanced independence and financial expertise standards under         applicable NYSE American and SEC rules, and one member of the Board should meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules.
Except as described above, there are no specific minimum qualifications that the Board believes must be met by a director nominee.  The Board         intends to continue to evaluate candidates for election to the Board on the basis of the foregoing criteria.
Board Leadership Structure
The Board believes its current leadership structure best serves the objectives of the Board's oversight of management, the Board's ability to         carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of the stockholders, and the Company's overall governance.  The Board believes that Evan M. Wallach is best situated to serve as Chair of the Board because he is familiar with the Company's         business and industry and most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities for the Company, leading the Board in discussions regarding the Company's business and industry, and focusing the Board on execution of strategy.  As an         independent director, Mr. Wallach brings a different perspective than the Company's management on the strategy development for the Company, drawing upon not only his deep knowledge of the Company but also his experience, oversight and expertise         from outside the Company and its industry.  The Board believes that having a non-executive Chair provides a check and balance on the power of management and therefore enhances the Board's oversight of Company risks, strategies and policy making.
Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight
The Company is exposed to a number of operational and financial risks, and the Board plays an active role in overseeing management of these         risks.  The Company's President (who is a member of the Board of Directors) is directly responsible for a number of operational risks, such as the risks inherent in acquiring, owning, leasing and disposing of used aircraft and engines.  The Board         regularly receives reports from the President on these risks and works closely with the Company's management on strategies to manage these risks and to develop contingency plans.  The Company's Chief Financial Officer (who is a member of the Board         of Directors) is directly responsible for a number of financial risks, such as the risks associated with the Company's credit and liquidity.  The Audit Committee and the full Board regularly receive reports from the Chief Financial Officer on these         risks and work closely with the Company's management on strategies to manage these risks and to develop contingency plans.  The Board also meets and confers regularly with the Company's management to identify other risks faced by the Company, and         the General Counsel of the Company and outside counsel attend all board meetings as non-voting guests of the Board.  The Company believes that this and other interactions with senior management of the Company provide the Board with visibility into         and access to the details underlying the risks the Company faces, and thereby enhances the quality of the Board's risk oversight.  Among the risks over which the Board exercises oversight are economic, financial, industrial, legal, and operational         risks, including cybersecurity risks.
In addition, the Board performs its risk oversight function in part through its committees, which, except for the Executive Committee, are         comprised solely of independent directors.  The Audit Committee oversees management of risks related to financial reporting and disclosure processes and accounting policies, as well as certain specific financial risks, such as variable interest         rate risk, and risks related to related party or conflict-of-interest transactions.  The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks related to compensation policies and practices.  The Company believes the role of these Board committees in         the Board's performance of its risk oversight function, as well as the Board's leadership structure discussed above, which separates the roles of Chair of the Board and President, provide an appropriate level of independent oversight, including         risk oversight, of the Company's management team.
Communication between Stockholders and Directors
The Company's Board of Directors currently does not have a formal process for stockholders to send communications to the Board of Directors         and does not believe such procedures are necessary at this time because it believes that informal communications are sufficient to communicate questions, comments and observations that could be useful to the Board.  Stockholders wishing to         communicate to the Board informally can address written correspondence to the Company's Board of Directors, at the Company's address at 1440 Chapin Avenue, Suite 310, Burlingame, California 94010, Att'n:  Board of Directors.
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting
It is the policy of the Company and Board of Directors that directors attend the Annual Meeting and be available for questions from         stockholders.  All the then-seated directors, including the directors nominated for election, attended the Company's 2018 Annual Stockholders' Meeting.  It is anticipated that the director nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting will also         attend the 2019 meeting.
Board Independence
If the nominee to the Board of Directors is elected, a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company, consisting of Messrs. Hahn,         Wallach, and Wilson, will be independent directors, as defined in Section 803A of the NYSE American Company Guide.
Involvement in Legal Proceedings
No director, officer or affiliate of the Company, beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Common Stock, or associate of any of the foregoing         is involved in a material proceeding as a party adverse to the Company or with a material interest adverse to the Company.
Family Relationships
There are no family relationships among the Company's directors or executive officers.
Director Compensation
Non-employee board members will receive an annual fee of $64,000 in 2019, paid in quarterly installments, and are also reimbursed for all         reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors.  Non-employee members of Board committees will also receive $3,000 annually for each committee membership, the Audit Committee Chair         and Compensation Committee Chair each will receive an additional $5,500 annually, and the Chair of the Board will receive an additional $35,000 annually.  An officer of the Company who serves as a Board member does not receive any compensation for         Board or committee service.  No member of the Company's Board of Directors receives equity compensation for his or her service as a member of the Company's Board of Directors or any of its committees.
The table below provides the           compensation of the Company's non-employee directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  The compensation of the Company's directors who also serve as           executive officers of the Company is set forth under "Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table" below.

(3) Consists of a matching contribution under employees 401(k) plan and life insurance premiums paid by the Company for employee.
Named Executive Officer Employment           Agreements.
Michael G. Magnusson.          Mr. Magnusson has an employment contract with JetFleet Management Corp. ("JMC"), which expires on August 31, 2019, but which is automatically renewable for consecutive one year periods, unless and until either party gives ninety days notice of         non-renewal.  The agreement provides for a Base Salary of $350,000, with a fixed bonus of $50,000 if the pre-bonus profit of JetFleet Management Corp. exceeds $750,000, and additional discretionary bonus amounts. It provides that semi-monthly         compensation will continue until the scheduled expiration date of the contracted period  if Mr. Magnusson terminates his employment after one of the following events: (1) there is a material and adverse change in his position, duties,         responsibilities, or status with JMC; (2) a reduction in his salary or benefits then in effect, other than a reduction comparable to reductions generally applicable to similarly situated employees of JMC; (3) JMC materially breaches this Agreement;         or (4) there is a change of control of JMC, other than as a result of a transaction with the Company.  Upon the Company's acquisition of JetFleet Holding Corp. ("JetFleet"), the parent of JMC, Mr. Magnusson's salary and bonus compensation became         subject to review and approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is currently negotiating a more appropriate employment agreement with the Company to reflect the post-merger structure of JMC and the Company.
Toni M. Perazzo.          Ms. Perazzo does not have a formal employment agreement with the Company and serves in her positions in on an "at-will" basis at the discretion and direction of the Board.
Compensation Before Acquisition of JetFleet.           Upon consummation of the JetFleet Acquisition on October 1, 2018, the Company became responsible for the compensation paid by JMC to JMC's employees.  Prior to the Merger, Toni M. Perazzo, in her capacity as President of JMC, had sole discretion in         determining annual salary and cash bonus amounts for JMC's employees (other than Mr. Magnusson, who had an employment contract with JMC containing contractual provisions relating to minimum salary and bonus calculation as discussed above),         including Ms. Perazzo's own salary and bonus amounts.  Following the Merger, the compensation of the Company's executive officers and the bonus and incentive programs applicable to the Company's employees are being determined by the Compensation         Committee.
In addition, prior to the Merger, Ms. Perazzo           owned or controlled approximately 56% of the outstanding shares of stock of JetFleet, and thus had an indirect ownership interest in JMC of approximately 56%. The Company paid management fees, acquisition fees and remarketing expense           reimbursements to JMC of $7,010,800 and $4,977,200 in 2017 and 2018 through the date of the Merger, respectively.  Because of her indirect ownership interest in JMC, Ms. Perazzo had an indirect interest in approximately 56% of these management           fees, acquisition fees, and remarketing expense reimbursements, or $3,926,048 and $1,937,432 in 2017 and 2018 through the date of the Merger, respectively. To the extent that the management fees, acquisition fees, and remarketing expense reimbursements paid by the Company to JMC were in excess of JMC's expenses in managing the Company's portfolio in each such year, such payments enhanced           the value of JMC's equity, and in turn the value of JetFleet's equity, to the JetFleet shareholders.
JetFleet declared no dividends in 2017. In 2018, before the date of the Merger, JetFleet declared an in-kind stock dividend         equal to 0.357 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock per share of JetFleet common stock and a cash dividend equal to $10.96 per share of JetFleet common stock.  As a result of such dividends, Ms. Perazzo became beneficial owner of 114,436 shares of         AeroCentury Common Stock and $2,114,129 in cash.
Upon completion of the Merger, Ms. Perazzo's equity ownership in JetFleet, along with the equity ownership of all JetFleet         shareholders, was acquired for the merger consideration at a per share exchange rate of 0.357 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock and $7.83 for each share of JetFleet common stock.  Thus, upon consummation of the Merger, Ms. Perazzo became         beneficial owner of 68,850 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock and $1,536,651 in exchange for her JetFleet shares.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Acquisition of JetFleet by the Company
On October 1, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), by         and among the Company, JetFleet and Falcon Landing, Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub") and certain other parties, the Company acquired JetFleet (together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, JMC)         by way of merger ("Merger") of JetFleet with Merger Sub, with JetFleet surviving the Merger.  The Merger was consummated following the approval and adoption of the Merger and the Merger Agreement by both the JetFleet and AeroCentury stockholders.
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of JetFleet common stock issued and outstanding immediately before the         Merger was cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 0.357 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock and (ii) $7.83 in cash.  As a result, AeroCentury issued 129,217 shares of its common stock and paid approximately $2.84 million in cash to         the former JetFleet stockholders at the closing of the Merger.
Prior to the Merger, JetFleet beneficially owned 214,876 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock, or approximately 15.2% of the then-outstanding         shares.
Until its acquisition by the Company in 2018, JMC,            the wholly-owned subsidiary of JetFleet, acted as a third-party management company for the Company under the Second Amended and Restated Management Agreement, dated August 17, 2015, between JMC and the Company (the "Management Agreement"), and           received management fees, acquisition fees and remarketing expense reimbursements from the Company pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement totaling $7,010,800 and $3,459,700  in 2017 and 2018 through the date of the Merger,           respectively.
Prior to the Merger, the officers of the Company were also officers of JMC and the sole member of JMC's Board of Directors, Toni M. Perazzo, was on the Board of Directors of the           Company.  Ms. Perazzo owned or controlled approximately 56% of the outstanding shares of stock of JetFleet, and thus had an indirect ownership interest in JMC of approximately 56%.  As a result of her indirect ownership interest in JMC,         until the closing of the Merger on October 1, 2018, Ms. Perazzo had an indirect interest in approximately 56% of the management fees, acquisition fees and remarketing expense reimbursements paid by the Company to JMC, or $3,926,048 and $1,937,432 in 2017 and 2018 through the date of the Merger, respectively.  To the extent that the management fees, acquisition fees, and remarketing expense reimbursements paid by the Company to JMC were in excess of JMC's expenses in managing the Company's portfolio in each such year, such payments           enhanced the value of JMC's equity, and in turn the value of JetFleet's equity, to the JetFleet shareholders.
Immediately prior to consummation of the Merger, Ms. Perazzo, as a shareholder of JetFleet, received from JetFleet a dividend of 114,436         shares of AeroCentury Common Stock and $2,114,129 in cash with respect to her shares of JetFleet.  Upon consummation of the Merger, in exchange for her shares in JetFleet, Ms. Perazzo received 68,850 shares of AeroCentury Common Stock and $1,536,651 in cash from the Company as a result of the Merger.
Before completion of the JHC Acquisition, in April 2018, the Company, JetFleet  and JMC entered into a waiver and reimbursement agreement         (the "Waiver/Reimbursement Agreement"), pursuant to which JHC and JMC agreed to waive their right to receive management and acquisition fees ("Contract Fees") otherwise owed by the Company to JMC pursuant to the Management Agreement for all periods         after March 31, 2018 and until consummation of the Merger, and in return, the Company agreed to reimburse JMC for expenses ("Management Expense") incurred in providing management services set forth under the Management Agreement.  During such         period, Contract Fees totaled $3,531,000 and Management Expense totaled $2,013,000.
Office Space
The Company maintains its principal office at 1440 Chapin Avenue, Suite 310, Burlingame, California 94010.
Engine-for-Common Stock Exchange
In March 2017, the Company exchanged one of its engines for 150,000 shares of its Common Stock held by a holder of more than 5% of the         then-outstanding Common Stock.  Following such exchange, such shares of Common Stock were retired and cancelled.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and officers and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered         class of the Company's equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company.  Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial         owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other         reports were required, the Company believes the Company's officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS
It is the policy of the Company to conduct its affairs in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in         which it does business.  As part of this policy, the Company maintains a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is available on the Company's website at http://www.aerocentury.com/code-of-conduct.php.
