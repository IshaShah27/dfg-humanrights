PROXY STATEMENT 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on May 2, 2019 and at any adjournments thereof. 
Who Can Vote 
Each holder of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 5, 2019 is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 5, 2019, there were 245,932,905 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
Distribution of Proxy Solicitation and Other Required Annual Meeting Materials 
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted rules that allow us to mail a notice to our stockholders advising that our proxy statement, annual report to stockholders, electronic proxy card, and related materials are available for viewing, free of charge, on the Internet. These rules give us the opportunity to serve you more efficiently by making the proxy materials available quickly online and reducing costs associated with printing and postage. Stockholders may access these materials and vote over the Internet or by telephone or request delivery of a full set of materials by mail or email. We have elected to utilize this process for the Annual Meeting. We began mailing the required notice, called a Notice Regarding Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice"), to stockholders on or about March 22, 2019. The proxy materials have been posted on the Internet, at https://materials.proxyvote.com/171340. If you received a Notice by mail, you will not receive a paper or email copy of the proxy materials unless you request one in the manner set forth in the Notice. 
How You Can Vote 
You may vote by any of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person.    Stockholders of record and beneficial stockholders with shares held in street name  (held in the name of a broker or other nominee) may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you hold shares in street name, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By telephone or via the Internet.    You may vote by proxy, either by telephone or via  the Internet, by following the instructions provided in the Notice, proxy card, or voting instruction card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail.    If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy  by signing and returning the proxy card or voting instruction card.  
[END TABLE]
If you vote by telephone or via the Internet, please have your Notice or proxy card available. The control number appearing on your Notice or proxy card is necessary to process your vote. A telephone or Internet vote authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you marked, signed, and returned a proxy card by mail. 
How You May Revoke or Change Your Vote 
You have the power to change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of record.    You may change or revoke your vote by submitting a written  notice of change or revocation to our Secretary at the address listed above or by submitting another timely vote (including a vote via the Internet or by telephone). For all methods of voting, the last vote cast will supersede all previous votes.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Beneficial owners.    You may change or revoke your voting instructions by following the  specific directions provided to you by your bank or broker.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Savings and Profit Sharing Plan participants.    You may change or revoke your voting  instructions by April 29, 2019, by either revising your instructions via the Internet, by telephone, or by submitting to the trustee of the Savings and Profit Sharing Plan either a written notice of revocation or a properly completed and signed  proxy card bearing a later date.  
[END TABLE]
Required Vote 
You are entitled to cast one vote for each share of common stock you own on March 5, 2019, the record date. The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the proposal and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. 
Our by-laws provide for majority voting in uncontested director elections. As a result, at the Annual Meeting, directors will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) in an uncontested election. For this purpose, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are not counted as votes for or against a nominee. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to director nominees, your shares will be counted for purposes of a quorum, but will have no effect on the election of the nominees. All of our director nominees are currently serving on our Board of Directors. If a nominee who is currently serving as a director is not re-elected, Delaware law provides that the director would continue to serve on our Board of Directors as a "holdover director." Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines ("Corporate Governance Guidelines"), each incumbent director nominee submits, prior to the Annual Meeting, a contingent resignation that our Board of Directors may accept if stockholders do not re-elect the director. If a director is not re-elected by our stockholders, the Governance & Nominating Committee would make a recommendation to our Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation of that director, or whether to take other action. Our Board of Directors would act on the resignation, taking into account the Governance & Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. 
Any other matters that may be acted upon at the Annual Meeting will be determined by the affirmative vote of the majority of votes represented at the meeting (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote on the matter. An abstention will have the same effect as a vote against with respect to the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers and the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of our directors or the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, and a broker "non-vote" is not counted for purposes of voting on these matters. 
How Shares Will be Voted 
Stockholders of record.    If you are a stockholder of record and you: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• indicate when voting via the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by our Board of Directors, or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions,  
[END TABLE]
then the proxy holders will vote your shares FOR the election of the nominees described in this proxy statement, FOR the compensation of our named executive officers, and FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Beneficial owners.    If you hold shares in street name (in the name of a broker or other nominee), you must give instructions to your bank or broker on how you would like your shares to be voted. Under applicable New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, your bank or broker has discretion to vote on "routine" matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm, but does not have discretion to vote on "non-routine" matters, such as the election of directors or the proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Thus, if a bank or broker holds your shares and you do not instruct the bank or broker how to vote on the election of directors or on the proposal related to the advisory vote on compensation of our named executive officers, no votes will be cast on your behalf. 
Savings and Profit Sharing Plan participants.    If you participate in the Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Salaried Employees or the Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Hourly Employees (the "Plans"), you may have voting rights regarding shares of our common stock credited to your account in the Plans. In order to permit the trustee to tally and vote the shares held in the Plans ("Plan Shares"), your instructions, whether by Internet, by telephone, or by proxy card, must be submitted on or prior to April 29, 2019. If you do not instruct the trustee how to vote, your Plan Shares will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion that it votes Plan Shares for those accounts in the Plans for which it did receive timely voting instructions. The proportional voting policy is detailed under the terms of the Plans and the associated trust agreements. 
Other matters.    Our Board of Directors is not aware of any matters that will be brought before the Annual Meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named on the enclosed proxy card will vote in their discretion on such matters. 
Who can attend the Annual Meeting 
Only stockholders as of the record date, March 5, 2019, or duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting. No guests will be allowed to attend the Annual Meeting. 
What do I need to attend the Annual Meeting and when should I arrive 
The Annual Meeting will be held at Church & Dwight's Headquarters, 500 Charles Ewing Boulevard, Ewing, New Jersey 08628. Admission to the Annual Meeting will begin at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time. 
In order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you should: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• arrive shortly after 11:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, to ensure that you are seated by the commencement of the Annual  Meeting at 12:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be prepared to comply with security requirements, which may include security guards searching all bags, among other  security measures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• leave your camera at home because cameras, transmission, broadcasting, and other recording devices will not be permitted in  the meeting room (and we will ask that smart phones be turned off during the meeting); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• bring photo identification, such as a driver's license, and proof of ownership of our common stock on the record date,  March 5, 2019. If you are a holder of record, the top half of your proxy card or your Notice of Availability is your admission ticket. If you hold your shares in street name, a recent brokerage statement or a letter from your bank, broker,  trustee, or other nominee are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote your shares held in street name in person, you must get a legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee that holds your shares of common  stock.  
[END TABLE]
Any holder of a proxy from a stockholder must present a properly executed legal proxy and a copy of the proof of ownership. 
If you do not provide photo identification and comply with the other procedures outlined above for attending the Annual Meeting in person, you will not be admitted to the Annual Meeting. 
Costs of Solicitation 
Solicitation of proxies on our behalf may be made by our directors or employees by mail, in person, and by telephone. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. ("D.F. King") to aid in the solicitation of proxies for a fee estimated not to exceed $7,500 plus out-of-pocket expenses. We will pay all costs of the solicitation, and will indemnify D.F. King against liabilities relating to or arising from their proxy solicitation services conducted on our behalf, other than those resulting from D.F. King's willful misconduct or gross negligence. We also will reimburse banks, brokerage houses, and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for forwarding Notices and proxy materials to beneficial owners. 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Certificate of Incorporation has historically provided for the division of our Board of Directors into three classes, with the directors in each class serving for a term of three years. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved, and the Company adopted, an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the phased-in transition to the annual election of our Board of Directors. This year, three directors will stand for election for one-year terms on our Board of Directors. In 2020, six directors will stand for election for one-year terms and in 2021 all directors will stand for election for one-year terms. Our Board of Directors currently consists of ten members. The current terms of three of our directors not up for election at this year's Annual Meeting expire in 2020, and the current terms of four of our directors not up for election at this year's Annual Meeting expire in 2021. 
At the Annual Meeting, three directors will be elected to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting, in each case, until their successors are elected and qualified. Our Board of Directors has nominated Bradley C. Irwin, Penry W. Price, and Arthur B. Winkleblack, all of whom currently serve as members of our Board of Directors. All nominees have agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. 
SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors, with support and recommendations from the Governance & Nominating Committee, oversees the composition and succession of its members. To this end, at least once a year, in connection with its annual evaluation of our Board of Directors, its committees, and individual directors, the Governance & Nominating Committee evaluates each director nominee's performance, relative strengths against a set of criteria, including those set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and future plans, including any retirement objectives. As part of that evaluation, our Governance & Nominating Committee identifies areas of overall strength and weakness with respect to the Board's and its committees' composition. 
Our directors, including our director nominees, possess relevant experience, skills and qualifications that contribute to a well-functioning board. The skills and characteristics that the Governance & Nominating Committee and the Board seek in the composition of the Board, and which the Board uses in succession planning and the director nomination processes, as well as the individual experiences, skills and characteristics of our Board members are highlighted in the following matrix: 
The matrix provided above is intended as a summary and is not an exhaustive list of each nominee's contributions to the Board. The ratings provided are self-assessed ratings that are reviewed by the Governance & Nominating Committee. Further biographical information about our directors, including our director nominees, is set forth below. 
The Governance & Nominating Committee and our Board of Directors believe that the nominees listed below and the directors continuing in office collectively possess these attributes, which, together with their respective experience described in the biographical summaries below, make each nominee or director, as applicable, well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors. 
We do not anticipate that any of the nominees will become unavailable to serve as a director for any reason. However, if any of them becomes unavailable, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote for any substitute nominee designated by our Board of Directors, unless our Board of Directors determines to reduce the number of directors in the relevant class. 
Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR all of the following nominees. 
Information concerning the nominees and continuing members of our Board of Directors is provided below:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND OTHER BOARD MATTERS 
BOARD COMPOSITION 
Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of James R. Craigie, Matthew T. Farrell, Bradley C. Irwin, Robert D. LeBlanc, Penry W. Price, Ravichandra K. Saligram, Robert K. Shearer, Janet S. Vergis, Arthur B. Winkleblack, and Laurie J. Yoler. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, including guidelines for the determination of director independence, the responsibilities and duties of our Board of Directors, director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, the committees of our Board of Directors, and other matters relating to our corporate governance, are available on the "Investors" page of our website, www.churchdwight.com. Also available on the "Investors" page are other corporate governance documents, including our Code of Conduct ("Code of Conduct") and the Charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation & Organization Committee, and Governance & Nominating Committee. 
Our website is not part of this proxy statement; references to our website address in this proxy statement are intended to be inactive textual references only. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENCE 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a majority of our Board of Directors shall consist of independent directors who meet the criteria for independence required by the NYSE listing standards. A director will be considered independent if our Board of Directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with us (directly, or as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us). In assessing the materiality of a relationship, our Board of Directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances. In addition to the independence standards established by the NYSE, we have adopted categorical standards under the Corporate Governance Guidelines designed to assist our Board of Directors in assessing independence. Under these standards, none of the following relationships necessarily disqualifies a director or nominee from being considered "independent": 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director's or a director's immediate family member's ownership of five percent or less of the equity of an  organization that has a relationship with us,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director's service as an executive officer of or employment by, or a director's immediate family member's  service as an executive officer of, a company that makes payments to or receives payments from us for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, is less than the greater of $1 million or two percent of such  other company's consolidated gross revenues, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director's service as an executive officer of a charitable organization that received annual contributions from the  Company that have not exceeded the greater of $1 million or two percent of such charitable organization's annual gross revenues in any of such charitable organization's last three fiscal years.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors reviewed and analyzed the independence of each director and each nominee for director in January 2019 to determine whether any particular relationship or transaction involving any director, or any director's affiliates or immediate family members, was inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent for purposes of serving on our Board of Directors and its committees. During this review, our Board examined transactions and relationships between directors or their affiliates and family members and Church & Dwight. As a result of this review, in January 2019, our Board affirmatively determined that each of James R. Craigie, Bradley C. Irwin, Robert D. LeBlanc, Penry W. Price, Ravichandra K. Saligram, Robert K. Shearer, Janet S. Vergis, Arthur B. Winkleblack, and Laurie J. Yoler, is independent within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards and under the categorical standards described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Until January of 2019, our Board had determined that Mr. Craigie was not "independent," under the NYSE listing standards given his prior role as our Chief Executive Officer, which ended upon his retirement in January 2016. Our Board has also affirmatively determined that T. Rosie Albright, who retired from the Board of Directors during 2018, was independent during the time she served on the Board of Directors. 
Our Board of Directors has further determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation & Organization Committee, and Governance & Nominating Committee is independent within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards, and that the members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation & Organization Committee meet the additional independence requirements of the NYSE listing standards applicable to audit committee members and compensation committee members, respectively. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
None of the directors who served on the Compensation & Organization Committee in fiscal year 2018 has ever served as one of our officers or employees. In addition, none of the directors who served on the Compensation & Organization Committee had any relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries during fiscal year 2018 pursuant to which disclosure would be required under applicable rules and regulations of the SEC pertaining to the disclosure of transactions with related persons. During fiscal year 2018, none of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee (or other committee performing similar functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors), of any other entity of which an executive officer of such other entity served on our Board of Directors or the Compensation & Organization Committee. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors meets in regularly scheduled executive sessions without any members of our management, including the CEO, present. The Lead Director, currently Mr. LeBlanc, is responsible for chairing the executive sessions of our Board of Directors. In addition, each of the Compensation & Organization, Governance & Nominating and Audit Committees regularly meet alone in scheduled executive sessions without any members of our management, including the CEO, present. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our Board of Directors, acting principally through the Audit Committee, is actively involved in the oversight of the significant risks affecting our business. Our Board of Directors' and the Audit Committee's risk oversight activities are focused on management's risk assessment and management processes, as well as on our ethics and compliance program. 
Our Internal Audit department administers a vigorous risk assessment effort every other year, in collaboration with all of our directors and executive officers. This process is designed to identify and rank the most significant risks that affect our Company, including consideration of a large number of risks associated with companies in the consumer products industry. The assessed risks encompass, among others, economic, industry, enterprise, operational, cybersecurity, compliance, sustainability and financial risks. Our President and Chief Executive Officer assigns an executive officer to lead the management of each of those risks identified as among the most significant. As part of the risk management process, our Internal Audit department annually prepares an Internal Audit project plan under which it reviews activities directed to mitigate business and financial related risks. This plan is subject to Audit Committee approval. 
Our Director, Internal Audit ("Internal Audit Director") meets quarterly with our executive officers to assess any changes in the magnitude of identified risks, as well as the status of mitigation activities with regard to the most significant risks. Our Internal Audit Director reports directly to the Audit Committee and advises the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis regarding management's risk assessment process and the progress of mitigation activities designed to facilitate the maintenance of risk within acceptable levels. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports to our Board of Directors with regard to these matters on a quarterly basis. Our Board of Directors also receives quarterly updates on cybersecurity risks from our Vice President, Global IT. 
Our Executive Vice President and General Counsel leads our ethics and compliance risk oversight program through the Compliance Council, which is comprised of various functional representatives and compliance subject matter experts. The Compliance Council meets regularly to review the health of the program, opportunities for improvement, and the status of execution against agreed program priorities. Our Executive Vice President and General Counsel also meets regularly with the Audit Committee, either alone or together with subject matter experts from the Compliance Council, to review the health of our compliance and ethics program, its priorities, and the status of execution against those priorities. Annually, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel provides a comprehensive review of the compliance and ethics program to our Board of Directors, and supplements this review, from time to time, as requested by our Board of Directors or as appropriate with respect to specific compliance risk areas or issues. 
Our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Executive Vice Presidents of Global Research & Development, Global Operations and Global Human Resources lead our sustainability program through the Corporate Issues Council, which is comprised of various functional representatives and subject matter experts. The Corporate Issues Council meets regularly to review the health of the program, opportunities for improvement, and the status of execution against agreed program priorities. Our Executive Vice President and General Counsel also meets regularly with the Governance & Nominating Committee, together with subject matter experts from the Corporate Issues Council, to review the health of our sustainability program, its priorities, and the status of execution against those priorities. The Chair of our Governance & Nominating Committee reviews the status of our sustainability program with our Board of Directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting, and supplements this review, from time to time, as requested by our Board of Directors or as appropriate with respect to specific sustainability matters. 
In addition to the efforts of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee to address risk oversight, the Compensation & Organization Committee annually reviews our compensation policies and practices to confirm that such compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. As a result of its most recent review in 2018, the Compensation & Organization Committee concluded that our incentive compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The four 2018 performance metrics selected under our Annual Incentive Plan were counterbalanced so that, for example, an  undue focus on net sales at the expense of gross margins would not result in a higher payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards are earned based on achievement of corporate performance objectives under the Annual Incentive Plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We cap maximum awards under the Annual Incentive Plan so they cannot exceed 250 percent of the plan target award, which  limits the potential for excessive emphasis on short-term incentives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options constitute a substantial portion of an executive's total remuneration and vest as to all underlying  shares on the third anniversary of the date of grant, which encourages a longer-term focus.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual stock option grants result in overlapping three-year vesting periods, which reduces the risk of an inappropriate  focus on one vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our stock ownership guidelines require that our executives hold a significant amount of our stock to further align their  interests to the interests of our stockholders on a long-term basis.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors believes that our compensation system, our division of risk oversight responsibilities, and our Board of Directors' leadership structure comprise and support the most effective risk management approach. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our Board of Directors may determine from time to time what leadership structure works best for our Company, including whether the same individual should serve both as Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In addition, the guidelines provide that if the same individual serves as Chairman of our Board of Directors and CEO, or the Chairman is otherwise not independent, our Board of Directors shall have an independent Lead Director, as selected by the independent members of the Board. 
Since January 2016, when Mr. Farrell was elected as President and CEO and Mr. Craigie retired as our CEO but continued as non-executive Chairman, the Board has split the Chairman and CEO roles. The Board determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company to split the roles of Chairman and CEO upon Mr. Craigie's retirement as CEO, to provide for continuity of Board leadership and strategic oversight by retaining Mr. Craigie, who served as President and CEO from 2004 to 2007 and as Chairman and CEO from 2007 to 2016. This allows Mr. Farrell to focus on business matters in his role as President and CEO. As CEO, Mr. Farrell reports to the Board and, as a director, attends all Board meetings. 
Although our Board of Directors has determined that our Chairman Mr. Craigie is independent under the rules of the NYSE and our Corporate Governance Guidelines as of January 2019, the Board of Directors has determined to maintain the role of Lead Director, which is currently held by Mr. LeBlanc. The Board determined that maintaining the role of Lead Director would continue to facilitate Board leadership and oversight, particularly given Mr. Craigie's past role as our CEO until his retirement in January 2016. Mr. LeBlanc has served on our Board of Directors since 1998 and as Lead Director since 2010. The Lead Director presides over executive sessions and has the authority to call executive sessions. The Lead Director also consults with the entire Board of Directors and with our President and CEO and our Secretary on Board of Directors meeting agendas. In addition, the Lead Director acts as a contact person to facilitate communications between employees, stockholders, and others with the independent directors. 
We believe that the presence of a Lead Director enhances the ability of our Board of Directors to provide additional independent oversight and supplements the following corporate governance practices, which also facilitate independent oversight: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of our directors, other than our President and CEO, are independent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation & Organization Committee, and Governance &  Nominating Committee are independent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board of Directors and each of its standing committees meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without the  presence of management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board of Directors completes an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the full Board of Directors, each of its  standing committees, and individual directors.  
[END TABLE]
COMMUNICATION WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
While management has primary responsibility for stockholder engagement, our Board of Directors is regularly informed about management's stockholder engagement efforts as part of its oversight role and is committed to enhancing stockholder value and to considering requests from our stockholders that will help us achieve this goal. Our stockholder engagement practices and controls, which are designed to support our commitment to constructive communications between our stockholders and the independent directors, include the ability of our stockholders to attend the Annual Meeting, an annual advisory vote on executive compensation ("say-on-pay"), the ability to submit stockholder proposals and recommend candidates for election to our Board, and the ability to communicate directly with our Board of Directors. 
Our Lead Director acts as a contact person to facilitate communications between employees, stockholders and others with the independent directors. The Lead Director, who is currently also Chair of the Governance & Nominating Committee, is responsible for ensuring that stockholder requests, recommendations, and proposals regarding governance-related matters are evaluated by that Committee, the Compensation & Organization Committee, or Audit Committee, as appropriate, and then by our Board of Directors based on the applicable Committee's recommendation. 
Any person who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors, including the Lead Director or the independent directors as a group, may direct a written communication to our Board of Directors, the Lead Director, or the independent directors, at: Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Princeton South Corporate Park, 500 Charles Ewing Boulevard, Ewing, New Jersey 08628, Attention: Secretary. Such correspondence (other than solicitations) will be logged in and forwarded to the Lead Director.

[END TABLE]
Although we do not have a formal policy requiring attendance of directors at our Annual Meetings, we expect all directors to attend the Annual Meeting absent exceptional circumstances. All incumbent directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Audit Committee.    Under its Charter, the Audit Committee, among other responsibilities, (i) has sole authority to retain, set compensation and retention terms for, terminate, and oversee and evaluate the activities of, our independent registered public accounting firm; (ii) reviews and approves in advance the performance of all audit and permitted non-audit services, subject to the pre-approval policy discussed below under "Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services"; (iii) reviews and discusses with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements and certain other disclosures included in our filings with the SEC; (iv) reviews and discusses with management earnings press releases prior to their release; (v) discusses with management, internal audit personnel, and our independent registered public accounting firm, our risk assessment and risk management policies, including our major financial risk exposures and the security of the Company's computerized information systems; (vi) oversees the internal audit function; (vii) discusses with management, internal audit personnel, and our independent registered public accounting firm the adequacy and effectiveness of our financial reporting processes, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures; and (viii) oversees the adoption, periodic review, and oversight of policies and procedures regarding business conduct and oversees our compliance and ethics program. 
Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Shearer and Mr. Winkleblack is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations. 
The Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters and the receipt of confidential, anonymous submissions by our employees with respect to concerns regarding potential violations of our compliance and ethics program, including questionable accounting or auditing matters. Such complaints and submissions may be made by writing to the following address: Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Princeton South Corporate Park, 500 Charles Ewing Boulevard, Ewing, New Jersey 08628, Attention: Secretary. Complaints may also be made via the Internet at www.churchdwight.ethicspoint.com, or by calling our toll-free hotline. The Audit Committee regularly receives reports regarding potential violations of our compliance and ethics program and oversees certain investigations relating thereto. The number for calls placed within the United States and Canada is (855) 384-9879. The numbers for calls placed in other countries may be found on the Internet at www.churchdwight.ethicspoint.com. Such correspondence will be logged in and forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee or his/her designated delegates, who provide the Audit Committee with regular reports. 
Compensation & Organization Committee.    Under its Charter, the Compensation & Organization Committee is responsible for approving the specific salary, bonuses, stock awards, and other compensation for our elected officers, which includes our named executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54. The Compensation & Organization Committee also, among other responsibilities, (i) oversees the design of our executive compensation programs, policies, and practices; (ii) reviews and approves the adoption, termination, and amendment of, and administers, our incentive and equity compensation plans; (iii) reviews and approves annually corporate goals and objectives as they relate to CEO and other executive officer compensation; (iv) evaluates at least annually the performance of the CEO and the other executive officers and establishes their respective compensation; (v) evaluates whether our compensation policies and practices for our executive officers and other employees create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us; (vi) collaborates with the Governance & Nominating Committee, regarding recommendations to our Board of Directors concerning executive officer succession; (vii) collaborates with the Governance & Nominating Committee, regarding recommendations to our Board of Directors concerning non-employee director compensation; and (viii) recommends to the Board the development, selection, retention, and dismissal of elected officers. 
In considering executive compensation, the Compensation & Organization Committee considers the executive compensation recommendations as well as the comparative public company data provided by independent compensation consultants engaged directly by the Compensation & Organization Committee. Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") serves as the Compensation & Organization Committee independent compensation consultant and does not provide any other services to us. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for additional information regarding the services provided by Semler Brossy and information considered by the Compensation & Organization Committee. The Compensation & Organization Committee also takes into account statistical data and recommendations of our CEO. However, our CEO does not make recommendations regarding his own compensation. 
Governance & Nominating Committee.    Under its Charter, the Governance & Nominating Committee, among other responsibilities, (i) develops and periodically reviews, and recommends to our Board of Directors, criteria for the selection of new directors to serve on our Board of Directors; (ii) identifies individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors consistent with our Board of Directors' criteria for selecting new directors set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines; (iii) recommends to our Board of Directors nominees for the class of directors to be elected at the next annual meeting of stockholders and, where applicable, to fill vacancies; (iv) considers and makes recommendations to our Board of Directors on questions of independence and possible conflicts of interest of members of our Board of Directors and executive officers in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines; (v) in collaboration with the Compensation & Organization Committee, makes recommendations to our Board of Directors concerning executive officer succession; (vi) oversees Board of Directors and committee evaluations; (vii) makes recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding corporate governance matters; and (viii) in consultation with the Compensation & Organization Committee, periodically reviews and makes recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding the compensation of our non-employee directors, and the principles upon which such compensation is determined. The Governance & Nominating Committee also oversees our sustainability program. 
The Governance & Nominating Committee recommends to our Board of Directors candidates for nomination to our Board of Directors. When considering individuals to recommend for nomination, the Governance & Nominating Committee seeks persons with diverse backgrounds who possess the following characteristics: integrity, education, commitment to our Board of Directors, business judgment, business experience, accounting and financial expertise, diversity, reputation, civic and community relationships, high performance standards, and the ability to act on behalf of stockholders. 
The Governance & Nominating Committee will consider recommendations for director candidates from stockholders. Stockholder recommendations of candidates should be submitted in writing to: Church & Dwight Co., Inc., Princeton South Corporate Park, 500 Charles Ewing Boulevard, Ewing, New Jersey 08628, Attention: Secretary. In order to enable consideration of a candidate in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder must submit the following information by November 22, 2019: (i) the name of the candidate and information about the candidate that would be required to be included in a proxy statement under the rules of the SEC; (ii) information about the relationship between the candidate and the recommending stockholder; and (iii) the written consent of the candidate to be named in the proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected. In considering any candidate proposed by a stockholder, the Governance & Nominating Committee will reach a conclusion as to whether to recommend such candidate to our Board of Directors based on the criteria described above. The Governance & Nominating Committee may seek additional information regarding the candidate. After full consideration, the stockholder recommending the candidate will be notified of the decision of the Governance & Nominating Committee (and of our Board of Directors, if the candidate is recommended to our Board of Directors for consideration). The Governance & Nominating Committee will consider all potential candidates in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation. 
As highlighted in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board values diversity and recognizes the importance of having unique and complementary backgrounds and perspectives in the board room. The Board endeavors to include diverse skills, professional experience, perspectives, age, race, ethnicity, gender and cultural backgrounds that reflect our consumer and investor base, and to guide the Company in a way that reflects the best interests of all our stockholders. Although the Board does not establish specific goals with respect to diversity, the Board's overall diversity is a significant consideration in the director nomination process. The Governance & Nominating Committee reviews the director nominees (including any stockholder nominees) and ascertains whether, as a whole, they meet the Corporate Governance Guidelines in this regard. For this year's election, the Board has nominated three individuals who bring valuable diversity to the Board. Their collective experience covers a wide range of roles, geographies, and industries. The Board also believes that tenure diversity should be considered in order to achieve an appropriate balance between the detailed Company knowledge and wisdom that comes with many years of service and the fresh perspective of newer Board members. We believe that our current Board has an appropriate balance of experienced and newer directors, with tenure of the current directors averaging 11 years. The Governance & Nominating Committee balances these considerations when assessing the composition of our Board of Directors. The Governance & Nominating Committee may engage the services of third party search firms to assist in identifying and assessing the qualifications of director candidates. 
Executive Committee.    The Executive Committee may exercise the authority of our Board of Directors, except as specifically reserved by Delaware law to our Board of Directors or as our Board of Directors otherwise provides. 
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
Our Board of Directors recognizes that one of its most important duties is to ensure excellence and continuity in our senior leadership by overseeing the development of executive talent and planning for the effective succession of the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our CEO and other senior members of executive management. Our succession planning process was evidenced in January 2016 when Matthew T. Farrell, our former Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, succeeded Mr. Craigie as our President and CEO; Richard A. Dierker, our former Vice President, Corporate Finance, succeeded Mr. Farrell as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Britta B. Bomhard, our former General Manager, Europe, was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. Most recently, our succession planning process was evidenced in March 2018, when Louis H. Tursi, Jr., our Executive Vice President, North America Sales, communicated his intention to retire in the first quarter of 2019, allowing us sufficient time to evaluate internal and external candidates to succeed him. Mr. Paul R. Wood, our new Executive Vice President, U.S. Sales joined the Company, in October of 2018, as Mr. Tursi's successor. 
Our CEO and other senior executive succession planning process includes identifying external candidates and identifying and developing potential internal candidates on an ongoing basis. The criteria used when assessing the qualifications of potential CEO successors are included on a position specification developed by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors is committed to being prepared for a planned or unplanned change in our leadership in order to ensure our stability. 
In continuation of this process, the Governance & Nominating Committee, in collaboration with the Compensation & Organization Committee, agrees upon and recommends to the Board a succession plan for our CEO and other senior members of executive management in the ordinary course of business and in emergency situations. Through this process, our Board of Directors receives from our CEO and the Executive Vice President of Global Human Resources qualitative evaluations of, and recommendations concerning, potential successors to our CEO and our other senior executives, along with a review of any development plans recommended for such individuals. At least once annually, our Board of Directors reviews our succession plans. Succession planning is also regularly discussed in executive sessions of our Board of Directors and in committee meetings, as applicable. Our directors become familiar with internal potential successors for key leadership positions through various means, including a comprehensive annual talent and succession review, Board of Directors and committee meeting presentations, and less formal interactions throughout the course of the year. 
CODE OF CONDUCT 
We have adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all employees and directors of Church & Dwight and our worldwide subsidiaries. Among other things, the Code of Conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships, promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures in periodic reports we are required to file, promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations and promote a harassment-free work environment. The Code of Conduct requires the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and contains provisions regarding accountability for adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is available on the "Investors" page of our website at www.churchdwight.com. We are committed to satisfying the disclosure requirements regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Code of Conduct, including the conduct of an executive officer or member of our Board, by making disclosures concerning such matters available on the "Investors" page of our website.

SUSTAINABILITY 
Our Governance & Nominating Committee oversees our sustainability program. We maintain a strong heritage of commitment to people and the planet and believe that sustainable operations are both financially beneficial and critical to the health of the communities in which we operate. In 2018, we continued to progress on our commitment to robust and transparent environmental, social and governance practices. In addition, we continued to place considerable focus and effort on our supplier base through the execution of our responsible sourcing program. We place a high priority on operating in a responsible and respectful manner. 
We have received various external recognitions for our continued progress in various areas of corporate responsibility, including inclusion in the 2018 Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list and the EPA's Green Power Partnership Top 100 list. In addition, the Company ranked in the Drucker Institute/WSJ "Management Top 250 List" while also ranking in the JUST Capital "America's Most Just Companies" list and the FTSE4Good Index Series. 
Our global sustainability platform focuses on doing what's right in conducting our business to ensure that we preserve the environment for future generations and provide a safe and healthy working environment for colleagues while promoting the continued success of our commercial enterprise. Our global sustainability platform is derived directly from our organizational values and is a key component of our leadership strategy. At the core of our sustainability efforts are six pillars:

Each year we publish a Sustainability Report that highlights the intersection of our business and corporate responsibility commitments by reporting our financial, environmental, social, and governance performance. For more information regarding the Company's sustainability initiatives please see the "Responsibility" page on our website. 
We have also adopted Global Operating Guiding Principles as part of our Responsible Sourcing Program.

In 2005, we established the Church & Dwight Employee Giving Fund, Inc. (EGF), an employee-run giving program, where employees' donations are matched dollar-for-dollar by us.

  *  Our Lead Director is currently Chair of the Governance & Nominating Committee and receives $10,000 for serving  in that role.  
[END TABLE]
We pay fees to our directors in accordance with the Amended and Restated Compensation Plan for Directors (as amended), (the "Compensation Plan for Directors"). Any fees payable to our directors under this plan may be deferred in accordance with our Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, provided that a timely election is made by the director seeking such deferral. We also provide annual stock option awards to our directors under the Amended and Restated Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the "Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan"). All of these arrangements are described below. 
Compensation Plan for Directors.    Our Compensation Plan for Directors became effective as of January 1, 2015, and provides for the payment of fee-based compensation (i.e., an annual retainer and any special assignment meeting fees) and annual equity grants to our directors who are not full-time employees of the Company. Special assignment meeting fees are paid in consideration for attendance at meetings with respect to certain non-scheduled activities and projects requested by the Board. No special assignment meeting fees were paid in fiscal year 2018. The annual retainer amount is pro-rated for any director with less than a full year of service. 
The Compensation Plan for Directors provides each director with the choice of receiving (i) 100 percent of his/her fee-based compensation in cash if that director has fully satisfied the Company's Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors, (ii) 50 percent cash and 50 percent in shares of our common stock if specifically elected by a director or (iii) 100 percent in shares of our common stock (the default method of payment). For 2018, our directors made their election for how to receive their fee-based compensation in December 2017. To determine the number of shares a director is entitled to receive under the plan, the annual retainer or special assignment meeting fee amount (as applicable) is divided by the closing price of a share of our common stock as reported on the NYSE on the applicable payment date. 
Annual Equity Grants for Directors.    The Compensation Plan for Directors provides that, unless otherwise established by our Board of Directors, equity grants to our non-employee directors will be made annually on the same date each year on which we make annual equity grants to our employees (which date occurs on the Monday falling most closely to the midpoint between the dates of our first and second quarter earnings releases). A new director will receive his or her initial equity grant on the date such individual commences service with us as a director. In 2018, as in prior years, the annual equity grants were comprised of stock option awards. All shares underlying the stock options granted to non-employee directors vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director's continued service on our Board of Directors. Upon any cessation of service due to death or disability, the stock options (to the extent unvested) continue to vest and all unexercised options remain outstanding until the third anniversary of such death or disability (or earlier until expiration of the option term). For any director who retires after serving on our Board of Directors for at least six years, the stock options (to the extent unvested) continue to vest and all unexercised options remain outstanding for the remainder of the option term. Stock options to our non-employee directors are granted under the Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan with a ten-year term. No non-employee director may receive more than one equity grant in any calendar year. 
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors.    The Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors provides an opportunity for our directors to defer payment of all or a portion of their respective director fees into a notional account until after termination of service. A director electing to defer payment must decide whether to receive the deferred payment in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years. A director must make any of the foregoing elections prior to the beginning of the calendar year for which the deferred fees are earned. Also, newly elected directors may make such election within 30 days of becoming a director. A director's election is deemed to remain in effect with respect to the following year unless the director revokes or changes such election prior to the commencement of such following year. Following a termination of service, the director generally receives a number of shares of our common stock in accordance with his or her timely filed election, either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years, equal to the number of notional shares then outstanding in the director's deferred compensation account under the plan. On a change in control, any and all deferred accounts (including any account being paid in installments) will be immediately distributed. The number of notional shares represented by amounts in a participating director's account is set forth in the table captioned "Securities Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" on page 32. 
2019 Director Compensation.    On October 31, 2018, the Governance & Nominating Committee, in consultation with the Compensation & Organization Committee, reviewed the compensation of our non-employee directors. As part of their review, the Committees consulted with Semler Brossy, the independent compensation consultant retained by the Compensation & Organization Committee. As part of its analysis of the compensation of our non-employee directors, Semler Brossy examined how the total compensation and each element of our non-employee director compensation program compared to the director compensation programs of our Compensation Peer Group, as identified and discussed in more detail on pages 41-42. The Governance & Nominating Committee targets the total compensation paid to our non-employee directors at a level that approximates the 50th percentile of the compensation paid to non-employee directors of the Compensation Peer Group. Based on its analysis, Semler Brossy concluded that the total compensation paid to our non-employee directors was generally in line with the median of the director compensation of the Compensation Peer Group, and, based upon its review, the Governance & Nominating Committee recommended to the Board that no changes be made to the Board of Directors compensation for fiscal year 2019. 
The following table provides information regarding compensation for our non-employee directors in 2018.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR DIRECTORS 
Our non-employee directors are expected to have a level of equity ownership in the Company in order to ensure that their interests are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. It is expected that each non-employee director will have, within five years from the date on which they join the Board, a number of shares having a value of at least five times the standard annual retainer (which is the annual retainer received by any director who is not a committee chair, the Lead Director or the Chairman). The annual retainer was $110,000 for 2018 and the dollar value of shares required to be held by our directors who have served five or more years was $550,000 as of December 31, 2018. The calculation of ownership includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares owned by the director (or members of his or her immediate family residing in the same household),   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notional shares held for the account of the director in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares held in a trust for which a director has shared voting or investment power, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 60 percent of the in-the-money value of  vested and unvested stock options.  
[END TABLE]
Until a non-employee director satisfies his or her stock ownership requirement, the director will be required to hold 50 percent of all shares of our common stock received upon the exercise of stock options, grants of stock, or upon lapse of the restrictions on restricted stock (in each case, net of any shares utilized to pay for the exercise price of an option and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations). All of our non-employee directors who have been in their position for five years or more own enough shares to satisfy our guidelines.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
INTRODUCTION 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis addresses the compensation paid for 2018 to our named executive officers, which include our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and our three other most highly-compensated executive officers. Our named executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Matthew T. Farrell    President and Chief Executive Officer 
 Richard A.  Dierker    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
 Louis H. Tursi,  Jr.*    Former Executive Vice President, North America Sales 
 Patrick D. de Maynadier    Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary 
 Britta B. Bomhard    Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer 
   *  Mr. Tursi retired from the Company on January 4, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation & Organization Committee or the "Committee", reviews the executive compensation program each year for alignment with our business strategy and evolving market and governance practices for executive compensation. We believe that our current programs are aligned with the Company's business priorities and designed to encourage shareholder value creation. 
As part of the foregoing analysis, the Committee evaluates the relationship between pay and performance of our named executive officers. The analysis includes a review of the relationship between the compensation paid to the CEO and the other named executive officers and Company performance relative to roles within other similarly sized companies that have generally corresponding responsibilities. For 2018, the analysis shows a strong link between Company pay and Company performance as it relates to key operating measures. 
We focus on the following objectives in making compensation determinations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation that is competitive in markets in which we compete for management talent. We refer to this objective  as "competitive compensation."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Condition the majority of a named executive officer's compensation on a combination of short and long-term  performance. We refer to this objective as "performance incentives."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage the aggregation and maintenance of meaningful equity ownership, and the alignment of executive officer and  stockholder interests as an incentive to increase stockholder value. We refer to this objective as "alignment with stockholder interests."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide an incentive for long-term continued employment with us. We refer to this objective as "retention  incentives."  
[END TABLE]
2018 Key Business Highlights and Strong Pay for Performance Alignment 
2018 Financial Results 
During 2018 we delivered the following results for Net Sales, Gross Margin, Diluted EPS, and Cash from Operations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Net Sales: $4,146MM  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Gross Margin: 44.4 percent  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Diluted EPS: $2.27  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Cash from Operations: $764MM  
[END TABLE]
As discussed further below, these metrics are used to measure performance under our Annual Incentive Plan. 
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
In consideration of the strong financial performance outlined above and the competitive market for executive pay, the Committee made the following compensation decisions in 2018 with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers: 
Base Salary.    The Committee increased our named executive officers' base salaries by approximately 3 percent each, to further align with the corresponding median levels of our Compensation Peer Group (as described below) and industry survey data. 
Annual Incentive Plan.    The Committee maintained the target bonus percentage for each named executive officer at the same level as in 2017. For more information, see the Annual Incentive Plan on page 43. 
Option Grants.    The Committee increased the percent of salary measurement for stock option grants, based on competitive market data, for the CEO, CFO, Mr. de Maynadier and Ms. Bomhard to 425 percent, 165 percent, 145 percent and 100 percent, respectively, with Mr. Tursi's remaining at 92 percent. For more information, see "Long Term Incentives—Stock Options and Restricted Stock" on page 46. 
Additional Bonus Awards.    In addition to its consideration of the compensation paid to executives of the Company's Compensation Peer Group, the Committee compared the Company's results with respect to EPS growth and Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") against a group (the "TSR Peer Group") of consumer-packaged goods companies more closely aligned with the Company's business than the Compensation Peer Group listed on page 42 because our TSR performance is more competitively aligned with those companies. We used the TSR Peer Group solely for the purpose of measuring such metrics. The Committee determined that comparing our 2018 results against the members of the TSR Peer Group that more directly compete in our category groups provided a better indication of the Company's actual results. For 2018, the TSR Peer Group consisted of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clorox Co.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Procter & Gamble Co.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Kimberly Clark Corp.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Energizer Holdings Inc.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reckitt Benckiser Group plc  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Newell Brands Inc.  
[END TABLE]
We achieved extraordinary results by delivering EPS growth of 17 percent, and we delivered extraordinary TSR of 33.2 percent, which was in the top 10 percent of our TSR Peer Group. As a result, management recommended, and the Committee approved, a special 15 percent discretionary bonus payout to reward all employees (including the named executive officers) for their significant contributions toward these strong achievements in 2018. These discretionary bonuses for the named executive officers are set forth in the "Bonus" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 54. 
2018 COMPENSATION 
The principal components of 2018 compensation that we paid to our named executive officers designed to meet our compensation objectives are as follows: 
The following table summarizes some highlights of our compensation practices that drive our compensation programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
☑    A majority of our executive compensation is performance based.          ☒   No hedging, pledging or short sales by our named executive officers with respect to Company securities.

DETERMINATION OF COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION 
In making executive compensation decisions for 2018, the Committee reviewed data provided by Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC, the Committee's independent compensation consultant ("Semler Brossy"), to compare the compensation of our named executive officers to the compensation of executives in the competitive market. The Committee referenced data provided by Willis Towers Watson and Equilar, reflecting companies in the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors within the Company's revenue scope, to assist in decisions regarding base pay, short-term incentive targets under our Annual Incentive Plan and long-term incentives. 
The compensation peer group is a group of consumer-packaged goods companies that have revenues in the range of approximately 50 – 200 percent of our revenues (the "Compensation Peer Group"). Within this classification, the Committee referenced companies with similar distribution channels and with a significant focus on brand recognition. We believe there is a strong likelihood that the skills of our named executive officers are transferable among the companies in the Compensation Peer Group, so we would expect to compete with these companies for executive officer talent. Below is a chart that shows the process used to determine the 2018 Compensation Peer Group and 2018 Compensation Peer Group financial ranking: 
Process for Determining Compensation Peer Group 
The Committee primarily utilizes data with respect to the Compensation Peer Group for our CEO and CFO. With respect to our other named executive officers, the Committee primarily uses survey data in determining compensation. The Committee also references Compensation Peer Group data in determining the compensation of our other named executive officers when there is a meaningful level of relevant data for those positions. 
In determining a 2018 competitive market guideline with respect to total direct compensation, namely base salary, short-term incentive targets and long-term incentives, the Committee referenced a level that approximates the 50th percentile of the Compensation Peer Group, or the survey companies, as applicable. However, the Committee did not follow this guideline rigidly as a result of the Company's strong absolute performance compared to annual incentive targets as well as the Company's extraordinary performance relative to the TSR Peer Group, as discussed below with respect to the Annual Incentive Plan. In addition, because a majority of our compensation is performance-based, actual cash compensation paid to our named executive officers could further vary from that paid to executive officers in the Compensation Peer Group or the survey companies, based on achievement of performance targets. 
MIX OF PAY 
On average, approximately 84 percent of the CEO's target compensation and 65 percent of the other named executive officers' target compensation is variable, based on Company and individual performance. Variable compensation consists of the target Annual Incentive Plan payout and the target value of stock options granted. The percentages below are calculated by dividing each compensation element by target total compensation, which consists of base salary, target Annual Incentive Plan compensation plus long-term incentives. 
SALARIES 
In 2018, the CEO, the CFO and each of the other named executive officers each received base salary increases of approximately 3 percent, which was consistent with market increases for this period. 
Compensation of each of our named executive officers is set forth on the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 54. 
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN 
Our Annual Incentive Plan utilizes four equally weighted metrics, namely: Net Sales, Gross Margin, Diluted EPS and Cash from Operations. 
The principal objective of the Annual Incentive Plan is to align executive and stockholder interests by providing an incentive to our named executive officers to achieve annual performance goals that also support long-term stockholder return. The performance goals are established each year to reflect specific objectives set in our annual budget. The Committee also considers competitive factors, including competitive market data for total cash compensation, which includes salary and annual incentive bonus, in determining the amount of annual incentive award opportunities for our named executive officers. 
As noted above, in structuring total direct compensation for our named executive officers, we have referenced the median level of direct compensation of the Compensation Peer Group and survey data. This median has influenced our incentive compensation target award levels, although we have from time to time set target payouts above the median level when we believed that our planned performance was well ahead of our TSR Peer Group targets. 
The Committee uses a numerical performance rating system with a range from 0.0 to 2.0 to determine the payout amounts under the Annual Incentive Plan. A rating of 1.0 normally represents the target achievement level for plan performance with payout based on each participant's annual incentive compensation award target percentage of his or her annual base salary. For 2018, we set payout amounts for performance at plan levels that were 10 percent above the amounts that would be paid with respect to a 1.0 rating (or a 1.1 rating) because our budgeted EPS growth on a percentage basis was significantly more challenging to achieve than the budgeted EPS growth of the TSR Peer Group. As a result, if 2018 operating plan level performance (i.e., target) was achieved, the participant received an award payout representing a 1.1 rating. Actual results for 2018 resulted in a performance rating of 1.18. The Company delivered superior EPS year over year growth of 17 percent. In addition to the strong absolute performance compared to the annual incentive targets, the Company demonstrated extraordinary TSR of 33.2 percent, which ranks in the top 10 percent of the TSR Peer Group. To recognize this outstanding performance, the Committee increased the annual incentive compensation award pool for all employees, including the named executive officers, by 15 percent, resulting in a total Annual Incentive Plan payout of 1.36. The bonus payable under our Annual Incentive Plan is included in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 54. The incremental amount is included in the "Bonus" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 54. The following table indicates the percentage of salary payable at a 1.0 rating, the percentage of salary payable at a 1.1 rating and the award opportunity for 2018, based on a 1.1 rating for each of our named executive officers:

[END TABLE]
As described above, in 2018 the Committee referenced competitive compensation data provided by Semler Brossy in setting the percentage levels. 
The 2018 corporate performance metrics, their weightings and a description of the rationale for each measure are as follows: 
The Committee has discretion to adjust the corporate results used to compute performance based on external circumstances or unanticipated business conditions that are not within the reasonable control of our management or that do not generally reflect or directly relate to our day-to-day operations in the ordinary course. The following table indicates, with respect to each corporate performance measure, the threshold level of 2018 performance for which a payout could be made, the target performance level, the maximum performance level, and the actual performance and performance ratings. To the extent applicable, the amounts and percentages reflect the positive and negative adjustments approved by the Committee to eliminate the effect of foreign exchange rates that differed from budgeted amounts, the impact of the unplanned acquisition of Passport, Inc. and Chinese tariffs on the Waterpik business.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVES—STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK 
Stock Options 
In 2018, the Committee continued to utilize options on our common stock as our principal form of long-term compensation. The number of shares underlying options granted to our named executive officers is calculated by designating an amount equal to a percentage of the named executive officer's salary, and dividing that amount by the grant date fair value of the shares underlying the option, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Stock options granted in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have a 10-year term,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vest as to all underlying shares on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to continued service through such  vesting date, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share on the date of grant, which the Committee determines based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE on the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that stock options provide a strong incentive to increase stockholder value, because the value of the stock options is directly dependent on the market performance of our common stock following the date of grant. 
Under our long-term incentive program, the Committee grants stock options to each of our named executive officers on an annual basis, based on a percentage of the executive officer's salary. In connection with our 2018 grants, the Committee used the following percentages of salary based on market data for our named executive officers: 
Named Executive Officers 
Stock Option Grants as Percent of Salary 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Percentage of Salary   
 Matthew T.  Farrell      425%  
 Richard A.  Dierker      165%  
 Louis H. Tursi,  Jr.      92%  
 Patrick D. de  Maynadier      145%  
 Britta B. Bomhard      100%  
[END TABLE]
The number of shares underlying options for each of our named executive officers is calculated by designating an amount equal to a percentage of the named executive officer's salary, and dividing that amount by the grant date fair value of the shares underlying the option, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, rounded to the nearest 10 shares. The grant date fair value of the stock options is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The number of shares underlying stock options granted to our named executive officers are set forth below in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table under the column heading, "All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options." For additional information regarding stock option terms, see the narrative accompanying the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table. 
The Committee has, from time to time, considered the structure of our long-term incentive compensation, which continues to consist entirely of stock options. The Committee continues to believe that stock options are the most effective and appropriate form of long-term incentive compensation for the Company to use at this time. On an ongoing basis, it reviews with management and our Board the advisability of adopting alternative forms of long-term incentive compensation that are tied to, and provide incentives for, the long-term increase in stockholder value. 
In 2018, the Committee amended the Stock Option Grant Agreement for Employees to allow for the exercise of option grants up to the expiration of their full term, post-retirement (the "New Option Provision"). Options granted to our named executive officers in 2018 included the New Option Provision. Since 2007, our stock option grants included provisions enabling a three-year post-termination vesting and exercise period (the "Old Option Provision" and, together with the New Option Provision, the "Option Provisions"). The Option Provisions apply if (i) the option holder's employment terminates due to retirement, as defined in the grant agreement, or is terminated by us without cause; (ii) the option holder is at least 55 years old and has completed at least five years of service with us; (iii) the sum of the option holder's age and years of service is at least 65; and (iv) pursuant to our request, the option holder has signed a waiver and release agreement. We believe that the Option Provisions enable us to attract and retain seasoned executives who have considerable experience. Moreover, we believe the Option Provisions offset the effect of the three-year cliff vesting provisions of our stock options, which we believe are less favorable than vesting provisions used by many of the Compensation Peer Group. Many of those companies provide for incremental vesting of stock options during the vesting period, while our options do not vest until they have been held for three years. We believe the Option Provisions encourage our employees to maintain employment with us for an extended period of time and to align their interests with longer-term Company performance. 
Restricted Stock 
On July 18, 2018, the Board granted 1,000 shares of restricted stock to each of Mr. Dierker and Ms. Bomhard. The shares of restricted stock will vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date to encourage retention of these executives who have exhibited sustained superior performance. 
PERQUISITES AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS 
We provide very limited perquisites to our executive officers. Our executives may receive a comprehensive physical examination through a provider selected by the executive from among three providers that we have approved. We believe it is in our best interest to ensure that our executives' health is monitored so that any health-related issues pertaining to an executive can be identified and addressed promptly. The average cost to us for providing this benefit in 2018 is approximately $2,600 per executive. 
Except as noted above, we currently do not have programs for providing personal benefit perquisites to executive officers. From time to time the Company makes donations to non-profit organizations or educational institutions as requested by our executive officers and directors. The aggregate amount of all such donations with respect to named executive officers was $51,500 in 2018. 
2019 COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
The Compensation & Organization Committee approved the 2019 salary increases and long-term incentive adjustment based on the market rate. The Compensation & Organization Committee approved the increase of the percent of salary measurement for stock option grants for Mr. Farrell under the Company's long-term incentive program from 425 percent to 530 percent, for Mr. Dierker from 165 percent to 220 percent, for Mr. de Maynadier from 145 percent to 150 percent and, for Ms. Bomhard from 100 percent to 105 percent. Base salary was increased as indicated in the table below.

STOCK OPTION GRANT PRACTICES 
The Compensation & Organization Committee makes annual stock option grants to executive officers and other employees effective on the Monday falling most closely to the midpoint between the dates of the Company's first and second quarter earnings releases. A grant to a new employee is effective on the date the employee commences employment with us, and special grants made to employees at times other than the time of the annual grant are effective on the first trading day of the month following approval of the grant. The per share exercise price of stock options is equal to the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. We believe that our stock option grant practices are appropriate and eliminate any questions regarding "timing" of grants in anticipation of material events, since grants become effective in accordance with a long-standing schedule. 
The Compensation & Organization Committee delegates to our CEO and the Executive Vice President, Global Human Resources the ability to approve a specific number of stock option grants for employees who are not executive officers. The grants may be made at times other than the time of annual grant and are utilized for new hires and for performance recognition purposes. The Compensation & Organization Committee approved options to purchase 207,700 shares for these purposes in 2018. The timing and pricing of the option grants in 2018 conformed to the Compensation & Organization Committee practices described in the preceding paragraph. 
We do not permit repricing of options without prior stockholder approval. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP, TRADING GUIDELINES AND SHORT SALE, HEDGING AND PLEDGING POLICIES 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In order to further align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, we maintain stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers. The guidelines specify that each executive officer must hold equity in the Company's stock equal to a multiple of each executive's salary. 
The stock ownership guidelines applicable to each of our named executive officers at the end of 2018 are shown in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Title    Multiple of Salary Subject to Guidelines   
 Chief Executive  Officer      6.0x   
 Chief Financial  Officer      3.0x   
 Executive Vice President      2.5x   
[END TABLE]
The calculation of ownership includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares acquired and held upon stock option exercises,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the value of any vested or unvested stock or restricted stock,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock held in the Company's Profit Sharing Plan,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock held in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• share equivalents held in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares held in trust,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares held outright, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 60 percent of the in-the-money value  of vested and unvested stock options.  
[END TABLE]
Executives are generally expected to achieve the guidelines within five years from the date on which they become subject to our stock ownership guidelines. If an executive is ever below their ownership requirements, under our guidelines, they must hold 50 percent of the net, after-tax value of any equity received from the Company's ongoing compensation programs. As of December 31, 2018, all of our executive officers who have been in their position for five years were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines. 
Trading, Short Sale, Hedging and Pledging 
Additionally, our insider trading policy prohibit our executive officers and directors from (i) buying or selling the Company's securities while in possession of material, non-public information relating to us, (ii) engaging in short sales of our securities, (iii) buying or selling puts or calls or other derivative securities on our securities, (iv) entering into hedging or monetizing transactions or similar arrangements with respect to our securities, and (v) holding our securities in a margin account or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan. 
ONGOING AND POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
We have plans and agreements addressing compensation for our named executive officers that accrue value as the executive officers continue to work for us, provide special benefits upon certain types of termination events, or provide retirement benefits. These plans and agreements were designed to be part of a competitive compensation package, in some cases not only for executive officers, but for other employees as well. 
SAVINGS AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES 
This plan, which we sometimes refer to below as the "Savings and Profit Sharing Plan," is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan available to all of our domestic salaried and hourly employees. All of our named executive officers participate in the plan. Under the plan, an employee may contribute, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations, up to a maximum of 70 percent of his or her eligible compensation (approximately 15 percent for highly compensated employees in 2018), which includes salary and payments under the Annual Incentive Plan, on a pre-tax basis or as Roth contributions. We provide a matching contribution equal to 100 percent of the first five percent of eligible compensation that an employee contributes in any year. In addition, the plan provides a profit-sharing feature under which we make an annual contribution to the account of each employee based on our performance in the preceding year. The performance measures and results used to calculate the annual contribution level are identical to the Company-wide measures described above under "2018 Compensation—Annual Incentive Plan." Achievement of the target performance rating would have resulted in a contribution of five percent of a participant's base salary and Annual Incentive Plan payments made in 2018. Based on 2018 performance results, the Compensation & Organization Committee approved a contribution equal to 6.8 percent of a participant's eligible compensation in 2018. Amounts credited to an employee's account in the plan may be invested among a number of funds, including a Company stock fund. A participant's account is adjusted to reflect the rate of return, positive or negative, on the investments. Employee contributions and compensation on which our profit sharing contributions may be based cannot exceed limits under the Internal Revenue Code (the eligible compensation limit was $275,000 in 2018). 
EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 
The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP") and its predecessors collectively have been in effect for over 20 years. The EDCP is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides potential tax benefits for certain employees, including our named executive officers. Under the EDCP as currently in effect, an executive officer can defer up to 85 percent of his or her salary and up to 85 percent of amounts paid to the executive officer under the Annual Incentive Plan. In addition, an executive can make a separate deferral, which we refer to below as the "Excess Compensation Deferral," of up to five percent of compensation that exceeds Internal Revenue Code limits on eligible contributions under the Savings and Profit Sharing Plan. We provide a contribution equal to (i) 100 percent of the Excess Contribution Deferral; (ii) five percent of other salary and Annual Incentive Plan deferrals; and (iii) the profit sharing contributions we would have made to the participant's account under the Savings and Profit Sharing Plan were it not for the Internal Revenue Code limit on the amount of eligible compensation under that plan and the participant's deferrals into the EDCP. 
Amounts deferred under the EDCP generally are not subject to federal, and in many cases state, income taxes until they are distributed. An executive officer can choose to have his or her contributions allocated to one or more of several notional investments, including a notional investment in our common stock. A participant may not initially allocate more than 50 percent of his or her contributions to our common stock, although the participant can increase the notional common stock amount through intra-plan transfers of notional investments previously made. A participant's account is adjusted to reflect the deemed rate of return, positive or negative, on the notional investments. An executive officer may choose to receive a payout following retirement, either in a lump sum or in annual installments, in accordance with the terms of the EDCP. The EDCP also includes provisions for payment upon termination (pre-retirement) death or disability. See the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table and accompanying narrative for additional information. 
CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS 
We have adopted change in control and severance agreements for our executive officers because we believe that these agreements can create management stability during a period of uncertainty. Absent such agreements, there is an increased risk that executive officers may be encouraged to seek other employment opportunities if they became concerned about their employment security following a change in control. We also believe that the agreements provide financial security to an executive officer in the event of an involuntary termination of the executive officer without cause following a change in control by providing a meaningful payment to the executive officer. The agreements also provide clear statements of the rights of the executive officers and protect against a change in employment and other terms by an acquirer that would be unfavorable to the executive officer. We also provide severance benefits to our executive officers, although at a lower level, for certain types of employment terminations that do not follow a change in control. We believe these obligations provide a competitive benefit that enhances our ability to hire and retain capable executive officers. 
The change in control and severance agreements provide for payments and other benefits if an executive officer's employment is terminated without cause, or if an executive officer terminates employment for "good reason," within two years following a change in control. These provisions require what is sometimes called a "double trigger," namely both a change in control and a specified termination event, before payment is made. The agreements also provide for lesser payments if these types of terminations occur outside of the context of a change in control. The agreements do not contain a tax gross-up provision and, instead, in the event that payments to be made to an executive under the agreements in connection with a change in control would result in the imposition of the excise tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, the payments will be reduced to the highest amount that could be paid without triggering the excise tax if, following the reduction, the executive would retain a greater amount of net after-tax payments than if no reduction were made. If no reduction is made, the executive officer will pay any applicable excise tax. 
See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 61-65 for further information regarding benefits under the change in control and severance agreements. 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of executive compensation paid by publicly held companies to certain of their executive officers to $1,000,000 per year, but has historically contained an exception for performance-based compensation. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates the exception for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. We have traditionally structured certain portions of our executive compensation program in a manner intended to preserve deductibility for federal income tax purposes under this provision. Nevertheless, our Compensation Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served if the Company's flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. As a result, our Compensation Committee has approved salaries and other awards for executive officers that were not fully deductible because of Section 162(m) and, in light of the repeal of the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m), expects in the future to approve compensation to current and former executive officers that is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we asked our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved compensation to our named executive officers, with over 95 percent of votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay resolution. We value this positive endorsement by our stockholders of our executive compensation policies. As we evaluated our compensation practices in fiscal 2018, we were mindful of the strong support our stockholders expressed for our pay-for-performance philosophy. As a result, the 
 Compensation & Organization Committee continued our general approach to executive compensation for 2018. We believe our programs are effectively designed, are working well, and are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation & Organization Committee will continue to seek and consider stockholder feedback in the future. 
ROLE OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN DETERMINING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
In connection with 2018 compensation for executive officers, Mr. Farrell, aided by our human resources department, provided statistical data and recommendations to the Compensation & Organization Committee. Mr. Farrell did not make recommendations as to his own compensation. While the Compensation & Organization Committee utilized this information, and valued Mr. Farrell's observations with regard to compensation for our other executive officers, the ultimate decisions regarding executive compensation were made by the Compensation & Organization Committee. 
ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION & ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE IN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As set forth in the Charter of the Compensation & Organization Committee, one of the Compensation & Organization Committee's purposes is to administer our executive compensation program. It is the Compensation & Organization Committee's responsibility to oversee the design of executive compensation programs, policies, and practices; to determine the types and amounts of compensation for executive officers; and to review and approve the adoption, termination, and amendment of, and to administer, our incentive compensation and stock option plans. All compensation for our executive officers ultimately must be approved by the Compensation & Organization Committee. Our human resources department supports the Compensation & Organization Committee's work, and in some cases, acts under delegated authority to administer compensation programs. In addition, as described above, the Compensation & Organization Committee directly engages Semler Brossy, an outside independent compensation consulting firm, to assist in its review of compensation for executive officers. 
COMPENSATION & ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation & Organization Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Based on its review and discussions, the Compensation & Organization Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and, through incorporation by reference, in Church & Dwight's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

2018 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
Our named executive officers are among the employees eligible to participate in the EDCP. Participants can elect to defer up to 85 percent of each of their salary and Annual Incentive Plan award payout. Amounts deferred are invested, as determined by the participant, in one or more notional investments, including a notional investment in our common stock. The other notional investments are based on a group of mutual funds. We also made contributions to a participant's deferred compensation account equal to the matching contributions and profit sharing contributions that would have been made to the participant's account under the Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Salaried Employees but for (i) limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on plan contributions, and (ii) the participant's deferrals under the EDCP. Following retirement, participants may elect to receive either a lump sum payment or installment payments for up to 20 years. A participant's interest in the portion of his or her account derived from our contributions vests, depending on the nature of the contribution, between two to five years from commencement of employment. 
The following table provides details regarding nonqualified deferred compensation for our named executive officers in 2018.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
In this section, we describe payments that may be made to our named executive officers upon several events of termination, including termination in connection with a change in control, assuming the termination event occurred on December 31, 2018 (except as otherwise noted). 
The information in this section does not include information relating to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• distributions under the EDCP—see "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" for information regarding this  plan,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other payments and benefits provided on a nondiscriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination of  employment, including our tax-qualified defined contribution plan,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted shares and shares underlying options that vested prior to the termination event—see the "2018  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• short-term incentive payments that would not be increased due to the termination event.  
[END TABLE]
CHANGE IN CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS 
We have entered into Change in Control and Severance Agreements with each named executive officer. The agreements provide for benefits upon specified termination of employment events within two years following a change in control and upon specified termination of employment events at any time for reasons unrelated to a change in control. A "change in control" occurs under the agreements if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a person becomes the beneficial owner of 50 percent or more of our common stock,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of a merger or other business combination or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• within any 24-month period, "incumbent directors" no longer constitute at  least a majority of our Board of Directors; "incumbent directors" are (i) persons who were directors immediately before the beginning of the 24-month period and (ii) persons who are elected  to our Board of Directors by a two-thirds vote of the incumbent directors.  
[END TABLE]
Upon the termination of an executive officer's employment without cause or by the executive officer for good reason, generally within two years following a change in control and following the executive officer's execution of a release, the executive officer will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to two times (three times for Mr. Farrell) the sum of such executive officer's base  salary plus target bonus award under the Annual Incentive Plan for the year in which such termination occurs, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to the executive officer's target bonus award under the Annual Incentive Plan multiplied by a  fraction equal to the portion of the year that has expired on the date of termination of employment.  
[END TABLE]
Each lump sum payment will be made six months following the date of termination of employment. 
Upon the termination of an executive officer's employment without cause or by the executive officer for good reason other than as a result of a change in control and following the executive officer's execution of a release, the executive officer will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to the executive officer's base salary (Mr. Farrell will receive an amount equal  to two times his base salary) for the year in which the termination occurs (one-half of the payment will be paid six months following the date of termination of employment and the remaining one-half will be paid in six equal monthly installments thereafter), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum payment equal to the Annual Incentive Plan award that would have been payable to the executive officer based on  actual performance multiplied by a fraction equal to the portion of the year that has expired on the date of termination of employment (to be paid on the later of the regularly scheduled payment date for the award and six months following the date  of termination of employment).  
[END TABLE]
"Good reason" means the occurrence of any of the following events, without the consent of the executive officer: (i) the executive officer suffers a material demotion in title, position, or duties; (ii) the executive officer's base salary and target award percentage or benefits are materially decreased; (iii) we fail to obtain the assumption of the agreement by an acquirer; or (iv) the executive officer's office location is moved by more than 50 miles. 
In the event that an executive officer becomes liable for payment of any excise tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 with respect to any "excess parachute payments" under Internal Revenue Code Section 280G to be received under the agreement in connection with a change in control, we will reduce the payments below the threshold amount for "excess parachute payments" set forth in Section 280G, if the reduction would provide the executive with greater net after-tax payments than would be the case if no reduction were made and the payments were subject to excise tax under Section 4999. 
In addition, under any event of termination covered by the agreement, the executive officer may elect to continue group medical and dental coverage at the then prevailing employee rate for a period of 24 months (12 months if termination occurs other than as a result of a change in control)—or, in the case of Mr. Farrell, 36 months (24 months if termination occurs other than as a result of a change in control) from the date of termination. The executive officer will also be entitled to receive (i) group life insurance coverage for a period of 24 months (12 months if termination occurs other than as a result of a change in control)—or, in the case of Mr. Farrell, 36 months (24 months if termination occurs other than as a result of a change in control) from the date of termination; (ii) outplacement assistance; and (iii) payment for unused vacation time. The agreement also contains non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions. 
The Change in Control and Severance Agreement replaced related provisions, if any, in the executive officer's employment agreement. 
In January 2016, our Board approved amendments to the Change in Control and Severance Agreement. 
ACCELERATION OF VESTING PROVISIONS PERTAINING TO STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Under the Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, upon a change in control all stock options and restricted stock granted prior to the change in control vest immediately, unless our Board of Directors determines otherwise. The definition of "change in control" under the Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan is substantially the same as the definition of "change in control" under the Change in Control and Severance Agreements. We believe this accelerated vesting can create management stability during a period of uncertainty, because there is an increased risk that executive officers may seek other employment opportunities if they became concerned about employment security following a change in control. 
TABLE OF BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION EVENTS 
The following tables show potential payments to our named executive officers upon termination of employment, including without limitation a change in control, assuming a December 31, 2018 termination date. In connection with the amounts shown in the table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock option benefit amounts for each option as to which vesting will be accelerated upon the occurrence of the termination  event are equal to the product of the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the difference between the exercise price per share of the option and the $65.76 closing price per share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, as  reported on the NYSE. Stock options continue to vest in accordance with the terms of grant for three years for named executive officers who either are terminated without cause or voluntarily terminate and, in each case, meet our "age plus years  of service" and other contractual qualifications for "retirement" treatment, and upon death or disability, in accordance with the terms of our plans. Because they do not accelerate, these amounts are not listed in the table. As of  December 31, 2018, Messrs. Farrell and de Maynadier met the minimum "age plus years of service" requirement for retirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock benefit amounts are equal to the product of the number of restricted shares as to which vesting will be  accelerated upon the occurrence of the termination event multiplied by the $65.76 closing price per share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, as reported on the NYSE. These benefit amounts are payable upon a voluntary termination of a  named executive officer, provided such officer meets our qualifications for "retirement," or upon the death or disability of such executive, in accordance with the terms of our plans. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Farrell and de  Maynadier met the minimum "age plus years of service" requirement for retirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Health and Welfare Benefits are equal to the costs we would incur to maintain such benefits for the applicable period.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We assumed that target award performance rating under the Annual Incentive Plan is met in the year of termination. Under  the Change in Control and Severance Agreements, if the named executive officer is terminated on December 31, he or she will be entitled to no additional payments with respect to this component beyond what the executive otherwise would have  earned under the Annual Incentive Plan. Therefore, no payment with respect to this component is reflected in the table.

CEO PAY RATIO 
We believe executive pay must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation & Organization Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our officers receive and the pay our non-officer employees receive. The compensation for our CEO in 2018 was approximately 113.6:1 times the 2018 pay for our median employee. 
As a result of the rules recently adopted by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), we are required to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee, using the required calculations. As permitted by the rules, we used the median employee identified in 2017 for our 2018 analysis. There was no significant change in the Company's employee population from 2017 to 2018 or in our compensation arrangements. In 2017 we examined the target total cash compensation (base salary plus target bonus) for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on November 30, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total target cash compensation. We excluded 73 employees from Brazil, which represented approximately 1.6 percent of the Company's total employee population of 4,500 as of November 30, 2017. We believe the use of total target cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. 
We calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement. 
As illustrated in the table below, our 2018 CEO to median employee pay ratio is 113.6:1.

PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
In accordance with the provisions of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are providing our stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Specifically, these rules address the information we must provide in the compensation discussion and analysis, compensation tables, and related disclosures included in this proxy statement. In accordance with the advisory vote of our stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we provide to our stockholders the opportunity to vote annually to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. Accordingly, the next vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers after the vote held at this Annual Meeting will be conducted at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
As described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our compensation objectives have focused on providing compensation that is competitive, includes meaningful performance incentives, aligns the interests of our executive officers and stockholders and provides an incentive for long-term continued employment with us. 
We believe that our compensation program, which includes meaningful, performance-based components, has met these objectives and has enabled us to attract, motivate, and retain talented executives who have helped us achieve strong financial results. Please refer to the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for a detailed discussion of the performance goals addressed by our incentive programs and our compensation programs generally. Moreover, we believe that our compensation program is aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders, and contributed to our achievement of an average annual total stockholder return over the past one, five, and ten years of 33.2 percent, 17.6 percent, and 20.5 percent, respectively. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we asked our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers. Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved compensation to our named executive officers, with over 95 percent of votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay resolution. We value this positive endorsement by our stockholders of our executive compensation policies. As we evaluated our compensation practices in fiscal 2018, we were mindful of the strong support our stockholders expressed for our pay-for-performance philosophy. As a result, the Compensation & Organization Committee continued our general approach to executive compensation for 2018. We believe our programs are effectively designed, are working well, and are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation & Organization Committee will continue to seek and consider stockholder feedback in the future. 
Accordingly, our Board of Directors recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Church & Dwight Co., Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
This is an advisory vote, which means that the stockholder vote is not binding on us. Nevertheless, the Compensation & Organization Committee values the opinions expressed by our stockholders, will continue to seek and consider stockholder feedback in the future, and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers. 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee selected Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as our independent registered public accountant for 2019. In accordance with past practice, this selection will be presented to our stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting; however, consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee has ultimate authority in respect of the selection of our auditors. The Audit Committee may reconsider its selection if the appointment is not ratified by our stockholders. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as our independent registered accountant since 1968. 
A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be in attendance at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will be afforded the opportunity to make a statement at the Annual Meeting, if he or she desires to do so. 
Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries to satisfy delivery requirements for notices of Internet availability of proxy materials and, if applicable, proxy statements and annual reports to stockholders, with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the material addressed to those stockholders. This process, commonly referred to as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate printing and postage costs. We and some brokers may household notices of Internet availability of proxy materials and, if applicable, annual reports to stockholders and proxy materials, by delivering a single copy of the material to multiple stockholders sharing the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. 
If a stockholder wishes in the future to receive a separate notice of Internet availability of proxy materials or, if applicable, the annual report to stockholders and proxy statement, or if a stockholder received multiple copies of some or all of these materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future, the stockholder should submit a request by telephone or in writing to the stockholder's broker if the shares are held in a brokerage account or, if the shares are registered in the name of the stockholder, to our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services LLC, 250 Royall Street, Canton, MA 02021, telephone: (866) 299-4219. We promptly will send additional copies of the relevant material following receipt of a request for additional copies. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our directors and executive officers, and persons holding more than 10 percent of our common stock, are required to file with the SEC initial reports of their ownership of our common stock and reports of changes in such ownership. To our knowledge, based on information furnished to us, all of these filing requirements were timely satisfied for 2018, except (i) the Form 4 for Mr. Linares filed on March 16, 2018 to report the withholding of shares upon the vesting of restricted stock on January 24, 2018, and (ii) the Form 4 for Mr. Farrell filed on June 25, 2018 to report the disposition of his spouse's shares of the Company's common stock. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
We are not aware of any matters, other than as indicated above, that will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote such proxy in their discretion on such matters.
