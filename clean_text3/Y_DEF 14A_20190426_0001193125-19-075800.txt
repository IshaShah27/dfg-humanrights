If you are unable to make the Annual Meeting, I encourage you to cast your vote on the items discussed in the Proxy Statement using the attached proxy card or by voting via telephone or online as detailed in the Proxy Statement. 
In 2019, Alleghany Corporation marks the 90th anniversary of its founding. The values that were instilled in this company by earlier generations continue to drive our success today. We believe that our culture is a competitive advantage and a key differentiator when recruiting, attracting acquisition candidates, and growing our business. 
Our Board of Directors is comprised of a group of committed and highly qualified individuals who care deeply about our company and bring a diverse set of experiences and perspectives to our Board deliberations. Our directors' skills and independent thought leadership have been invaluable to me and the management team in establishing our long-term business strategy and executing on that strategy. Appearing for the first time as a director candidate in the Proxy Statement is Lauren Tyler, who was appointed to the Board in January of this year. We are pleased that Lauren has joined the Board, bringing strategic, operational, and leadership capabilities which are only partly covered in the Proxy Statement. We encourage you to vote for her and the other directors on the ballot, as well as the other proposals, at the upcoming Annual Meeting. 
As we think about the past year and where we will take the company into the future, we remain committed to ensuring that pay is aligned with performance and the interests of our long-term stockholders. The Compensation Committee letter to stockholders on pages 39 and 40 provides more detailed perspective on this front. The Alleghany Board and management team are focused on creating long-term value for our stockholders, and our governance, strategy and management compensation are designed with this focus in mind. 
On behalf of Alleghany's Board and management, we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement will serve as your guide to the business to be conducted at the meeting this year.

Additional information regarding Alleghany's 2018 results, including audited consolidated financial statements, as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or "MD&A," with respect to 2018 results, is contained in Alleghany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2018, or the "Form 10-K," which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," on February 20, 2019. Readers are urged to review the Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of Alleghany's financial performance. 
Alleghany Long-Term Performance 
We believe that Alleghany's performance is best measured over the long term, and that long-term growth in common stockholders' equity per share is the best metric for evaluating such performance. In this regard, the table below shows the annual, and three- and ten-year average rolling, annualized growth in our common stockholders' equity per share, adjusted for a 2018 cash dividend and historical stock dividends, during the five-year period from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year    Three-Year      Ten-Year   
 2013      412.96        8.9        8.3        8.5   
 2014      465.51        12.7        10.8        8.6   
 2015      486.02        4.4        8.6        8.6   
 2016      515.24        6.0        7.7        7.8   
 2017      553.20        7.4        5.9        7.0   
 2018      527.75        (2.8)       3.4        7.2   
 Average            6.1        7.5        8.0   
[END TABLE]

As can be seen in the table above, Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share has compounded over the three- and ten-year periods in the range of Alleghany's stated strategic objective of 7-10% annual growth in common stockholders' equity per share, although it trailed that objective in 2018 and the three-year periods ending in 2017 and 2018 primarily due to a decline in the market value of Alleghany's equity portfolio in December 2018 and significant catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2018. 
The chart below summarizes Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share growth and stock price performance over the ten-year period from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2018, compared with the S&P 500 Stock Index, or the "S&P 500," with all values indexed to December 31, 2008. During this ten-year period, Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share increased at a compound annual rate of 7.2% (adjusted for dividends), compared with a compound annual rate of return of 13.1% for the S&P 500, and the price of Alleghany common stock (adjusted for dividends) appreciated at a 9.1% compound annual rate of return. 
As indicated by the data presented in the chart above, Alleghany's growth in common stockholders' equity per share has been relatively consistent, with the exception of 2018 when it was negatively impacted by a decline in the market value of Alleghany's equity portfolio and significant catastrophe losses. The trading price of Alleghany's common stock has been more volatile, reflecting the volatility of the stock market in general. In Alleghany's view, growth in common stockholders' equity per share is a better measure of fundamental performance and value creation as compared to the more volatile trading price of Alleghany's common stock. As such, Alleghany focuses its executive compensation incentive program on building common stockholders' equity per share over time. 
COMPENSATION SUMMARY 
Our executive compensation program is intended to provide competitive total compensation to each of Alleghany's executive officers (as listed on page 23), or the "Named Executive Officers," that is aligned with the interests of our stockholders in increasing our common stockholders' equity per share at rates of 7-10% over the long term without employing excessive amounts of financial leverage and without taking imprudent risks. This approach enables us to manage risk to avoid loss of capital during periods of economic turmoil, which we believe creates maximum value for stockholders in the long term, even if it results in lower levels of capital appreciation during periods when economic conditions are more favorable.

Elements of 2018 Compensation 
The principal elements of compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers and the percentage that these elements represent of the 2018 compensation for our chief executive officer and our other Named Executive Officers are reflected below. 
With respect to such components of 2018 compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CEO total direct compensation (salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity-based awards) was approximately  $8.0 million, representing approximately 0.2% of 2018 revenues, and total direct compensation for our Named Executive Officers as a group was approximately $18.4 million, representing approximately 0.4% of 2018 revenues.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 87.1% of Mr. Hicks's 2018 total direct compensation was linked to performance, while performance-linked  compensation for our other Named Executive Officers averaged 78.4% of total direct compensation in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
-6- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hicks's 2018 total direct compensation increased 4.2% from 2017 total direct compensation, mostly  due to a higher target long-term incentive award in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentive plan awards included a financial objective but also discretion given the nature of  Alleghany's business and long-term approach, with the discretionary aspect being restricted by the fact that payouts for 2018 were limited to the lesser of (i) approximately $6.2 million (representing the maximum potential payout for  our Named Executive Officers as a group) and (ii) 3% of 2018 annual adjusted pre-tax earnings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term performance share awards were subject to goals believed to be challenging to meet in today's low  interest rate and volatile market environment and that are aligned with our corporate financial objective of long-term growth in book value, with no payout being made if threshold performance is not achieved, and with our CEO's 2018 long-term  incentives based 100% on performance. No payouts for the performance share awards for the award period January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2018 were made in February 2019 as threshold performance was not achieved.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Compensation Summary 
During the ten-year performance period set out in the graph on page 5, we believe that Mr. Hicks's compensation has been well-aligned with Alleghany's long-term performance as can be seen in the table below:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I vote my shares by proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Because many stockholders cannot attend the 2019 Annual Meeting in person, it is necessary that a large number  of stockholders be represented by proxy. You may vote your proxy using the Internet, telephone or, if you received a printed copy of your proxy materials, mail, each as more fully explained below.

Q:  How can I vote my shares in person?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you wish to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, written ballots will be available at the meeting. If  your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from that holder of record to be able to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Voting by proxy, whether by Internet,  telephone or mail, will not limit your right to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting if you decide to attend in person. However, if you vote by proxy and also attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, there is no need to vote in person at the meeting unless you  wish to change your vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I attend the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You are entitled to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting if you were a stockholder of Alleghany as of the close of  business on March 1, 2019, the record date, or if you hold a valid proxy for the 2019 Annual Meeting. You should be prepared to present photo identification for admittance. If you are a stockholder of record, your name will be verified against  the list of stockholders of record on the record date prior to your admission to the 2019 Annual Meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but hold shares through a broker, bank or nominee (i.e., in street name), you should provide proof of  beneficial ownership on the record date, such as your most recent account statement prior to March 1, 2019, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker, bank or nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership. If you do not  provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined above, you may not be admitted to the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
The 2019 Annual Meeting will begin promptly on April 26, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., local time. You should allow adequate time for check-in procedures. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the 2019 Annual  Meeting by taking any one of the following actions: (1) follow the instructions given for changing your vote via the Internet or by telephone or deliver a valid written proxy with a later date than the previous proxy; (2) notify in writing  the Secretary of Alleghany that you have revoked your proxy (using the address in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders above); or (3) vote in person by written ballot at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a  bank, broker or other holder of record, you must contact that holder of record to revoke a previously authorized proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many shares must be present to conduct the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A quorum comprising the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Alleghany's common stock on the  record date, or 14,459,084 shares, must be present in person or represented by proxy for the transaction of business at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (which are  explained below) are counted as present to determine whether there is a quorum for the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give instructions to my broker?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you are considered the  beneficial owner of those shares, but not the record holder. As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your broker by the deadline provided in the proxy  materials you receive from your broker. Under the rules of the New York  
[END TABLE]
-10- 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for your shares but does not indicate a vote for a particular proposal because the broker does not have authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you. "Broker non-votes" are counted as present to determine whether there is a quorum for the 2019 Annual Meeting, but are not counted as votes for or against the proposal in question or as abstentions, nor are they counted to determine the number of votes present for the particular proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required to pass each of the proposals at the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proposal 1: Election of Directors. Each of the three nominees for director who receives at least a  majority of the votes cast with respect to the election of such nominee will be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. In accordance with the majority voting  standard in Alleghany's By-Laws, or the "By-Laws," and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of Alleghany, or the "Corporate Governance  Guidelines," as a condition of his or her nomination, each nominee is required to tender to the Board at the time of nomination an irrevocable resignation, effective if such nominee does not receive the majority vote required by the By-Laws and the Board determines to accept such resignation. In the event that a director nominee fails to receive the requisite majority vote, the Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate such resignation  and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether it should accept the resignation.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 2: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal is required to ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of this vote. The approval of Proposal 2 is a routine proposal on which a broker or other nominee is generally empowered to vote in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner, so broker non-votes are unlikely to result from this proposal. 
Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal is required to approve the advisory resolution on executive compensation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. Although this proposal is non-binding on the Board, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions about Alleghany's executive compensation program.

Q:  How does the Board recommend I vote?

A:  Karen Brenner, John G. Foos and Lauren M. Tyler have been nominated by the Board for election as directors at  the 2019 Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is a current member of the Board and was recommended to the Board for nomination by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee will receive at any time and will  consider from time to time suggestions from stockholders as to proposed director candidates, as described under "Directors' Nominations and Qualifications" on pages 18 and 19. Additionally, stockholders may nominate individuals for  election as directors in accordance with the requirements set forth in the By-Laws and described under "Stockholder Nominations and Proposals" on page 73.

In addition, we have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., or "Georgeson," to aid in the solicitation of proxies by mail, courier,  telephone, facsimile and e-mail. We expect to pay a fee of approximately $9,500 plus expenses to Georgeson for these services.

Q:  What is householding? Does Alleghany use it?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In accordance with a notice sent to eligible stockholders who share a single address, we are sending only one  annual report to stockholders and one proxy statement to that address unless we received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and  postage costs.  
[END TABLE]
If, in the future, you wish to receive a separate annual report to stockholders and proxy statement, a separate copy may be obtained, without charge, upon written or oral request to the office of the Secretary, Alleghany Corporation, 1411 Broadway, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10018, telephone number (212) 752-1356. Eligible stockholders of record who receive multiple copies of our annual report to stockholders and proxy statement can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. Stockholders who own shares through a bank, broker or other nominee can request householding by contacting the nominee. We hereby undertake to deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the annual report to stockholders and proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered.

Q:  Where can I find more information about Alleghany?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Alleghany's website address is www.alleghany.com. Alleghany makes available, free of charge on its  website, the documents it files with the SEC. Also available on Alleghany's website are its Financial Personnel Code of Ethics, Employee Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Director Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Business Conduct  and Ethics for Our Business Partners, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the charters for the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees. The information contained on Alleghany's website is not included as a part of, or  incorporated by reference into, this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
-12- 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board Composition 
Pursuant to Alleghany's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, the Board is divided into three separate classes of directors, which are required to be as nearly equal in number as practicable. At each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, one class of directors is elected to a term of three years. Currently, there are three standing committees of the Board, namely the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee. Additional information regarding these committees is set out on pages 16 to 18. 
The Board currently consists of nine directors. At a meeting of the Board on January 15, 2019, the Board increased its size from eight to nine directors and elected Lauren M. Tyler to fill the vacancy created by such increase in size. Ms. Tyler was elected for a term due to expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The directors nominated by the Board for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting to the class of 2022 are Karen Brenner, John G. Foos and Lauren M. Tyler. Each of the nominees is a current member of the Board and was recommended to the Board for nomination by the Nominating and Governance Committee. Mr. Foos and Ms. Brenner were last elected by stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 22, 2016. 
As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board "currently believes that it is desirable over time to have a Board of between eight and ten members (allowing that a larger or smaller number may be necessary or advisable in periods of transition or other particular circumstances)." In March 2012, upon the closing of Alleghany's acquisition of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc., or "TransRe," three former members of the board of directors of TransRe joined the Alleghany Board, resulting in a 14-person Board. Through 2018, Alleghany intentionally allowed the Board to decrease in size through the mandatory and elective retirements of six Board members, resulting in an eight-member Board at 2018 year-end. 
Cognizant of upcoming mandatory retirements, the Board in 2018 evaluated potential new Board members, as well as the characteristics desired in such potential Board members. In this regard, the Board sought candidates with diverse business and professional backgrounds and outstanding integrity and judgment, and such other skills and experience as would enhance the Board's ability to best serve Alleghany's interests. In addition, the Board specifically considered diversity as one of many factors in its evaluation. As discussed above, the Board's evaluation culminated in the appointment of Ms. Tyler to the Board in January 2019, and she is standing for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
The following charts illustrate the characteristics of our incumbent directors, including independence, diversity, age and tenure. 
-13- 
Director Independence 
Pursuant to the NYSE's listing standards, Alleghany is required to have a majority of independent directors, and no director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Alleghany. The Board has determined that none of the directors who served during any part of 2018, except Weston M. Hicks, our President and chief executive officer, has any material relationship with Alleghany other than in their capacities as members of the Board and committees thereof, and thus all of such directors, except Weston M. Hicks, are independent directors of Alleghany. With the January 2019 election of Lauren M. Tyler, whom the Board affirmatively determined has no material relationship with Alleghany, eight of Alleghany's nine current directors are independent directors. All of the director nominees are independent. Assuming that all of Ms. Brenner, Mr. Foos and Ms. Tyler are elected, eight of nine directors will be independent. 
Board Leadership 
Currently, the position of Chairman of the Board, or the "Chairman," and the position of President and chief executive officer are separate. It is the policy of the Board that the Chairman should not be an Alleghany officer. The current Chairman is an independent director. Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the duties of the Chairman include providing leadership to the Board in managing the business of the Board and ensuring that there is an effective structure for the operation of the Board and its committees. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate given the composition of the Board and management, the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the tenure of a majority of the Board members. 
Board Meetings 
We have strong director engagement on our Board. The Board held eight meetings in 2018. Each director who was a director during 2018 attended at least 95% of the meetings of the Board and committees of the Board on which he or she served in 2018, with seven of such directors attending 100% of the Board and committee meetings. Executive sessions for independent directors are held at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Chairman, who is currently an independent director, presides at these executive sessions. Alleghany does not have a policy with regard to attendance by directors at annual meetings of stockholders. Two directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Board Evaluation 
The Board believes that an effective director evaluation process allows it to gain insights into the effectiveness of the Board, its committees and its individual members, with the goal of continually enhancing Board performance. In this regard, each year the Board and each of its committees conducts an evaluation of their respective performance, effectiveness and fulfillment of fiduciary duties. The evaluation process is overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee and is reviewed annually to determine whether it is designed effectively and assures that appropriate feedback is being sought and reviewed. Historically, the Board evaluation was done on an overall basis through completion of a written questionnaire by each director on an anonymous basis to encourage candid feedback, supplemented by individual director interviews with the Chairman. 
In 2018, the Board determined to enhance the evaluation process by adding an individual director evaluation component, along with the completion of a director skills matrix. In this regard, the Nominating and Governance Committee approved evaluation questions which were to be considered by each director with respect to himself or herself, as well as each other director, along with a skills matrix questionnaire to be completed by each director. The Chairman of the Board, using the evaluation questions as a guide, then solicited a self-evaluation from each director, as well as an evaluation of each other director. The Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee solicited from each director an evaluation of the Chairman of the Board. At the conclusion of such process, the Chairman of the Board discussed with each director the results of his or her individual evaluation,

 and the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee discussed such matters with the Chairman of the Board. The results of the written overall Board and committee evaluations were reported to and reviewed by the full Board. In general, based upon its most recent evaluation, the Board and each committee were satisfied with their respective performance and considered themselves to be operating effectively. 
Chief Executive Officer and Senior Management Succession Planning 
A key responsibility of our chief executive officer and Board in the area of risk management is ensuring that an effective process is in place to provide continuity of leadership over the long term. At least once each year, our Board conducts a review of chief executive officer and senior management succession planning. During this review, the chief executive officer provides the Board with recommendations on, and evaluations of, potential chief executive officer and senior management successors, succession timing for those positions, and development plans for the potential successors. Our Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our chief executive officer, including the qualifications, experience and development priorities for these individuals. Further, our Board periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management's qualifications, tenure and experience. 
Our Board, in coordination with our Nominating and Governance Committee, also establishes steps to address emergency chief executive officer and senior management succession planning in extraordinary circumstances. Our emergency chief executive officer succession planning is intended to enable us to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting from a major catastrophe, by continuing our operations and minimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our business and operations. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees risk management directly and through its committees. Alleghany management regularly reports to the Board and, as appropriate, to its committees on management's risk activities, Alleghany's exposure and risk assessments. Enterprise risk management is a standing agenda item at each Board meeting and the chief risk officer, other Alleghany management and the Board discuss existing and emerging risks, controls and procedures, risk assessments and initiatives at such meetings. Each year, at the Board's January meeting, the Board receives a formal report on enterprise risk management from Alleghany's chief risk officer and, at the same meeting, considers Alleghany's three-year financial projections and the evaluation of the President and chief executive officer, allowing the Board to consider risk and risk management in the context of Alleghany's strategic plan and management's performance. Each year, at the Audit Committee's June meeting, it receives a formal report on enterprise risk management from Alleghany's chief risk officer and a formal report on legal compliance and ethics from Alleghany's chief compliance officer, which are also copied to the Board, and the chief risk officer and chief compliance officer subsequently report thereon to the Board. The Board receives updates on material developments with respect to risk management and legal compliance and ethics matters at its other regularly scheduled meetings. 
The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of Alleghany's financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, performance and independence of independent auditors and the performance of internal audit and internal controls over financial reporting, all of which contribute to risk oversight. The Nominating and Governance Committee ensures the development of appropriate corporate governance and oversees the evaluation of the Board and management. The Compensation Committee regularly monitors compensation policies, practices and outstanding awards to determine whether Alleghany's risk management and incentive objectives are being met with respect to group-wide employee incentives. The Board believes that risk oversight is a responsibility of the entire Board, and it does not look to any individual director or committee to lead it in discharging this responsibility.

Directors' Nominations and Qualifications 
The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies and recommends candidates for election to the Board, consistent with general criteria approved by the Board. The Board has not approved any specific criteria that must be met by each director nominee nor established a procedure for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. The Board believes that establishing such criteria is best left to an evaluation of Alleghany's needs at the time that a nomination is considered. The Board generally seeks members with diverse business and professional backgrounds and outstanding integrity and judgment, and such other skills and experience as will enhance the Board's ability to best serve Alleghany's interests. As a general matter, the Nominating and Governance Committee does consider diversity in identifying and evaluating possible nominees for director. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will receive at any time and will consider from time to time suggestions from stockholders regarding proposed director candidates. In this regard, a stockholder may submit a recommendation regarding a proposed director nominee in writing to the Nominating and Governance Committee in care of the Secretary of Alleghany at Alleghany's principal executive offices. Any such persons recommended by a stockholder will be evaluated in the same manner as persons identified by the Nominating and Governance Committee. 
A director is required to notify the Nominating and Governance Committee when a director's principal occupation or business association changes substantially. The Nominating and Governance Committee will 
-18- 
 consider whether any such change may materially interfere with the director's service as a director of Alleghany and make a recommendation to the Board in this regard. 
During 2018, at the request of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee undertook a process to identify a new director. The Nominating and Governance Committee determined that it would seek to identify a candidate who would have complementary business experience and would enhance board diversity. The Nominating and Governance Committee solicited directors to determine criteria for a prospective director and engaged Spencer Stuart, a nationally recognized search firm, to assist the Nominating and Governance Committee in identifying and evaluating potential nominees, including those potential nominees proposed by the directors. Spencer Stuart provided background information to the Nominating and Governance Committee regarding potential candidates meeting its search criteria and regularly communicated with the Nominating and Governance Committee to discuss such potential candidates. After review and discussion, the Nominating and Governance Committee and Spencer Stuart identified potential nominees to be interviewed. The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reported to the Board regarding the search's progress. The leading candidates were then interviewed by the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee, Jefferson W. Kirby, Chairman of the Board, and Weston M. Hicks, Alleghany's President and chief executive officer. At its meeting on November 19, 2018, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined to recommend to the Board that Ms. Lauren M. Tyler, a potential nominee who met the criteria outlined by the Board, was qualified to join the Board and that she should meet with directors at the Board's meeting the following day and, subject to the Board's concurrence, Ms. Tyler should be elected to the Board at its January 15, 2019 meeting. The Board met with Ms. Tyler at its meeting on November 20, 2018, and Ms. Tyler was elected as a director by the Board at its January 15, 2019 meeting, to serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Communications with Directors 
Interested parties may communicate directly with any individual director, the independent directors as a group or the Board as a whole by mailing such communication to the Secretary of Alleghany at Alleghany's principal executive offices. Any such communications will be delivered unopened: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if addressed to a specific director, to such director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if addressed to the independent directors, to the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee who will  report thereon to the independent directors; or

Stockholder Engagement 
Alleghany is committed to the interests of its stockholders and recognizes that communicating with stockholders on a regular basis is a critical part of this commitment. In this regard, Alleghany actively engages with its stockholders in order to understand fully their viewpoints concerning Alleghany and to help stockholders better understand Alleghany's strategy and performance. Management regularly engages with investors by participating in industry conferences, and also meets in person and by telephone with stockholders at other times throughout the year to solicit input and answer questions. Management also communicates to stockholders the Board's willingness to meet with them upon request and shares stockholder viewpoints with the Board. We believe our regular engagement with stockholders has been productive and provides an open exchange of ideas and perspectives for both Alleghany and its stockholders. Although we are open to meeting with all Alleghany stockholders, in 2018, we met with non-affiliated stockholders who held shares representing approximately 53% of Alleghany's shares of common stock held by non-affiliates. 
Director Retirement Policy 
Alleghany's retirement policy for directors provides that a director must retire from the Board at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders following his or her 75th birthday. 
-19- 
Codes of Ethics 
Alleghany has adopted an Employee Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all employees of Alleghany and its subsidiaries, a Financial Personnel Code of Ethics for its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer and all other officers in its Finance Department, a Director Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for members of the Board, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Our Business Partners for third parties with whom we do business, and the Corporate Governance Guidelines. A copy of each of these documents is available on Alleghany's website at www.alleghany.com or may be obtained, without charge, upon written request to the Secretary of Alleghany at Alleghany's principal executive offices. Alleghany will disclose on its website any substantive amendments to its codes of ethics and any waivers from the provisions of its codes of ethics made with respect to its chief executive officer, chief financial officer or chief accounting officer (or persons performing similar functions), as well as with respect to any other executive officer or any director of Alleghany. 
Majority Election of Directors 
The By-Laws provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors for uncontested elections. In connection with such provision of the By-Laws, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director nominee, as a condition of his or her nomination, shall tender to the Board at the time of nomination an irrevocable resignation effective if such nominee fails to receive the majority vote required by the By-Laws and the Board determines to accept such resignation. In the event that a director nominee fails to receive the requisite majority vote, the Nominating and Governance Committee will evaluate such resignation in light of Alleghany's best interests and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether it should accept the resignation. In making its recommendation, the Nominating and Governance Committee may consider any factors it deems relevant, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director's qualifications;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director's past and expected future contributions to Alleghany;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall composition of the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause Alleghany to fail to meet any applicable rule or  regulation, including the NYSE's listing standards and federal securities laws.  
[END TABLE]
The Board, by vote of independent directors other than the director whose resignation is being evaluated, will act on the tendered resignation and will publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Directors are expected to achieve ownership of common stock, or restricted stock units, having an aggregate value (based upon the higher of market value or book value) equal to at least five times the annual board retainer within five years of election to the Board, and to maintain such a level thereafter. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
Alleghany maintains a policy on insider trading and compliance that prohibits directors from directly or indirectly purchasing or using financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Alleghany securities that they own. In addition, under such policy, directors are prohibited from pledging Alleghany securities as collateral. 
-20- 
Related Party Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy, or "the Policy." Pursuant to the Policy, all related party transactions must be approved in advance by the Board. Under the Policy, a related party transaction means any transaction, other than compensation for services as an officer or director authorized and approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board, in which Alleghany or any of its subsidiaries is a participant and in which any of the following persons has or will have a direct or indirect material interest: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any director or officer of Alleghany; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any immediate family member of such director or officer, which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent,  spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director or officer.  
[END TABLE]
A person who has a position or relationship with a firm, corporation or other entity may be deemed to have an indirect interest in any transaction in which that entity engages. However, a person is not deemed to have an interest if such interest arises only from such person's position as a director of another corporation and/or such person's direct and indirect ownership of less than 10% of the equity of such firm, corporation or other entity. 
Under the Policy, all newly proposed related party transactions are referred to the Nominating and Governance Committee for review and consideration of its recommendation to the Board. Following this review, the related party transaction and the Nominating and Governance Committee's analysis and recommendations are presented to the full Board (other than any directors interested in the transaction) for approval. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews existing related party transactions annually, with the goals of ensuring that such transactions are being pursued in accordance with all of the understandings and commitments made at the time they were approved, ensuring that payments being made with respect to such transactions are appropriately reviewed and documented, and reaffirming that such transactions remain in the best interests of Alleghany. The Nominating and Governance Committee reports any such findings to the Board. 
As initially disclosed in the proxy statement prepared for the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Zachary A. Hicks, a son of Weston M. Hicks, Alleghany's President and chief executive officer, commenced employment with TransRe as an underwriter in March 2017. Zachary Hicks's 2018 aggregate compensation was $125,365 and was established in accordance with TransRe's employment and compensation practices applicable to employees with equivalent qualifications, experience, and responsibilities. Zachary Hicks is also eligible to participate in TransRe's employee benefit programs on the same basis as other eligible employees. Mr. Hicks did not participate in TransRe's compensation decisions relating to Zachary Hicks.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Alleghany has determined that, except as set forth below, no person who at any time during 2018 was a director, officer or beneficial owner of more than 10% of common stock failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the "Exchange Act," during 2017. This determination is based solely upon Alleghany's review of Forms 3, 4 and 5, and written representations that no Form 5 was required, which such persons submitted to Alleghany during or with respect to 2018. In February 2018, the Board declared a special dividend of $10.00 per share for stockholders of record on March 5, 2018. Under the 2005 Directors' Plan, 2010 Directors' Plan and 2015 Directors' Plan, when Alleghany pays a cash dividend on its common stock, each director holding restricted stock units, or "RSUs," awarded under such plans is credited with a corresponding dividend on his or her RSUs in the form of additional RSUs. Due to inadvertent administrative oversight, the Form 4 required to be filed for each non-employee director credited with a dividend payment on his or her RSUs in the form of additional RSUs was not filed within two business days of the date of the dividend payment. Such Forms 4 were filed on May 23, 2018.

Karen Brenner, John G. Foos and Lauren M. Tyler have been nominated by the Board for election as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting, each to serve for a term of three years, subject to Alleghany's director retirement policy, until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. Each of the nominees is a current member of the Board and was recommended to the Board for nomination by the Nominating and Governance Committee. Ms. Brenner and Mr. Foos were last elected by stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 22, 2016. At a Board meeting on January 15, 2019, the Board increased its size from eight to nine directors and elected Lauren M. Tyler to fill the vacancy created by such increase in size. Ms. Tyler was elected for a term to expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Information about Voting 
Proxies received from Alleghany stockholders of record will be voted for the election of the three nominees named above as Alleghany directors unless such stockholders indicate otherwise. If any of the foregoing nominees is unable to serve for any reason, which is not anticipated, the shares represented by proxy may be voted for such other person or persons as may be determined by the holders of such proxy unless stockholders indicate otherwise. A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board if such nominee receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the election of such nominee. A majority of votes cast means the number of votes cast "for" a nominee's election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes (see pages 10 and 11) do not count as votes cast "for" or "against" the nominee's election, but will be counted as present at the meeting for quorum purposes.

Stock Awards 
Pursuant to the 2015 Directors' Plan, each year as of the first business day following an annual meeting of stockholders, each individual who was elected or continues to serve as a member of the Board and who is not an employee of Alleghany or any of its subsidiaries receives, at the individual director's election, either a number of shares of restricted common stock or restricted stock units (each equivalent to one share of common stock) equal to $140,000 divided by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock on the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the grant date as reported by the NYSE. Such shares of restricted common stock or restricted stock units, as the case may be, are subject to potential forfeiture until the first annual meeting of stockholders following the date of grant and are subject to restrictions upon transfer until the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
On April 30, 2018, each eligible director received either 234 shares of restricted common stock or 234 restricted stock units, reflecting such number of shares or restricted stock units equal to $140,000 divided by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock on the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the grant date as reported by the NYSE. Each director is permitted to defer payment of the restricted stock units, and all whole restricted stock units will be paid in the form of whole shares of common stock. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES TO THE BOARD SET FORTH IN THIS PROPOSAL. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY A CONTRARY VOTE. EACH NOMINEE SHALL BE ELECTED BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF SUCH NOMINEE. A MAJORITY OF VOTES CAST MEANS THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST "FOR" A NOMINEE'S ELECTION MUST EXCEED THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST "AGAINST" THE NOMINEE'S ELECTION.

PROPOSAL 2. RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL 2019 
The Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP, or "E&Y," as Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Although ratification by stockholders is not a prerequisite to the ability of the Audit Committee to select E&Y as Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that such ratification is desirable. If stockholders do not ratify the selection of E&Y, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of E&Y. The Audit Committee may, however, select E&Y notwithstanding the failure of stockholders to ratify its selection. Alleghany expects that representatives of E&Y will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
2018 and 2017 Fees 
The following table summarizes the fees billed for professional audit services rendered by E&Y for the audit of Alleghany's annual consolidated financial statements for 2018 and 2017 and fees for other services rendered by E&Y for 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 6,242,191      $ 5,633,920   
 Audit-Related Fees      10,000        39,000   
 Tax Fees      137,500        142,500   
 All Other Fees      —        —   
 Total    $ 6,389,691      $ 5,815,420   
[END TABLE]
The amounts shown for "Audit Fees" represent the aggregate fees for professional services E&Y rendered for the audit of Alleghany's annual consolidated financial statements for each of the last two fiscal years, the reviews of Alleghany's financial statements included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the services provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings during each of the last two fiscal years. "Audit Fees" also include fees for professional services E&Y rendered for the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The amounts shown for "Audit-Related Fees" represent the fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for assurance and related services, including regulatory exams, that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Alleghany's financial statements and that are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include consents and procedures for registration statements and responses to regulatory requests. The amounts for "Tax Fees" represent fees E&Y incurred with respect to tax compliance work related to its review of Alleghany's federal income tax return, as well as the services provided in 2017 in connection with the tax compliance work related to Alleghany Capital's acquisition of a majority interest in WWSC Holdings, LLC. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Audit and permissible non-audit services that Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm may provide to Alleghany must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or, between meetings of the Audit Committee, by its Chairman pursuant to authority delegated to him by the Audit Committee. The Chairman reports all pre-approval decisions made by him at the next meeting of the Audit Committee, and he has undertaken to confer with the Audit Committee to the extent that any engagement for which his pre-approval is sought is expected to generate fees for the independent registered public accounting firm in excess of $100,000. When considering the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers, among other matters, whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm to Alleghany is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. All audit and permissible non-audit services rendered in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved pursuant to these procedures.

THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS A ROUTINE PROPOSAL ON WHICH A BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE IS GENERALLY EMPOWERED TO VOTE IN THE ABSENCE OF VOTING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE BENEFICIAL OWNER, SO BROKER NON-VOTES ARE UNLIKELY TO RESULT FROM THIS PROPOSAL.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee is currently composed of the four independent directors whose names appear at the end of this report. Management is responsible for Alleghany's internal controls and the financial reporting process. Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of Alleghany's annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes and the activities of Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee members are not acting as professional accountants or auditors, and their responsibilities are not intended to duplicate or certify the activities of management and the independent registered public accounting firm or to certify the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm under applicable rules. 
For fiscal 2018, Ernst & Young LLP acted as Alleghany's independent registered public accounting firm. In this context, the Audit Committee has met to review and discuss Alleghany's audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the fiscal year then ended, including Alleghany's specific disclosure under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and critical accounting estimates, with management and Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees," issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the "PCAOB." Ernst & Young LLP reported to the Audit Committee regarding the critical accounting estimates and practices and the estimates and assumptions used by management in the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the fiscal year then ended, all alternative treatments of financial information within generally accepted accounting principles that have been discussed with management, the ramifications of use of such alternative treatments and the treatment preferred by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Ernst & Young LLP provided a report to the Audit Committee describing Ernst & Young LLP's internal quality-control procedures and related matters. Ernst & Young LLP also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst & Young LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence. When considering Ernst Young LLP's independence, the Audit Committee considered, among other matters, whether Ernst & Young LLP's provision of non-audit services to Alleghany is compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. All audit and permissible non-audit services in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved pursuant to these procedures. 
Based on the reviews and discussions with management and Ernst & Young LLP referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the fiscal year then ended be included in Alleghany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year.

PROPOSAL 3. ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the 2018 compensation we paid to the executive officers who are named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 59, also referred to as our "Named Executive Officers." For 2018, Weston M. Hicks, Joseph P. Brandon, Christopher K. Dalrymple, and John L. Sennott, Jr. were our Named Executive Officers. 
Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 39 of this Proxy Statement as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables, notes and narrative appearing on pages 59 through 72 of this Proxy Statement, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2018. 
For a discussion of the results of past advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the Compensation Committee's response to such results, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis —Compensation Committee Process — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation" on page 49. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that Alleghany's 2018 executive compensation program was designed appropriately and ensured that management's interests were aligned with the interests of Alleghany stockholders. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote in favor of the following advisory resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Alleghany Corporation ("Alleghany") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Alleghany's named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative set forth in the proxy statement for Alleghany's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Although this advisory vote, commonly referred to as "say-on-pay," is not binding on Alleghany, the Compensation Committee or the Board, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions about our executive compensation program. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY A CONTRARY VOTE. THIS PROPOSAL SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST ON THIS PROPOSAL. ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THIS VOTE.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Dear Alleghany Stockholder, 
Due to SEC proxy rules and regulations, most of the compensation information contained in the Summary Compensation Table on page 59 was set back in January of 2018, and the analysis and determinations regarding such information also look backwards to that time. Before turning to that historical information, we thought it would be helpful to first discuss Alleghany's overall corporate structure and philosophy, how that philosophy and structure inform our executive compensation program and the results of a review we did during 2018 of our compensation process and program. The results of this review informed decisions we made with respect to compensation for 2019. 
On a group-wide basis, Alleghany has over 9,000 employees. Yet at the parent-level, Alleghany is managed by a small group of professionals consisting of four executive officers and 15 officers. This small team is responsible for overseeing, not operating, Alleghany's subsidiaries; making capital allocation decisions; managing Alleghany's group-wide investment portfolios; and managing financial reporting, legal and compliance functions and other public company obligations. With respect to our subsidiaries, the parent-company does not run them on a day-to-day basis — their subsidiary executive teams do. Instead, the parent company's small professional team provides our subsidiaries with strategic guidance, sets risk parameters, and ensures that management incentives are appropriate. 
Alleghany's extensive history and focus on its long-term legacy inform our culture, strategy and compensation. From a culture perspective, although we must offer competitive compensation, we do not seek to compete for executive talent solely on the basis of compensation. We also compete by offering a unique professional opportunity to work in a high integrity environment where the focus is on building stockholder value over the very long term. Our collaborative, team-oriented culture is a key driver of retention. Our retention efforts, which include compensation aspects, result in parent-level employees with long tenures, which fits with our long-term financial results orientation. 
From a strategic perspective, Alleghany's long-term value proposition is to make a reasonable return in good times and preserve capital in bad times. We have an aversion to doing things which, although they may have the potential for significant gain, also bring with them greater chance of a permanent loss of capital. With that in mind, our financial objective in the current economic environment is to grow our common stockholders' equity per share at a rate of 7-10% over the long term without employing excessive amounts of financial leverage and without taking imprudent risks. 
Our compensation program is designed to provide compensation to the parent company professional team that is aligned with the above objective. Alleghany's executives are primarily compensated through annual cash compensation, consisting of salary and an annual incentive opportunity, and a long-term plan which provides annual awards of performance shares and restricted stock units. With respect to annual incentive opportunities, we generally think of annual incentive compensation as variable pay linked to the achievement of strategic and operational objectives by management during the year and not "incentive" pay intended to send strong messages about performance differences based on a rigid formulaic approach. Our annual incentive awards are capped and not the most meaningful part of management compensation. After completing our 2018 review and considering a number of alternative approaches, we concluded that, in Alleghany's current configuration, the existing structure of our annual incentive compensation program, with its funding occurring only upon generation of positive earnings, its capped upside, and our ability to adjust payouts in light of our evaluation of Alleghany performance and individual contributions, remains the optimal approach and is in the best interests of Alleghany and its stockholders. 
With respect to long-term incentive compensation, executive awards are made primarily in the form of performance shares, and these awards comprise a significant amount of our executive compensation. 
-39- 
 Since 2003, performance share payouts have been based on management's ability to grow common stockholders' equity per share relative to Alleghany's cost of equity capital, an approach we believe aligns executive compensation with the returns provided to Alleghany's long-term owners. If Alleghany suffers a decline in common stockholders' equity per share in any one year, like it did in 2018, it (i) negatively impacts all outstanding performance share awards, (ii) reduces or eliminates the number of performance shares that are paid out, and (iii) because the stock price is likely to be lower than it would have been without a decline in common stockholders' equity in that one year, the dollar value of any shares earned is reduced even further. In this regard, we note that for the performance share award period 2015-2018 which just ended, management did not achieve the threshold performance necessary for any payout of performance shares, which we believe is evidence that they are held fully accountable for Alleghany's longer-term financial results. 
With respect to our focus on common stockholders' equity per share as the metric for performance share awards, after concluding our 2018 review, we continue to believe that this metric is the most appropriate yardstick against which management's performance should be measured. Over long periods of time (a decade or more), Alleghany's stock price has tended to grow at the same rate as the growth rate of its common stockholders' equity per share. Over shorter time-periods, however, the two can move in very different directions, due to general market sentiment and changes in investor expectations about the future relative growth rate of Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share compared to other alternatives in the stock market. Although we provide a substantial percentage of compensation to our executive officers through stock-based vehicles, we do not believe in linking the number of performance shares earned to stock price performance, or reducing the number of performance shares earned in the event that the stock price performance is negative. 
We see three primary issues with using stock price as a specific performance metric in incentive plans. First, a company's stock price may move up or down over short periods of time (less than five years) due to cyclical trends in its industry, changes in investor preferences, or other reasons that are unrelated to a company's performance. Second, a company's risk profile may not be adequately tested over short periods of time. If a stockholder invests in a company for long-term growth in capital, it is imperative that the company not suffer a permanent loss. Management in an insurance or reinsurance holding company can produce what may appear to be good short-term results, either by encouraging premium growth through more aggressive pricing or taking more "tail risk" in its operations. The negative effects of such actions may not show up over short periods of time, but time is the enemy of the imprudent risk taker. Eventually companies are tested, and it is only then that a stockholder finds out how well management has controlled risk. Third, extreme stock market moves can produce perverse results, even if measured on a relative basis. A stock market bubble can reward management when an increasing share price overcomes the impact of poor financial performance. Similarly, a stock market crash can penalize management when excellent financial performance is masked by share price declines unrelated to the company. Relative performance can be impacted by short-term volatility more so than steady, long-term results. 
In sum, we believe that Alleghany's approach to holding company executive compensation is timeless and effective. It is designed to incentivize performance over the long-term and link executives' interests with those of Alleghany's long-term stockholders. We believe that the program, although we may refine it in the future as circumstances or needs warrant, is effective in achieving our strategic objectives and aligns management's interests with those of all of Alleghany's stockholders.

Review of Executive Compensation Process and Program in 2018 
After passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the "TCJA," and due to certain internal considerations, the Compensation Committee determined to conduct a review of the primary components of Alleghany's parent-level compensation program to ensure that it continued to support the objectives and principles discussed above on pages 39 and 40. As part of this, the Compensation Committee considered changes to annual incentive compensation, long-term incentive compensation, and the peer companies we reference below when thinking about compensation and performance. Results of this review are set out in further detail below. 
As part of its review, in June 2018, after a competitive process, the Compensation Committee selected Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC, or "Semler Brossy," as its new compensation consultant. In making this selection, the Compensation Committee reviewed and assessed Semler Brossy's independence as a firm and the individuals providing advice to the Compensation Committee and determined that the firm and its relevant individual advisors were independent. 
At the direction of the Compensation Committee, Semler Brossy reviewed Alleghany's executive compensation program and process, including by meeting with the Compensation Committee and members of management. At the Compensation Committee's September 2018 meeting, Semler Brossy summarized its initial findings, reporting that it did not believe there was a need to make significant changes to Alleghany's existing compensation program. However, Semler Brossy suggested a few refinements for consideration to ensure that the compensation program continued to align with Alleghany's strategy, culture and range of appropriate competitive practices. The Compensation Committee asked that Semler Brossy work with management during the remainder of 2018 to consider such possible refinements, including peer group development, design of the annual incentive plan and objectives thereof, the structure of Alleghany's long-term incentive plan and metrics thereof and various program governance and related items. After the completion of such work, the Compensation Committee determined the following with respect to certain aspects of Alleghany's executive compensation program. 
TCJA and Performance-Linked Pay 
Despite the elimination of tax benefits for performance-based pay under the TCJA, the Compensation Committee determined that linking a substantial portion of executive annual compensation to performance continued to be appropriate and in the best interests of Alleghany and its stockholders. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
No change was made to the current structure of executive annual incentive awards under the 2015 Management Incentive Plan, or the "2015 MIP." Although the Compensation Committee analyzed and discussed various changes, including adding an explicit quantitative metric to annual performance goals for executives, the Compensation Committee ultimately determined, as discussed on page 39, that the current approach to annual incentive compensation was appropriate at this time and in the best interests of Alleghany and its stockholders. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan     
After reviewing and discussing analyses at its 2018 meetings and January 2019 meeting, the Compensation Committee determined that Alleghany's long-term incentive program was generally well-structured and suited to support the strategic objective of growing common stockholders' equity per share 7-10% over the long-term without taking imprudent risks. The Compensation Committee did determine to refine its approach to long-term incentives with the following revisions for 2019 awards: 
Form of Long-Term Incentive Awards for Mr. Hicks and Mr. Brandon. Historically, Mr. Hicks's and Mr. Brandon's long-term incentive opportunities were denominated solely in performance shares, the payout of 
-41- 
 which is based on achievement of the specified performance goal of growth in common stockholders' equity per share, while such opportunities for Mr. Sennott and Mr. Dalrymple were divided two-thirds in performance shares and one-third in time-based restricted stock units which cliff-vest four years from the date of grant. For 2019, Mr. Hicks's and Mr. Brandon's long-term incentive opportunities have been divided 75% in the form of performance shares and 25% in the form of restricted stock units. This change was made in order to help further balance risk in our long-term incentive program and maintain a focus on rewarding longer-term performance. In making this decision, the Compensation Committee also considered factors including peer group and general industry market practice, as well as grant practices for other members of Alleghany management. 
Performance Share Award Period. Historically, payouts of performance shares awards were based solely on the growth in common stockholders' equity per share over a single four-year performance period. The Compensation Committee determined to adjust the awards beginning in 2019 (outstanding awards will not be adjusted) so that performance periods were staggered such that 25% will be paid out based on a three-year performance period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020), 50% will be paid out based on a four-year performance period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021) and 25% will be paid out based on a five-year performance period (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022). This staggered payout schedule avoids the "cliff effect" at the end of any particular four-year award period which can, in certain circumstances, turn a long-term plan into a short-term plan and incent unwanted behavior. 
Peer Group 
As part of its review of the Company's executive compensation program, Semler Brossy also developed a peer group of companies that might compete with us for executive talent to be used for market comparison purposes. Although we do not seek to set our executive compensation primarily based on any benchmarks or peer group, we believe that information regarding pay levels and practices at other companies is nevertheless useful in two respects. First, we recognize that our compensation levels and practices must be competitive in the marketplace. Second, independent marketplace information is one of the many factors that we consider in assessing the reasonableness of compensation. In this regard, in considering compensation for the Named Executive Officers for 2019, the Compensation Committee considered comparative market data from the following peer companies identified by Semler Brossy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Arch Capital Group Ltd.   Markel Corporation   The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. 
 Axis Capital Holdings Limited   Old Republic International Corporation       Validus Holdings Ltd. 
 Cincinnati Financial Corporation       Reinsurance Group of America, Inc.   XL Group Ltd. 
 CNA Financial Corporation   RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.   White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. 
 Everest Re Group, Ltd.   The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc.   W.R. Berkley Corporation 
[END TABLE]
This peer group was developed to reflect publicly traded companies that generally as a group (i) approximate our scope of business and that of our subsidiaries, including revenue and market capitalization, (ii) are similar to us in the importance to their business of capital allocation, investments and risk management, (iii) compete with us for a comparable pool of executive talent, and (iv) reflect our global presence. The peer companies identified by Semler Brossy were the same as those identified by the Compensation Committee's former compensation consultant other than replacing Progressive Corporation and Erie Indemnity Company with The Hanover Insurance Group and The Hartford Financial Services Group.

Alleghany Long-Term Performance 
We believe that Alleghany's performance is best measured over the long term, and that long-term growth in common stockholders' equity per share is the best metric for evaluating such performance. In this regard, the table below shows the annual, and three- and ten-year average rolling, annualized growth in our common stockholders' equity per share, adjusted for a 2018 cash dividend and historical stock dividends, during the five-year period from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2018:

As can be seen in the table above, Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share has compounded over the three- and ten-year periods in the range of Alleghany's stated strategic objective of 7-10% annual growth in common stockholders' equity per share, although it trailed that objective in 2018 and the three-year periods ending in 2017 and 2018 primarily due to a decline in the market value of Alleghany's equity portfolio in December 2018 and significant catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2018. 
-45- 
The chart below summarizes Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share growth and stock price performance over the ten-year period from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2018, compared with the S&P 500, with all values indexed to December 31, 2008. During this ten-year period, Alleghany's common stockholders' equity per share increased at a compound annual rate of 7.2% (adjusted for dividends), compared with a compound annual rate of return of 13.1% for the S&P 500, and the price of Alleghany common stock (adjusted for dividends) appreciated at a 9.1% compound annual rate of return. 
As indicated by the data presented in the chart above, Alleghany's growth in common stockholders' equity per share has been relatively consistent, with the exception of 2018 when it was negatively impacted by a decline in the market value of Alleghany's equity portfolio and significant catastrophe losses. The trading price of Alleghany's common stock has been more volatile, reflecting the volatility of the stock market in general. In Alleghany's view, growth in common stockholders' equity per share is a better measure of fundamental performance and value creation as compared to the more volatile trading price of Alleghany's common stock. As such, Alleghany focuses its executive compensation incentive program on building common stockholders' equity per share over time.

During the ten-year performance period set out in the graph on page 46, we believe that Mr. Hicks's compensation has been well-aligned with Alleghany's long-term performance as can be seen in the table below.

Compensation Committee Process 
Compensation Determination Timetable 
General Setting of Salary and Incentive Awards 
Salary adjustments for the coming year and new incentive awards are generally made annually by the Compensation Committee at its regularly scheduled January meeting or meetings. At its meetings in January 2018, the Compensation Committee determined 2018 salaries, 2018 annual incentive award opportunities and 2018-2021 long-term incentive awards for all of the Named Executive Officers. This meeting followed the January 2018 Board meeting, at which the Board reviewed and discussed: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an evaluation of preliminary 2017 financial results for Alleghany;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an evaluation of Mr. Hicks's 2017 performance and priorities for 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a report by Mr. Hicks on management succession and development throughout Alleghany;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the recommendation of Mr. Hicks regarding the individual performance of each Named Executive Officer; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alleghany's projections and plan for 2018 through 2020.  
[END TABLE]
Setting of Mr. Hicks's 2018 Compensation 
In determining Mr. Hicks's 2018 compensation, the Compensation Committee at its January 2018 meeting reviewed Mr. Hicks's 2017 performance and 2018 priorities, as well as all components of Mr. Hicks's 2017 compensation, including annual salary, annual cash incentive compensation in respect of 2017, outstanding performance share awards, values of previous awards of restricted stock and benefits under Alleghany's Deferred Compensation Plan, Alleghany's medical, long-term disability and other employee welfare plans and the freezing of the Retirement Plan at year-end 2013. After this review and the Compensation Committee's consideration of input from its compensation consultant at the time, Frederic W. Cook & Co. Inc., or "F.W. Cook," the Committee determined to increase Mr. Hicks's 2018: (i) salary to $1,030,000 from $1,000,000, (ii) target annual incentive opportunity to 200% from 190% of salary, and (iii) target long-term incentive opportunity for the 2018-2021 award period to 460% from 450% of salary. These increases in target opportunities reflect the Compensation Committee's consideration of internal comparability factors, its assessment of Mr. Hicks's superior performance over a long-term period, very positive 2017 results for Alleghany and its stockholders, and its emphasis on tying increases in Mr. Hicks's compensation substantially to performance-based components. 
Payouts of Awards in Respect of 2018 Performance 
The Compensation Committee generally determines the payout of awards for prior performance periods at a meeting in late February, upon the completion of the year-end audit of prior year financial statements. With respect to 2018, the Compensation Committee determined payouts to the Named Executive Officers, including Mr. Hicks, of 2018 annual incentive awards and 2015-2018 long-term incentive awards at its February 20, 2019 meeting. Annual incentive payout determinations were based on Board and Compensation Committee discussions and determinations regarding Alleghany's financial performance for 2018 and applicable award periods, an evaluation of Mr. Hicks's 2018 performance, and the recommendation of Mr. Hicks regarding the individual performance of the other Named Executive Officers. With respect to the 2015-2018 long-term incentive awards, no payouts were made as threshold performance was not achieved. 
Compensation Committee Advisors and Services 
The Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy as a compensation consultant commencing in June 2018 to assist the Compensation Committee in its review of executive and director compensation practices, 
-48- 
 including the competitiveness of Alleghany executive compensation, executive compensation program design matters, market trends and technical considerations. 
The nature and scope of services that Semler Brossy provides to the Compensation Committee include the following: competitive market compensation analyses; assistance with the redesign of any director or management compensation or benefit programs as necessary or requested; assistance with respect to analyzing the impact of regulatory and/or accounting developments on our compensation plans and programs; and preparation for and attendance at selected Compensation Committee meetings. Semler Brossy is also available to advise the Compensation Committee and management on various executive compensation matters involving our operating subsidiaries. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee reviews and approves all services provided by Semler Brossy and fees to be paid by Alleghany to Semler Brossy. As discussed on page 42, the Compensation Committee has been advised by Semler Brossy as to the compensation levels of other companies that might compete with us for executive talent. 
From January 2018 to June 2018, the Compensation Committee was advised by its compensation consultant, F.W. Cook. During this time, F.W. Cook assisted the Compensation Committee in its review of executive and director compensation practices, including the competitiveness of Alleghany executive compensation, executive compensation program design matters, market trends and technical considerations. The Compensation Committee reviewed and assessed F.W. Cook's independence as a firm and the individuals providing advice to the Compensation Committee and determined that the firm and the relevant individual advisors were independent. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Consistent with the Board's recommendation and the non-binding stockholder vote at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Alleghany holds a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation, commonly referred to as "say-on-pay," every year. The Compensation Committee monitors the results of Alleghany's "say-on-pay" proposal and related stockholder feedback when evaluating the effectiveness of Alleghany's compensation policies and disclosures, particularly in the event of a negative vote or significant change in the percentage of favorable votes with regard to such proposal. Alleghany also actively engages with its significant stockholders to gauge their opinions on a range of topics, including executive compensation. We view this as an important opportunity to develop broader relationships with key investors over the long term and to engage in open dialogue on compensation and governance related issues. 
At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in April 2018, we received strong support for our executive compensation program, with approximately 98% stockholder approval of our say-on-pay proposal. When setting compensation for 2019, the Compensation Committee considered both the level of voting support from our stockholders on our say-on-pay vote, as well as stockholder feedback and Semler Brossy's observations when evaluating our executive compensation plans and determined that no material changes to the Alleghany's executive compensation program were warranted. The Compensation Committee will continue to review the design of the executive compensation program in light of future "say-on-pay" votes, developments in executive compensation, and Alleghany's pay-for-performance philosophy to ensure that the executive compensation program continues to serve the best interests of Alleghany and its stockholders. 
Elements of 2018 Compensation 
The principal elements of compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers in respect of 2018 consisted of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salaries;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual cash incentive compensation;  
[END TABLE]
-49- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual grants of long-term equity-based incentives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual savings benefit equal to 15% of base salary.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, our Named Executive Officers receive a benefit, assuming the completion of five years of service with Alleghany, under the Retirement Plan, although such benefit was frozen in 2013. 
The percentage that these elements represent of the 2018 compensation for our chief executive officer and our other Named Executive Officers is reflected below. 
Set out below in more detail is a description and analysis of each of these elements of our compensation program. 
Salary 
We seek to pay salaries that are sufficiently competitive to attract and retain executive talent. The Compensation Committee generally makes salary adjustments annually, in consultation with its compensation consultant, based on salaries for the prior year, general inflation, individual performance and internal comparability considerations. The following actions were taken with respect to 2018 salaries for our Named Executive Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Mr. Hicks    $ 1,030,000              $ 1,000,000      3% increase reflecting 2017 contributions, continued emphasis on performance-linked compensation and first salary increase since 2011. 
 Mr. Brandon      875,000                850,000      3% increase reflecting 2017 contributions and continued emphasis on performance-linked compensation. 
 Mr. Dalrymple      690,000                670,000      3% increase reflecting 2017 contributions and continued emphasis on performance-linked compensation. 
 Mr. Sennott      690,000                670,000      3% increase reflecting 2017 contributions and continued emphasis on performance-linked compensation. 
[END TABLE]
-50- 
Annual Cash Incentive Compensation 
We generally pay annual cash incentives to our Named Executive Officers under the 2015 MIP. The intent of these annual cash incentive awards is to provide a pay-for-performance element for the achievement of Alleghany's shorter-term objectives. 
In making 2018 awards under the 2015 MIP, the Compensation Committee recognized that, given the nature of Alleghany's business and long-term approach, evaluating how Alleghany achieves shorter-term objectives can be a subjective process, but believed the subjectivity is mitigated by the fact that these 2018 annual cash incentive awards were subject to two meaningful limitations. First, no payout to any Named Executive Officer could exceed the amount of his maximum annual incentive opportunity set at the beginning of 2018, resulting in an approximate $3.1 million maximum award opportunity for Mr. Hicks and an aggregate maximum award opportunity of approximately $6.2 million for our Named Executive Officers as a group. Second, funding of the 2018 Incentive Pool Amount (as defined below) is limited to a specified level of earnings produced by management in 2018. To the extent the funding of the 2018 Incentive Pool Amount had been less than the aggregate maximum award amount of approximately $6.2 million for our Named Executive Officers as a group, a pro-rata reduction of individual award amounts would have occurred. To the extent that Alleghany had a loss for 2018, no payout would have been made under the 2015 MIP. In sum, payouts under the 2015 MIP for 2018 performance are the lesser of (i) the 2018 Incentive Pool Amount and (ii) the maximum opportunity for management (as may be reduced by the Compensation Committee for individual performance). 
Process 
The Compensation Committee makes annual incentive awards for the upcoming year and determines each Named Executive Officer's appropriate target amount in January of that year after evaluating projected earnings for the prior year. 2018 target annual incentive awards and maximum incentive opportunities were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       2018 Salary($)      Target Opportunity($/%)      Maximum Opportunity($)(1)   
       2018 Salary($)      Target Opportunity($/%)      Maximum Opportunity($)(1)   
 Mr. Hicks    $ 1,030,000      $ 2,060,000       (200%)      $ 3,090,000   
 Mr. Brandon      875,000        1,163,750       (133%)        1,750,000   
 Mr. Dalrymple      690,000        462,000       (67%)        690,000   
 Mr. Sennott      690,000        462,000       (67%)        690,000   
 Totals    $ 3,285,000        $4,147,750           $ 6,220,000   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The maximum opportunity percentage for each respective Named Executive Officer is approximately 150% of such  Named Executive Officer's target award.  
[END TABLE]
The differing target awards as a percentage of salary reflect the Compensation Committee's determinations of appropriate levels and mix of compensation components, taking into account varying levels of responsibility, internal comparability, the implicit impact of the various Named Executive Officer levels on the accomplishment of Alleghany's financial, strategic and operational objectives and competitive considerations. For 2018 annual incentive awards, the opportunities for each of our Named Executive Officers, expressed as a percentage of salary, were the same as those set forth above for 2017, except for Mr. Hicks whose opportunity at target was increased to 200% of salary, or $2,060,000, with a maximum opportunity of $3,090,000 reflecting the Compensation Committee's consideration of internal comparability factors, its assessment of Mr. Hicks's superior performance over a long-term period, very positive 2017 results for Alleghany and its stockholders, and its emphasis on tying increases in Mr. Hicks's compensation substantially to performance-based components. 
Payout of awards is tied to the achievement of a specified financial performance objective, subject to reduction in respect of Alleghany performance and/or individual performance. The financial performance objective is set in January, after evaluating projected earnings for 2018 and determining each Named Executive 
-51- 
 Officer's appropriate target opportunity amount. With respect to individual performance objectives, each of our Named Executive Officers submits individual objectives for the coming year, with Mr. Hicks submitting his to the Board and the other Named Executive Officers submitting their individual objectives to Mr. Hicks. These objectives are in addition to the core responsibilities of our Named Executive Officers. Status updates on the achievement of such individual objectives and performance of core responsibilities are given through the year by each Named Executive Officer, culminating in a final report made in advance of payout determinations made by the Board and Compensation Committee at the beginning of the following year. In this regard, Mr. Hicks provides a self-evaluation to the Board of his performance against objectives during the year and Messrs. Brandon, Dalrymple and Sennott provide Mr. Hicks with the same, which Mr. Hicks then reviews with the Compensation Committee. 
Financial Performance Objective 
The 2018 financial performance goal established by the Compensation Committee for annual incentive awards to our Named Executive Officers was based on a funding approach, which was capped at an amount equal to 3% of 2018 earnings before income taxes, as reported in Alleghany's audited financial statements, as adjusted, or the "2018 Incentive Pool Amount," to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• exclude effects of accounting changes, charges for goodwill or intangibles impairment (including other than  temporary impairment charges);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• exclude expenses incurred in connection with actual and potential acquisitions; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• deduct from 2018 earnings a rolling four-year (2014-2017) average of catastrophe losses at RSUI, our principal  insurance subsidiary, and TransRe, our principal reinsurance subsidiary, instead of actual 2018 catastrophe losses at RSUI and TransRe.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to catastrophe losses, RSUI's 2014-2017 catastrophe average, or the "RSUI CAT Average," was $85.2 million compared with 2018 actual catastrophe losses of $133.4 million, net of prior year development and reinsurance reinstatement premiums. TransRe's 2014-2017 catastrophe average, or the "TransRe CAT Average," was $166.5 million compared with 2018 actual catastrophe losses of $446.5 million, net of prior year development and reinsurance reinstatement premiums. The use of the RSUI CAT Average and TransRe CAT Average rather than the actual amount of their respective 2018 catastrophe losses was based upon the Compensation Committee's acknowledgement that RSUI and TransRe are significant writers of catastrophe exposed property (re)insurance and that management cannot predict the occurrence or severity of catastrophe losses in any particular year. Using a four-year average recognizes that catastrophe losses are a cost of doing business and accounts for them in a manner consistent with Alleghany's focus on long-term performance. In this regard, actual catastrophe losses impact funding calculations for annual incentive pools during the four-year averaging period in which they are included. A year in which Alleghany experiences significant catastrophe losses, such as it did during 2018, will impact MIP annual incentive pool funding for the subsequent four years, holding management fully accountable for such catastrophe losses.

Individual Performance Objectives 
In January 2018, Mr. Hicks provided the Board, and Messrs. Brandon, Dalrymple and Sennott provided Mr. Hicks, with their 2018 objectives that were in addition to performance of their core responsibilities. These core responsibilities and 2018 objectives for our Named Executive Officers included the following:

Payouts with respect to 2018 Performance 
Based on our 2018 financial results, the 2018 Incentive Pool Funding Amount was approximately $11.2 million, so that Messrs. Hicks, Brandon, Dalrymple and Sennott were eligible to receive maximum payout in February 2019 of their 2018 incentive opportunities, aggregating to approximately $6.2 million, under the 2015 MIP based on achievement of the financial performance goal, subject to reduction for individual performance. 
At its meeting on February 20, 2019, the Compensation Committee evaluated Alleghany's overall corporate performance and the individual performance of Mr. Hicks, and Mr. Hicks's recommendation regarding the individual performance of the other Named Executive Officers. With respect to Alleghany's operating performance and achievement of strategic objectives, the Compensation Committee noted the following positive factors, among others, during 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record earnings and a double-digit return on invested capital at Alleghany Capital, along with completion of  successful acquisition of Concord,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alleghany Capital's platform companies strengthened through several complementary, bolt-on acquisitions,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant outperformance of Alleghany benchmarks on equity portfolio, including the S&P 500 by 4.4%, and  slight positive return on fixed income portfolio in a period of mostly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Positive underwriting results at RSUI and CapSpecialty in 2018,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintenance of a strong financial position with low financial leverage and significant holding company liquidity,  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Returning value to stockholders through a special $10.00 per share cash dividend and $492 million of share  repurchases.  
[END TABLE]
These positive factors were partially offset by factors including an underwriting loss for 2018 at TransRe, primarily due to elevated catastrophe losses, and a 2018 fourth quarter impairment charge at Stranded Oil Resources Corporation. 
After consideration of these and other factors, the Compensation Committee determined to make a payout to Mr. Hicks of his 2018 annual incentive opportunity at $2,163,000, representing 105% of his target opportunity and 70% of his maximum opportunity, compared with a payment of his prior year annual incentive award at 112.5% of target and 75% of his maximum opportunity. Regarding individual performance of the other Named Executive Officers, Mr. Hicks's recommendations reflected the factors cited above, Mr. Hicks's assessment of superior performance with respect to their core responsibilities, and achievement of their 2018 objectives. Following the evaluations by Mr. Hicks of the other Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee authorized payouts of 2018 annual bonus opportunities at maximum to Messrs. Brandon, Dalrymple and Sennott under the 2015 MIP for an aggregate payout to them in the amount of approximately $3.1 million. 
Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Compensation 
In 2018, we made awards of long-term incentive compensation to our Named Executive Officers under the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the "2017 LTIP." Historically, long-term incentive awards have been made primarily in the form of performance shares and, in certain cases, shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units. Awards of performance shares under the 2017 LTIP are intended to provide a pay-for-performance component of compensation based upon the achievement of longer-term financial objectives focused on growth in book value per share. Awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the 2017 LTIP are intended to provide a retention component of compensation, the value of which is tied to the market price of our common stock. 
-54- 
Performance Shares 
For the 2018-2021 award period, the Compensation Committee based the number of performance shares awarded to each Named Executive Officer upon a percentage of such officer's 2018 salary (as determined by the Compensation Committee) divided by the average closing prices of common stock for the 30-day period prior to the mailing of material for the meeting of the Compensation Committee at which such awards were made. Such percentages of 2018 salary were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Mr. Hicks    $ 1,030,000        460              $ 4,738,000

The differing target awards as a percentage of salary reflect the Compensation Committee's determinations of appropriate levels and mix of compensation components, taking into account varying levels of responsibility, internal comparability, the implicit impact of the various Named Executive Officers on the accomplishment of Alleghany's financial, strategic and operational objectives, and competitive considerations. With respect to Mr. Hicks in particular, his 2018 performance share award reflected the Compensation Committee's determination to tie Mr. Hicks's compensation closely to Alleghany's financial performance and its views of the challenge of meeting the financial performance goals for the 2018-2021 award period in light of the current interest rate and (re)insurance market environments. For 2018 performance share awards, the opportunities for each of our Named Executive Officers, expressed as a percentage of salary, were the same as those set forth above for 2017, except for Mr. Hicks whose opportunity at target was increased to 460% of salary from 450% of salary. 
In making performance share awards for the 2018-2021 period, the Compensation Committee considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alleghany's financial objective in the current economic environment of growing book value per share at rates  of 7-10% over the long term without employing excessive amounts of financial leverage or taking imprudent risks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the prevailing financial and economic conditions and uncertainties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the alignment of performance goals with Alleghany's near-term strategy, with a particular emphasis on  maintaining Alleghany's financial strength;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• its desire to set performance goals at levels high enough to encourage strong performance but still reasonably  attainable to avoid encouraging the use of excessive financial leverage or taking of imprudent risks; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the current 10-year U.S. Treasury rates and equity risk premiums adjusted  for Alleghany's estimated stock volatility relative to the market.  
[END TABLE]
Taking into account such conditions, the Compensation Committee set the following performance goals for the 2018-2021 period: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maximum payouts at 150% of the value of one share of common stock on the payout date for average annual compound  growth in our Book Value Per Share (as defined by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the 2017 LTIP) of 9% or more over the four-year award period ending December 31, 2021, as adjusted for stock dividends;  
[END TABLE]
-55- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• target payouts at 100% of the value of one share of common stock on the payout date if such growth equals 7%, and  payouts at 50% of the value of one share of common stock on the payout date if such growth equals 5%, with payouts for growth between the foregoing levels to be determined by straight line interpolation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no payouts if such growth is less than 5%.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believed that the above payout thresholds would continue to be challenging to meet, particularly in light of slow economic growth, a prolonged period of very low interest rates when a significant portion of Alleghany's (re)insurance subsidiary investment assets are required to be held in high-quality fixed income securities, relatively high current valuations in equity markets and the imperative to maintain underwriting discipline, even if it means shrinking top-line growth, in the continuing extremely competitive reinsurance and insurance markets due to an abundance of both traditional and new alternative underwriting capacity. 
Restricted Stock Units 
In 2018, long-term incentive opportunities for Mr. Dalrymple and Mr. Sennott included restricted stock units, representing awards set at 50% of their respective base salaries, which cliff-vest four years from date of grant. These grants of restricted stock units are intended to further balance risk in our long-term incentive program and maintain a focus on rewarding longer-term performance. 
Perquisites 
Our general practice is to not provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executive Officers. In 2018, no Named Executive Officer received more than $10,000 in perquisites or other personal benefits. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
We credit an amount equal to 15% of a Named Executive Officer's base salary to the Deferred Compensation Plan each year. Entitlement to this savings benefit is not based on performance. As it is our intention that a significant portion of compensation for our Named Executive Officers be contingent on performance objectives, the savings benefit offered by the Deferred Compensation Plan provides a stable component of total compensation. In addition, the Deferred Compensation Plan permits our Named Executive Officers to elect to defer the receipt, and thus the taxation, of all or part of their base salary and their annual cash bonus. A participant may choose to have savings benefit credit amounts and deferred salary and bonus amounts either credited with interest, treated as though invested in our common stock or increased or decreased by an amount proportionate to the growth or decline in our stockholders' equity per share. 
Retirement Plan 
Retirement benefits for our Named Executive Officers are provided under the Retirement Plan. Under the Retirement Plan, a participant must have completed five years of service with Alleghany or a subsidiary of Alleghany before he or she is vested in, and thus has a right to receive, any retirement benefits following his or her termination of employment. Effective December 31, 2013, the Retirement Plan was closed to new participants and no additional benefits for existing participants accrue after such date. Any participant who was not vested in his or her accrued benefit as of December 31, 2013 will continue to have future service with Alleghany credited toward the Retirement Plan's five-year vesting requirement. 
-56- 
Financial Statement Restatements 
It is our Board's policy that the Compensation Committee will, to the extent permitted by governing law, have the sole and absolute authority to make retroactive negative adjustments to any cash or equity-based incentive compensation awarded or paid to any of our officers where the award or payment was predicated upon the achievement of performance goals that were subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of any such award or payment. In this regard, the Compensation Committee is authorized to have Alleghany seek to recover any amount the Compensation Committee determines was inappropriately received by any officer. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
We maintain a policy on insider trading and compliance that prohibits our officers from directly or indirectly purchasing or using financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Alleghany securities they own. In addition, under such policy, officers are prohibited from pledging Alleghany securities as collateral. 
Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We expect our executive officers to achieve ownership of our common stock having an aggregate value (based upon the higher of market value or book value) equal to a multiple of base salary, as follows: for our President and chief executive officer, the multiple is five times base salary; for our Executive Vice President, the multiple is four times base salary; for our Senior Vice Presidents, the multiple is three times base salary; and for our Vice Presidents, the multiple is one times base salary. We expect our executive officers to retain 75% of the shares of common stock (net of taxes) paid out to them under our long-term incentive plans until they achieve their applicable ownership levels, and they are expected to maintain such levels thereafter. 
Tax Considerations 
The TCJA substantially modified Section 162(m) of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the "Code," and, among other things, eliminated the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018. As a result, beginning in 2018, compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million will generally be nondeductible, regardless of whether it is performance-based. In addition, beginning in 2018, the executive officers subject to Section 162(m), or, the "Covered Employees," will include any individual who served as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers (other than the chief executive officer and chief financial officer) for the taxable year, and once an individual becomes a Covered Employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will remain a Covered Employee for all future years, including following any termination of employment. 
The TCJA includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) described above will not apply to compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not materially modified after that date. To the extent applicable to existing contracts and awards, the Compensation Committee may avail itself of this transition rule. However, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition rule, no assurances can be given at this time that our existing contracts and awards, even if in place on November 2, 2017, will meet the requirements of the transition rule. Moreover, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the company, the Compensation Committee does not limit its actions with respect to executive compensation to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) if the Compensation Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of Alleghany.

Compensation Policies and Practices Relating to Risk Management 
Risk analysis has always been part of our design and review of our group-wide executive incentive plans, and the Compensation Committee regularly monitors compensation policies, practices and outstanding awards to determine whether our risk management and incentive objectives are being met with respect to group-wide employee incentives. Our material risks include investment risk (debt and equity), as well as catastrophe losses and material mispricing of risk at our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. The Board's and management's risk oversight is discussed on page 15. The Compensation Committee does not believe that risks arising from our group-wide compensation policies and practices for our employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Alleghany. In this regard, as discussed on page 43, our short- and long-term incentive plans are capped at individual levels so as not to incent imprudent risk taking to achieve outsized payouts. In addition, our officers are required to own a substantial amount of common stock to ensure that they maintain a significant stake in our long-term success, and we have in place a compensation clawback policy applicable to our officers to further discourage imprudent risk taking. Further, we do not grant stock options to officers as we do not wish to reward or punish them for exogenous short-term market price movements. The management teams of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are incented to write profitable business and have no incentives to grow premium volume by underpricing risk. The Compensation Committee seeks to set realistic incentive goals, monitors them in light of economic conditions and our strategy and risk appetite, and will consider appropriate adjustments in respect thereof in the event of any conflict between incentives and the Board's strategy and risk appetite.

Narrative Discussion Relating to the Summary Compensation Table and 
Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
Change in Pension Value 
Effective December 31, 2013, the Retirement Plan was closed to new participants and was "frozen" for existing participants so that no additional benefits would accrue after such date. Despite the freezing of the Retirement Plan, the Summary Compensation Table on page 59 may still show an increase or decrease in the value of our Named Executive Officers' pension benefits. These changes in value are primarily driven by external variables, such as the discount rate, the mortality tables used and the passage of time. Set out below is a table showing the components of the change in pension value for the years 2016-2018 for our Named Executive Officers who are participants in the Retirement Plan.

(2)  For the Retirement Plan year ending in 2016, Alleghany elected to change the mortality assumption used to  compute the present values for annuities to the RP-2014 base table with white collar adjustment and Scale MP-2016, which reflect updated mortality tables issued by the  Society of Actuaries in October 2016. In accordance with the Retirement Plan, the same mortality table change, using a male/female (50/50) blended basis, applied to the calculation of lump sums. For the Retirement Plan years ending in 2017 and 2018,  respectively, Alleghany did not change the mortality assumptions.

Employment Agreement with Weston M. Hicks 
On October 7, 2002, Alleghany and Mr. Hicks entered into an employment agreement pursuant to which Mr. Hicks agreed to serve as Executive Vice President of Alleghany. Pursuant to the terms of this employment agreement, Mr. Hicks's salary is to be reviewed annually. In addition, if Mr. Hicks's employment is terminated by Alleghany other than for "Cause" or other than in the case of his "Total Disability," Alleghany will continue to pay his base salary in accordance with Alleghany's regular payroll practices after such termination until such payments aggregate $1,000,000 on a gross basis. "Cause" is defined as conviction of a felony; willful failure to implement reasonable directives of the Chairman or the Board after written notice, which failure is not corrected 
-62- 
 within ten days following notice thereof; or gross misconduct in connection with the performance of any of Mr. Hicks's duties. "Total Disability" is defined as Mr. Hicks's inability to discharge his duties due to physical or mental illness or accident for one or more periods totaling six months during any consecutive twelve-month period. The employment agreement was the result of an arm's-length negotiation between the Executive Committee of the Board and Mr. Hicks and was approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board. The Executive Committee determined that such provisions were appropriate and helpful in recruiting Mr. Hicks, and the Compensation Committee and the Board approved such determination. 
Employment Agreement with Joseph P. Brandon 
On November 20, 2011, Alleghany and Mr. Brandon entered into an employment agreement which became effective on March 6, 2012 upon the closing of the TransRe acquisition, under which Mr. Brandon agreed to serve as Executive Vice President of Alleghany. Pursuant to the terms of this employment agreement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Brandon's salary is to be reviewed annually for increases but shall not be decreased.

• If Mr. Brandon's employment is terminated by Alleghany other than for "Cause" or other than  in the case of his "Total Disability," Alleghany will continue to pay his base salary in accordance with Alleghany's regular payroll practices after such termination until such payments aggregate $1,000,000 on a gross basis.  "Cause" is defined as conviction of a felony; willful failure to implement reasonable directives of Alleghany's chief executive officer after written notice, which failure is not corrected within ten days following notice thereof; or  willful gross misconduct in connection with the performance of any of Mr. Brandon's duties. "Total Disability" is defined as Mr. Brandon's inability to discharge his duties due to physical or mental illness or accident  for one or more periods totaling six months during any consecutive twelve-month period.

• Mr. Brandon and Alleghany entered into a restricted stock unit matching grant agreement dated as of  March 6, 2012, whereby Mr. Brandon was to receive a restricted stock unit matching grant under the 2007 LTIP of one restricted stock unit for every share of common stock Mr. Brandon purchased or received pursuant to stock dividends on  those purchased shares, or "JPB Owned Shares," on or before September 3, 2012 up to a maximum of $5.0 million worth of common stock. Material terms of this matching grant agreement, or the "JPB Matching Grant  Agreement," are discussed below.  
[END TABLE]
The employment agreement was the result of an arm's-length negotiation between the Board and Mr. Brandon and was approved by the Compensation Committee and the Board. The Board determined that such provisions were appropriate and helpful in recruiting Mr. Brandon and completing the TransRe acquisition. 
2012 Restricted Stock Unit Matching Grant Award to Mr. Brandon 
Between March 6, 2012 and September 3, 2012, Mr. Brandon purchased 9,023 shares of common stock and, pursuant to the JPB Matching Grant Agreement, Alleghany credited him with 9,023 restricted stock units. These restricted stock units are notional units of measurement denominated in shares of common stock and entitle Mr. Brandon to payment on account of such restricted stock units in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value, as defined in the JPB Matching Grant Agreement, on the payment date of a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of restricted stock units to which Mr. Brandon is entitled to payment. 
Pursuant to the terms of the JPB Matching Grant Agreement, the restricted stock units vest over a seven-year period, with 15% of the restricted stock units vesting on each of the first six anniversaries of the date of grant and 10% of the restricted stock units vesting on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant. The restricted stock units are to be paid in cash and/or shares of common stock, as the Compensation Committee may determine within ten business days of the applicable vesting date. If Mr. Brandon is terminated without Cause or by reason of his death or Total Disability (as such terms are defined in the JPB Matching Grant Agreement), the 
-63- 
 restricted stock units scheduled to vest during such year shall vest on a pro rata basis for the amount of time Mr. Brandon was employed during such year. If Mr. Brandon voluntarily terminates his employment or Alleghany terminates his employment for Cause, all unvested restricted units shall be forfeited. Mr. Brandon has no voting or other rights in respect of the restricted stock units. 
Mr. Brandon must maintain unencumbered beneficial ownership of the JPB Owned Shares continuously throughout the period commencing with the initial purchase of JPB Owned Shares and ending on the earliest to occur of (i) March 6, 2019, (ii) Mr. Brandon's termination of employment for any reason or (iii) a merger approved by the Board effectuated by a tender offer or other major corporate transaction approved by the Board with respect to Alleghany's common stock. To the extent Mr. Brandon fails to do so, he will forfeit one restricted stock unit for each JPB Owned Share with respect to which he has not maintained unencumbered beneficial ownership for the required period of time.

The Deferred Compensation Plan, which was established in January 1982 and amended and restated in December 2014, provides for unfunded deferred compensation arrangements for Alleghany officers and certain other employees. The following descriptions of "Savings Benefit Provisions" and "Compensation Deferral Provisions" of the Deferred Compensation Plan generally apply to amounts that were earned and vested under the Deferred Compensation Plan after December 31, 2004. Amounts earned and vested before January 1, 2005, or the "Pre-409A Benefits," are subject to less stringent requirements concerning the time of payment of benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan, but the substantive provisions that apply to the Pre-409A Benefits are generally the same as described below. 
Savings Benefit Provisions 
All officers, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan on the date of election or appointment as an officer of Alleghany. 
Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, each calendar quarter, we credit a book reserve account for each officer who is a participant at any time during such quarter with an amount equal to 3.75% of the officer's base annual salary. This quarterly credit results in an annual credit of 15% of a participant's base annual salary, which we refer to as the "Savings Benefit Credit." Each participant may elect to have those amounts either credited with: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• interest at the prime rate or, the "Prime Rate Alternative;"  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• treated as though invested in common stock, or the "Common Stock Alternative;" or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• increased or decreased by an amount proportionate to the growth or decline of Alleghany stockholders' equity  per share, or the "Stockholders' Equity Alternative."  
[END TABLE]
In general, payment of these amounts is made or commences on the date elected by the participant, which may not be later than 12 months following termination of employment, either in a lump sum or in installments as elected by the participant. If a participant chooses the Prime Rate Alternative, that interest is computed from the date the Savings Benefit Credit is credited until the date that the amount is distributed to the participant or the date that the participant elects the Common Stock Alternative or the Stockholders' Equity Alternative. The "prime rate" for purposes of the Deferred Compensation Plan means the rate of interest announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank as its prime rate at the close of the last business day of each month, which rate is deemed to remain in effect through the last business day of the next month. 
Amounts treated as invested in common stock reflect the investment experience which the account would have had if the amounts had been invested, without commissions or other transaction expenses, and held in whole or fractional shares of common stock during the deferral period. These amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect cash and stock dividends, stock splits, and other similar distributions or transactions which, from time to time, occur with respect to common stock. Dividends and other distributions are automatically credited at their cash value or the fair market value of any non-cash dividend or other distribution and are deemed to purchase common stock on the date of payment thereof. Common stock is deemed acquired, and is valued for purposes of payout or transfer, at a price per share equal to the mean between the high and low prices thereof on the applicable date on the NYSE Consolidated Tape. A participant's ability to elect to have his or her Savings Benefit Credit amounts treated as invested (or not invested) in our common stock is subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. 
With respect to 2018, Mr. Hicks elected the Stockholders' Equity Alternative to apply to his Savings Benefit Credit; Mr. Brandon elected to have the Prime Rate Alternative apply to his Savings Benefit Credit; Mr. Sennott elected the Common Stock Alternative to apply to his Savings Benefit Credit; and Mr. Dalrymple elected to have the Stockholders' Equity Alternative apply to 50% of his Savings Benefit Credit and to have the Prime Rate Alternative apply to 50% of his Savings Benefit Credit. 
-66- 
Compensation Deferral Provisions 
The Deferred Compensation Plan provides that participants may elect to defer all or part of their base salary and annual incentive compensation each year other than compensation that would be paid in the form of common stock. Thus, currently, no long-term incentive compensation payable pursuant to the 2012 LTIP or 2017 LTIP may be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with interest at the prime rate, unless a participant elects the Common Stock Alternative or the Stockholders' Equity Alternative. A participant's decision to have deferred amounts treated as invested (or not invested) in common stock is also subject to compliance with applicable securities laws.

(1)  Reflects the estimated present value of the retirement benefit accumulated under the Retirement Plan as of  December 31, 2018 by the Named Executive Officers, based in part on (i) their years of credited service as of December 31, 2013, as indicated in the table, and (ii) the Named Executive Officers' average compensation as of  December 31, 2013 as determined under the Retirement Plan, which was $2,425,000 for Mr. Hicks, $1,000,000 for Mr. Brandon and $459,167 for Mr. Dalrymple.

(2)  Mr. Sennott commenced employment on April 16, 2013. In light of the expected amendment to the  Retirement Plan which occurred in July 2013 and was effective December 31, 2013, the Board did not designate Mr. Sennott as a participant in the Retirement Plan.  
[END TABLE]
The Retirement Plan provides retirement benefits for our employees who are elected officers and who are designated as participants by the Board, including the Named Executive Officers. On July 16, 2013, the Board approved an amendment to the Retirement Plan effective December 31, 2013, whereby the Retirement Plan was closed to new participants and no additional benefit accruals would occur for existing participants after such date. Pursuant to this amendment, base compensation and future years of service are not taken into account when calculating a participant's retirement benefits. However, future years of service with Alleghany by any participant who was not vested in his or her accrued benefit as of the freeze date will continue to have such service credited toward the Retirement Plan's five-year vesting requirement. Furthermore, such future years of service will count towards early retirement eligibility and early retirement benefits determination for all participants. On November 17, 2015, the Board approved an amendment, or the "Plan Amendment," to the Retirement Plan effective December 31, 2015. The Plan Amendment provides for the automatic adjustment of the mortality table used to make certain calculations in the Retirement Plan, in order to reflect revised mortality projections determined by Alleghany in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. 
-67- 
Retirement benefits are paid, following termination of employment, in the form of an annuity for the joint lives of a participant and his or her spouse or, alternatively, actuarially equivalent forms of benefits, including a lump sum. Prior to January 1, 2011, the annual retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan, if paid in the form of a joint and survivor life annuity to a married participant who retires on reaching age 65 with 15 or more years of service, was equal to 67% of the participant's highest average annual base salary and annual cash bonus over a consecutive three-year period during the last ten years or, if shorter, the full calendar years of employment. On December 13, 2010, pursuant to authority delegated by the Board, the Compensation Committee amended the Retirement Plan, effective January 1, 2011, by eliminating the inclusion of annual cash bonuses earned for years subsequent to 2010 in the computation of benefits. As amended, the annual retirement benefit would be the greater of (i) the retirement benefit accrued by the participant at December 31, 2010, based upon eligibility for vesting and years of service credited at such date, pursuant to the benefit formula in effect at December 31, 2010, or (ii) a full service retirement benefit, if paid in the form of a joint and survivor annuity to a married participant who retires on reaching age 65 based upon years of service credited at December 31, 2013, equal to 67% of the participant's highest average annual base salary over a consecutive three-year period during the ten years ending December 31, 2013 or, if shorter, the full calendar years of employment. The retirement benefit payable to a participant who retires on reaching age 65 with more than five but fewer than 15 years of service will equal the amount produced by the formula set forth in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of the participant's years of service at December 31, 2013 and the denominator of which is 15, or, if greater, the retirement benefit accrued at December 31, 2010. 
For purposes of the formula, base salary is the amount that would be included in the salary column of the Summary Compensation Table for the relevant years. For computations involving years when annual cash bonuses are included in the formula for determining the amount of the retirement benefit, the cash bonus is the amount of the cash bonus earned under the 2005 MIP or predecessor plan or any other annual incentive bonus plan or discretionary annual award that would be included in either the Bonus or Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table as earned in respect of the relevant years. The Retirement Plan's benefit formula contains a factor which will reduce a married participant's benefit payments to the extent that a participant is older than his or her spouse. 
If a participant becomes totally disabled prior to retirement, then for the period of total disability the participant is treated as earning annual base salary in an amount which is equal to his or her annual base salary at the time of disability, with such base salary amount adjusted annually for inflation. Further, a participant's period of disability will be treated as continued employment for all purposes under the Retirement Plan, including for purposes of determining his or her years of service. 
A participant who has terminated employment may start to receive benefits under the Retirement Plan as early as age 55, but the benefit payable at that time will be reduced to reflect the commencement of benefit payments prior to Normal Retirement Age, which is defined as age 65 with 15 years of service. A participant who terminated employment with us after reaching age 55 and completing at least 20 years of service, or after reaching age 60 and completing at least 10 years of service, will have a smaller reduction (a reduction equal to 3% of his or her accrued benefit) than a participant who terminated employment prior to reaching such age or completing such number of years of service (a reduction equal to 6% of his or her accrued benefit), and therefore has a subsidized early retirement benefit. The benefit payable to a participant who retires after Normal Retirement Age is increased to the greater of (i) the benefit taking into account additional years of service, salary increases and (for years prior to 2011) bonuses paid through the actual date of retirement or (ii) the benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the lump sum that would have been payable at Normal Retirement Age, such lump sum increased with interest to reflect the passage of time since Normal Retirement Age. For all purposes of the Retirement Plan, a participant's years of service are the number of years, including a fraction thereof, included in the period which starts on the date he or she becomes a participant, and which ends on the date his or her employment with us terminates. 
-68- 
As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Hicks was age 62 and had 16 years of credited service (for the purpose of early retirement qualification), thus he could have retired and begun to receive a retirement benefit as of that date. If Mr. Hicks had retired on December 31, 2018, the present value of his early retirement benefit would have been $14,557,346. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Brandon was age 59 and had 6 years of credited service (for the purpose of early retirement qualification), thus he could have retired and begun to receive a retirement benefit as of that date. If Mr. Brandon had retired on December 31, 2018, the present value of his early retirement benefit would have been $1,003,751. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Dalrymple was under age 55, thus he would not have been eligible to receive a subsidized early retirement benefit if he had retired as of that date. If Mr. Dalrymple had retired on December 31, 2018, the present value of his retirement benefits assuming commencement at his earliest retirement date and reflecting his benefit elections under Section 409A of the Code would have been $1,620,843. As noted above, in anticipation of the closing of the Retirement Plan to new participants effective December 31, 2013, the Board did not designate Mr. Sennott as a participant in the Retirement Plan. 
Payments Upon Termination of Employment 
The table below provides information regarding the amounts that Messrs. Hicks, Brandon, Dalrymple, and Sennott would be eligible to receive upon any termination of employment by Alleghany other than for "Cause," if such termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2018:

Certain of our Named Executive Officers would be entitled to payments in the event of the termination of their employment. These payments, other than those that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of the Named Executive Officers and that are generally available to all salaried employees, are described below. 
Pursuant to their employment agreements with Alleghany, Mr. Hicks and Mr. Brandon would be each entitled to receive continued payments of his base salary until such payments aggregate $1.0 million on a gross basis, payable in accordance with our normal payroll and procedures, following termination of his employment other than for Cause or in the event of his death or Total Disability. As described in more detail on pages 63 and 64, the JPB Matching Grant Agreement provides for a pro rata payment in the event of the termination of employment without Cause or termination of employment by reason of Mr. Brandon's death or Total Disability. The foregoing agreements generally define "Cause" to mean conviction of a felony; willful failure to implement reasonable directives of the Chairman or the Board, as well as Alleghany's chief executive officer in Mr. Brandon's case, after written notice, which failure is not corrected within ten days following notice thereof; or gross misconduct in connection with the performance of any of their duties. "Total Disability" in the foregoing agreements generally is defined to mean inability to discharge duties due to physical or mental illness or accident for one or more periods totaling six months during any consecutive twelve-month period. 
Other than the foregoing, there are no individual arrangements that would provide payments to our Named Executive Officers upon termination other than for cause or in the event of death or disability. We do not have any arrangements with our Named Executive Officers that would provide for payments upon a change of control of Alleghany or upon a change of control and subsequent termination of employment; although the JPB Matching Grant Agreement does provide that Mr. Brandon's holding requirement for JPB Owned Shares will lapse upon a change of control. 
A number of the plans described in this Proxy Statement have provisions that may result in payments upon termination of employment under certain circumstances as described below. 
2012 LTIP and 2017 LTIP 
Awards under our 2012 LTIP and 2017 LTIP provide for the pro rata payment of outstanding awards in the event of the termination of employment prior to the end of the award period. With respect to awards under the 2012 LTIP and 2017 LTIP, the pro rata payment would be based on the elapsed portion of the award period prior to termination and average annual compound growth in Book Value Per Share through the December 31st immediately prior to date of termination, as determined by the Compensation Committee.

Our 2015 MIP also provides that, in the event of a participant's death or disability prior to the end of the award period for an outstanding award, the participant (or in the event of the participant's death, the participant's beneficiary) shall receive such portion of the award, if any, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. If the employment of a participant who has received a qualifying award is otherwise terminated during an award period, the participant shall not be entitled to receive any payment for such award unless the performance goals applicable to such award are achieved and certified by the Compensation Committee, in which case the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that the participant shall be entitled to receive all or any part of the qualifying award that would be payable to the participant upon the achievement of those performance goals. Pursuant to the 2015 MIP, if a participant who has received a non-qualifying award terminates employment for any reason (other than death or disability), the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that the participant is entitled to receive payment of all or any part of the non-qualifying award.

Retirement Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan 
Additional payments upon any termination of employment would be made under our Retirement Plan, as long as the employee is eligible to receive benefits under the Retirement Plan at the time of the termination of employment. Our Deferred Compensation Plan also provides for payments of a participant's vested savings benefit in the event of any termination of employment in the form previously elected by a participant subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, as applicable, or if no election has been made, in a lump sum. Termination of employment will not cause an enhanced payment or other benefit to be made under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Information with respect to the Retirement Plan is set forth on pages 67 through 69, and information with respect to the Deferred Compensation Plan is set forth on pages 66 and 67. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer. For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our median employee of all employees of our company (other than our chief  executive officer) was $61,805; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer was $9,056,352.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information for 2018, we reasonably estimate that the ratio of our chief executive officer's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 147:1. Our pay ratio estimate has been calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. 
To identify our median employee, we first determined our employee population as of December 31, 2018, or the "Determination Date." We had 5,305 employees, representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees, including our chief executive officer, as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or "leased" workers, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. Our employee population excludes approximately 4,520 employees in Concord and approximately 805 employees in Hirschfeld Industries, both of which we acquired in 2018. 
Using our payroll records, we then measured the employee population's taxable income for the period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018. We did not annualize the compensation for employees in temporary or seasonal positions or make any full-time equivalent adjustments. For our employees who were paid in currency other than U.S. dollars, these amounts were converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for 2018. 
Once we identified our median employee, we then determined that employee's total compensation, including any perquisites and other benefits, in the same manner that we determine the total compensation of our Named Executive Officers for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table disclosed above. For 2018, the total compensation of our median employee was determined to be $61,805. For 2018, the total compensation of our chief executive officer was $9,056,352. Based on the foregoing, the total compensation amount for our median employee was compared to that of our chief executive officer to determine the pay ratio. 
-71- 
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS 
The By-Laws, which are available on Alleghany's website at www.alleghany.com, require that Alleghany be furnished with written notice with respect to:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the submission of a proposal, other than a proposal submitted by or at the direction of the Board, at a meeting  of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
In order for any such nomination or submission to be proper, the notice must contain certain information concerning the nominating or proposing stockholder and the nominee or the proposal, as the case may be, and must be furnished to Alleghany generally not less than 30 days prior to the meeting.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
At any time prior to their being voted, proxies are revocable by written notice to the Secretary of Alleghany at Alleghany's principal executive offices, submitting a new proxy dated later than the date of the revoked proxy, or by appearance at the 2019 Annual Meeting and voting in person. A quorum comprising the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Alleghany's common stock on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy for the transaction of business at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Solicitation of proxies will be made by mail, courier, telephone, facsimile or e-mail and, to the extent necessary, by personal interviews. Alleghany will bear the expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies. Brokers, custodians and fiduciaries will be requested to transmit proxy material to the beneficial owners of common stock held of record by such persons at Alleghany's expense. Alleghany has retained Georgeson to aid in the solicitation of proxies, and for its services Alleghany expects to pay fees of approximately $9,500 plus expenses.
